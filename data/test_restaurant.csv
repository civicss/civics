vsFFbN71ehRCp46KeR5RdQ,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"Fab.U.Lous. Best scrambles eggs. Fluffy and tasty. Servings so large teenage athletes had leftovers. Been to Scrambled, US Egg, and we all vote Butterfields. The orange juice is absolutely delicious. Everyone was so nice despite the packed place, and they were fast too. Try it, they won't disappointed."
Jj8ubiwwuCR-rrhrrjcryw,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,2,"Been here 3x and no beef #45, will stop coming; what's the point if it's always out. Take it off the menu since it's never available. Portions getting smaller, prices going up. And the table that came after us got to order first."
YTbKmjGTdn4YzoJXTC1u7g,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"Nice place, games for younger kids, bar like feel for adults, missing the mark for teens; we tried hot dogs, burgers, sample platter, a little on the salty side, but otherwise OK.

Come early to avoid crowds/lines."
F9cXFXk60E2sz_YTSCFp_Q,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"Drive thru: I guess it's opposite day at the drive thru.  Apparently a 'no, thank you' to 'do you want some ketchup' means 17 (I counted) ackets of ketchup for 1 order of fries. Less a star because I'm not a fan of people being wasteful. I know it's just a little thing, but it irks me."
OX0T9dWI8b7meu-ljTo22A,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"Friendliest staff, no matter how swamped they are. Always smiling and gracious. Garlic parm and lemon pepper wings. Mmmmmmmm.

Love the simplicity of the place and the trinkets all over the walls, always discover something new."
e9UsRb-fmza5ukU8Ftduew,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,2,"Overall rating: 2.5 for a 4:30 weekday visit (no one at the bar and 4 tables, including us - mostly parties of 2, like us).

I've decided to count, from entering an establishment to the time our party is spotted to the time we are acknowledged or helped (no, I don't  speed count). This visit, it was 5 before we were spotted and 82 before a hostess came to seat us.

Place was clean, server prompt, nice. Salmon was dry, overcooked. Walnut and tempura shrimp were good but warm/cool, not hot. Liked the tofu and veggies. Fried prawns were tasty. Crab legs? Crab legs, nothing spectacular. The fried rice? Hardened, couldn't pay me to eat it. All the meat dishes, with the exception of almost well done prime rib (not happy that there was no one at the carving station to cut or anyone to call and ask) had an after taste of cough medicine - so did the tapioca, but cake was ok.

Also almost got run over by the hostess while on my way to get food, she was rushing toward the empty side of the restaurant. My response? Smile, and an 'oh, sorry excuse me.' Hers a raised eyebrow that became a frown and a parting huff. Wanna pay over $20 for that plus tax and tip? Go for it lol, I'll pass."
nUaLFTfUqVKMFQonsWBnag,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,4,"4 because there's this one cashier who, each time rang our purchases up (different weeks) always looked like a mix of anger and unhappiness for customers im general.

Store is clean, but I gotta say...having clothes for sale...somehow... I no longer wanna call it 'fancy frys' it now seems more like...'wannabe walmart.'

Almost down to a 3 thanks to that, BUT the pharmacy staff....AweSOME! Super courteous and helpful, really great empathy toward each customer. Not an easy task but they are shining stars in my book."
-YR7K3rw6VAQ1-MjslvsoQ,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"2.5 stars. We've come here several times over the past few years and management is always different. This review is for   current management, supposedly 'original' management.

I like that we no longer have to order and pay at the counter. We usually order calamari or calamari salad, katsu don.  This time the calamari was crispy but bland, the dipping sauce - no, thank you: tasted like mix of wasabi, tartar, and soap. Soy sauce saved the calamari.

Katsu don was super delicious and fresh. I was starving, finished mine and then went into a food coma.

Staff was pleasant but the lower score is because: the place wasn't super busy (3 other tables, small parties 2-3 per table), and yet when we got there, our table was dirty - wiped away grease streak, 2 pcs of food laying on the table.

This place is closer to me than Tokyo Express...so I guess we'll come back."
1VKjDpPJdVoiRc8I9f7U9g,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,2,"Meh. 6 skinny mozzarella sticks for $7. It's an appetizer for and 1 adult and 1 toddler. Wish we just went to Costco to get a whole bag, but my teens were h-anger-y ;)

Wednesday wings, glad they still have it. Stick with the original. I wouldn't recommend their wing sauce; their garlic parm is nothing compared to Long Wongs or Buffalo Wild Wings.

Fries were bland. The staff...they seemed ""nice"" but...off... 2-3x our server and this dude walked by said ""how's everything going/tasting"" and they kept walking without stopping or even really lookong at our table because each time that happened, one person in our party had an empty drink. They were just going through the smiles and verbal motions without actually...serving.

Would I go back to Hooters? Yes. This one? Neeeevvvaaahhhhhhh, go DOWNTOWN, not here."
6D4L8YpkhAh_YwaLmhoMNg,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"Happy to be seated promptly on a Friday evening.  5 stars to Deb our waitress who was so pleasant, never let our drinks get low, and so quick to answer our questions.

My princess enjoyed her mac n cheese, the fettuccine was creamy, trio was huge, calamari = tasty. Spaghetti, meatballs and pomodoro were divine.

So why not a perfect rating? While we lucked out with Deb, I'm just not sure how others fared with the people helping them. Usually when we walk into or out of a restaurant, staff smile and say hi, say, ""welcome to..."" or acknowledge patrons in some way shape or form. Yesterday, all 4 of us were greeted with blank stares (again, except Deb)."
7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"Deeeeeeeeeeellllliiiissssshhhhhh!  More than a pleasant surprise, it's a super tasty delight. I expected yummy food and well, this was.....*sigh*.... ahhhhhhhhhhhh.

Regular fries were seasoned so well, burgers juicy, each item we tried had it's own flavor but blended really well together. Fresno chicken tacos....zing creeps up on you, paired with the sweetness of the carnival corn....more aaaahhhhhhs.

And the french toast fries.....OMG so good! Stop reading this and go there already (bring your friends and order different things so you can try it all)."
SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"Been coming here for years, always delicious food, served super fast, no matter how busy.

Service is excellent! Looking for real asian food? Head out to what my family calls, ""Super D.""

Pan fried noodles, salt and pepper pork chop are our faves."
mDNh9K4eOIfjiZb1DlV88A,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,4,"If only it wasn't in a casino, I'd give it a 5 and come back more often. Thankfully, no smell of smoke inside.

We were seated promptly at a booth and had a good time. Came here expecting over priced, bland food. Apparently I was in for a surprise.

Our server was prompt and nice. Hubby gave him 8 out of 10 rating (we ran too low on drinks once). The foooooood.....best calamari ever! Crispy, soft, and TASTY without the deep fried oily feeling. Don't usually like tartar sauce but loved this one.

Linguini was delicious-nice, subtle zing and scrumptious prawn.  Steak was succulent and delectable. We didn't have room for dessert because the portions were huge.

Reasonably priced for great food and large portions."
9E1q2uEMd881wnruicNTUA,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"My last review was a novel, this will be short. Ordered online for pick up, food was handed to me at EXACTLY that time, not a minute later. Aaarrrmmmyyygaaawwwd amazing!

Why the 3? One order was wrong :( BUT it was pretty good anyway so I'll leave it be. We're all human after all."
szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"Best place for dim sum in the valley.  Prefer this one to the one at Mekong Plaza in Mesa.  Pork siomai is the family favorite. Calamari is the bomb, when the cook isn't in (he gets in about 10-11am on weekends), we get the Salt and Pepper squid from the a la carte menu. Shrimp egg rolls, mmmmmmm."
SvlTuwslYKdqvqWtDe2dgA,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,1,"Food taste: 2
Time to receive food: 3
Customer Service: - 5 (yes, that's a negative)
Cleanliness: 3
Accuracy of order: 0

Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

My advice to management: Tell staff to read, slow down, listen and understand how important customer service is.

Advice to Yelpers: Smash Burger or In N Out. Taste hasn't changed, service much better. If in Vegas, Wahlburgers."
Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"First time here started off with no line, by the time we left, drive through and inside lines were full.

Burger was ok, veggies were fresh, loved the sauce and fries. I drive by here a lot, would stop for the fries. Also, wish I had known the corn is seasonal.

Why the 3? Service. It was our first time and it was obvious, felt more like the lady ready to take our order just wanted to get it over with and us out of the way.

Like I said no line when we got there, not inside and 1 car at the drive thru.

The 4-5 will depend on service next time."
U3O8l_wmzdeckbhHpuRWCg,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,4,"We came starving and left stuffed.  Always loved and still adore their calamari. Add the breadsticks and chicken/gnocchi soup...couldn't even finish my main course.  What we 'took' for dinner will probably be for brunch tomorrow.

Jerry our server was amazing! He was the only one in our section so I can't say service was speedy, but he was always smiling and gracious with each party even though I could see 1 party getting anxious.  The fact that he kept his composure, professionalism, and remained gracious - I commend that kind of service. Kudos, Jerry!

OG management, perhaps improve scheduling during the lunch rush?"
ZmLYXTXXrrIA9qMx8rVsTA,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"Been here once before for take out, place has a chemical smell back then and am glad it's gone.  Ate in this time before our movie. Enjoyed the freshly cooked food. Like the healthy options. We came famished, left really full. Place is clean with gtiendly, efficient staff.

I did find the katsu sliced too thin it was no longer tender when fried. Sushi was ok, so was the calamari."
a58ItFHWoVwVWDqSH_9bEw,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"We've come here several times over a few years. It's always been clean (we go in the evenings). The service is great, they are all really nice, but not excessively chipper to the point of being fake. There's always so much to choose from, We always need a minute to decide ;)

Kids love the baskets and also the burgers, cheese curds and concrete mixers are their faves. I like the rueben, but it's so hearty, I can't finish it all at once. The dinners are a great value too, pot roast with salad and a roll, yuuuuummmmm!"
fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"Place is always packed for weekend dinners, harder to get in if there's more than a party for two.

Giant portions, love that there's enough to share or to munch on the followinh day.

Cheese crisp and p'zookie are our motivation to come here, wish tables were not too close together, but I get it's part of their charm, plus that would mean less tables and then there  would be a longer wait ;)"
A2pHOVp0zh7grb1bbZxoBQ,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,4,"Love the house chicken and chicken fried rice. Only ate here once a few years ago, they were super nice and food was yummy!

This is out take out spot though.  Dumplings are also good. Family fave is the chicken fried rice, mouth's watering just thinking about it. One serving is good for 3-4.

Delicious food, generous servings, friendly staff and reasonable prices, need I say more?"
gxEkxkqQrrK62DJnXxXDLg,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"Bbq, bacon burger is awesome!  Salads are great for 2. Been coming here since it opened a few years ago for take out and dine in.

Staff has always been friendly and courteous.

3 rating because we love Smash fries but over the years, it's gotten more and more greasy."
VLDFjeqpUgWhnVuB_8GuEg,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Really really cool place!  I got the shrimp over noodles dish, and my friend got beef over cattle.  Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere is awesome!  I'll definitely be back very soon!"
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,This place was so cool looking!  Real dark with a moder/futuristic type feel with glowing blue lamps and crazy shaped decorations on the wall.  The Deluxe Burger was great and you get french fries in this little shopping car.  We got the 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular fries... great!  They even serve it with Fancy Sauce (Step Brothers reference.. but true story)!
_aofcEsCpuKVqK39u03x-A,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,Awesome place... Just upset they took my salmon salad off the menu.  No more fish at all and that's what I like to eat when I'm out.  Their cookies and acai berry drink are awesome!
YmFkrylzWy4vmNFkWk-I0g,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Pretty cool place.  Because I checked in and got 15% off for doing so, I am switching my 4 star to a 5 star.  The food was great and I love places that give yelpers a deal!"
2iLeiQ4OCJVwfodR9egMag,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,Get the green tacos!  Atmosphere is great!  I don't think ill ever bowl at an amc again!  Spoiled!
EV1jAj7NFNmNIqOnwZ4Acw,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,"This place was so much fun!  The band was absolutely amazing.  The ONLY reason they didn't get a 5th star, was because I asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing, and she said ""yes, the band is awesome and they move the tables out so people can dance.""  The band WAS definitely amazing, but everyone kind of just stood there and my wife wanted to dance on her bday.  Other than that.... awesome!"
RsQdAT-eFwWpzy0t2SiReQ,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,3,Really nice people.  The food is ok.  I thought it would be better.  Everyone's taste in Italian food is different though
YmIYjZGnuZzqVPkFBF4Omw,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,nice place.  They had a great guitar player that we listened to while having a drink for my wife's birthday.
xIrFmRqK4TpwvaxlU926TQ,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,"pretty awesome place.  A lot to do and it's good for adults and kids.  My son, wife and I went to hang out with friends and had a blast.  Bowled the best game of my life!  130!! haha"
l1EzeGkWmLzAf9F1bAlFRQ,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Love this pizza!  Very close to the style back home in jersey!  People are cool, too!"
m6rffQy85HUq82DjLq-YJg,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,Went to dinner here w my wife for her bday.  Nice decor.  Food was pretty good.  Calamari was great.  Waitress was a little slow in service.  Overall... I'd go again.
Y5CTA3S9TVkpr3Yvwaki-A,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Great place!  Tickets include popcorn, pillow and blanket with waiters.  Wow!"
whAwdYVty-jSNRhrYT2zHA,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,This place has been my favorite restaurant for 10 years.  It's amazing!  I always get the Mediterranean Calamari and oysters on half shell... But truthfully... Everything is awesome!  5 star!  Highly recommend if u enjoy seafood!
Jw3iaQalS9-1aeXkKh_plA,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,3,This place is ok.  Cool atmosphere and the dishes taste pretty good.  Just a bit expensive for the portion size compared to other favorite places.
hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"This is our place!  They just started all you can eat sushi, too!  Order the volcano roll!"
7XTGtaKjANmZqp2QtN_iPA,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,Pretty cool place.  A little hole in the wall bar.  Had a fun time with friends but we had to move tables because they were about to start trivia night.  Man those guys take that seriously.  It was packed with trivia people!!!
ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Just had lunch here with my wife:  French onion soup - amazing!  Parisian Sandwich - 8 out of 10, crepe dessert with caramelized apples - 9 out of 10, atmosphere - very very cool!  Great date place!"
WWOCqk1Vh605xP-lcb9lhA,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,Seafood lunch red curry plate.  Awesome. Tiny little place but clean and comfortable atmosphere.  As soon as I walked in I smelled good food!  They have free wifi and waitress was really nice!
tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,Pretty good!  Coconut shrimp and sesame chicken is awesome.  Crab puffs are great too.
LgMCHBadv9Z8Ge94zNpDFA,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Amazing food!  I live Mexican food, but Puerto Rican food.... Wow!  Try the pernil and empanadas!  Malta Goya and flan was great too!  Definitely coming back with friends!"
yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,Great place and cool staff!  Cool atmosphere too.  Always good to know another great downtown spot!  Sit at the food bar!  The cooks are so awesome to talk to and you always have people taking care of you!  Crab legs are amazing too!!!
iUYAqWKoBdHqYNMDzOXb9w,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Me and my son's favorite place!  Get the Ecuadorean tamales and seco de pollo!  Apple soda is great too!

PS:  Expect slower service, because it is TRULY mom and pop.  If you go in with this attitude, you'll really enjoy the experience.  If you want quick, timely servers that ask you how food is every 30 seconds, you may want to try Olive Garden or something."
kv42obrz682yqpNy0yxrUA,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"Great little atmosphere to work or meet with people.  I'm not a big coffee guy, so can't tell u if that's good or not.  But, I enjoyed it and the place just has a great feel to it!"
5Jf-9U16kMW-o2k8OUvTLg,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,4,"This is flatbread (Afghan style) central my friends. If its not here, it does not exist. Real good flatbread styles from the other side of the world. Oh and the deserts are real good too, take them to go. In goodness they have tea and such on the house, as is custom. Moustafa runs a good operation here, along with the ladies kept in back. As custom too, lots of smoking and chatting outside, no need to rush off."
WfLSfwsw6iuXxpm4U6nVZQ,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,4,"Boy ole boy, this place rocks me every time I go there. It more than helps if you know some spanish, or do your homework. Otherwise all your questions will be answered like your partially deaf grandparents, 'head shaking yes...', by the short central american ladies.
I had the, Pollo Catracho-Pollo Frito Estilo Hondureño, on my last venture in there with real genuine horchata. I rolled out of the place literally. They do not miss a beat with sides and fresh condiments. For the gringos, there is the typical bottles of sauces and such. But WTF you need that for when you can eat the roasted jalepeno, onions and radishes. Damn. I have yet to go there for breakfast, because I usually want to do something in the morning rather than go back to sleep. lol. Now you know why they have them images of the mexican having a siesta on the cactus. The dude just ate here!"

But stay focused, because its also a minimart gas station, so if your a people person, like me, its like TV, they also have one blaring too. You can also feel outlawish, by getting ""free"" refills. They also have wi-fi, so you can slow your heart and arteries with greasy chicken and gravy with lots of salt and butter and comb or stalk whatever sites you desire. Plus look at all the weirdos coming and going. Oh and for you antique people, just behind this location is a big ass antique store, so you can waddle your way over, most drive, cause we americans, and settle that chicken looking at stuff you don't need."

Check it out."
CvGfyePXPjKt3btUj1h9uQ,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,2,"OK, so I had the $8.00 lunch. My first question was, what happened to these places??? Beyond the basic food, its filthy, food everywhere and the people, wow. I mean it looks like this is where obese people go to gorge. ""Oh, have a pint of ice cream and sugar to wash down that salad"" The lady in front of me was scooping some white-yellow pasta stuff out of the serving spoon with her fingers. The decor, whats with the baby shit green color and macro shots of tomatoes sweating? Tomatoes do not sweat. Oh and then some old lady in yoga pants. I mean, baggy yoga pants??? I had my salad and soup and left, the food was ok, but the patrons, leave you feeling no so good. So, if you want cheap nutrition and some OMG moments, go here."
GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,2,"My meat was dry again. When you order a drink, they give you a cup and point you to the coke machine, so service is not this place is style. Apache Blvd has become a middle eastern mecca of food, so they will have to shape up or ship out, since better and less expensive delights are all down the street."
tnG4_L5bZiffTbaFru9EBg,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,4,"These cats got it all going for them. Taste, price and coolness. If your all into the scene and need to be catered to, like your paris hilton, don't bother. It also has a great market selection, mine being the deserts and sweets. The plates have some good choice, I go the way of a main kabob, rice (mmmm), hummus and fries. They also lay on the pita bread, so its all good here. Oh, and be sure to bring someone you can converse with or something to read, its not fast food, so relax."
mJHoOJH10A-cjtRdQCV6ow,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,5,"First and foremost, this is pretty much TRADITIONAL Navajo food. Not any other native american or american indian type of food. It is the basics, because in the real Navajo world, not the material world of Phoenix and urban areas, there is no electricity and such. Its not food all jazzed up with spices and thick sauces, etc, like americans like and desire. Certainly not the salty taste that is american food, or passes for taste. So, in the area of actual Navajo food, the Scared Hogan does it well. As for the expense, its organic as you can get, but thats the Navajo food way, and not advertised and used as a gimmick, like the american food way, hence, its a bit more in cost. An example is, the mutton (sheep) is bought on the Navajo Nation. Navajo's know tis because we cantaste the difference, between a sheep raised on Navajo land vegetation and sheep not raised on it.
All in all, the Sacred Hogan, is the best traditional style Navajo food served in the greater Phoenix area, except at my house, haha."
RA1Jchnz3uQDg4YVHckKXQ,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,2,"You never know with this place. Today it was, ""We're out of that right now."" I mean, they only have two type of house coffee and one is out. The pumpkin chocolate chip cake was oily, yeah, oily and with the light coffee I settled for, it was all half and half nutmeg taste in my mouth.
Oh and its also one of those places, people with no wi-fi sit around at ;)"

If you like them good and hot, fresh, then this is your place. Somedays the special is corn dogs and they can be had a for a sweet price.
This is the place where us fat people get fat, straight up."
HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,4,"First off, if you like ambience and decor, don't go here. If you like good Asian and Pacific Rim food, then do go here. These people do not, and I mean do not, f**k around with the good food they serve. What they lack in service, sometimes you got to wait longer than it takes to grow the food, they more than make up in what they do right and thats make good food from their respective origins. To boot, you always have enough to take home, now I know its american to over eat and one serving can serve an entire Vietnam family, but its good, to have some great lunch the next day. Tip: When you go in and see one table, get it. Smile at the lady, maybe even slightly bowing and make for that table. It can get crowded. Oh, and lots and lots of TOGO orders here for those who like TV or children with their food, hence the wait."

Whats even better, is they treat you with respect. Now I know that may not play out to many people, but to me, the vibe you get from the staff, sets the tone, right off that bat, and its a good vibe here. I even take others there, when i want to be nice and have some class ;)"

Now, you would think this corporation would at least get this right, no. The meat was dry and four pieces of what passes for tomatoes in america these days, were just awful. So its on to the humus and pita bread. I mean did they store the pita in a steamer? Two of the most basics, ruined and awful."
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,3,"I have been to the UK and this version of the pasty is as good as it gets in the Valley. Its a big deal, since its a rather easy cheap thing to make, I mean its UK, right. People there are broke and always telling you. The atmosphere is basically loud white folks drinking and drinking, loud.  If they could do it take out, they would make some more dough, but it is what it is and its good to check out the other goodies."
6WDDksGLLehfQDIvQXzR5w,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,4,"One after another, so many have tried to open a food place in this very same spot. Along comes this chinese food establishment and BINGO! I have tried it a few times and the last time, it was packed, and with mostly chinese people ;)
In all my favorite is anything noodles. That tasty well seasoned wok in the kitchen sure makes it taste good every time.
The young waiter staff is at a loss every time, so you gotta take charge here, for instance, don't wait for your check. For you gringos, you gotta ask for anything more than chopsticks, cause they won't ask or provide them, but hey, get it together and learn. Food is good and consistent."
6t7mlTVjDA9fhuFAZmVzAQ,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,3,"I like the basic burger and onion rings, which they do very well. Price wise, its also a deal. The ordeal is with the double line they always form to order is awful and likewise with the pickup area, always crowded and not functional."
8F-CalsRSKiPjjsx8ql8Lg,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,3,"I go here for the fries. If you were raised on potatoes, like me, some days, all you want is fucking potatoes fried. The large portion is enough for two, so you can take some home and pull them (use a knife if your a girl) apart and fry them up with some eggs for breakfast. The other stuff is just that, nothing fancy, yet I still don't know how peanuts fit into it all. Only downside of this location is the MEGA-FLIES. I counted an average of four on my table all the time. Since I was alone, if you looked at me from afar, I looked like one of the Mill Avenue homeless, thrashing about in the corner, complete with brown bag (fries). Its worth to me."
CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,3,"Its an OK place, with decent pasta dishes, a fast food type of place with awful decor, the cheap ""urban look"". The floor is always a mess with food and trash all over, almost overtime I have been there. I like the pesto dish.."
FtLibezRe7HsT13BLpR-Dg,UqYtHGxXJK9s4ltIm6Uw_w,4,"Northern Mexico food, at its best. Beans are homemade and good, have not got sick yet, so its been fresh. You do know, 9/10 times its bad beans, when you get sick, lol.
They throw in some chips and salsa's to spoil your meal, buy hey, its up to you. Service is good and football (soccer in america) is always on, yeah.
I do breakfast here sometimes and its the spot when I am hungry after work, so its a no miss for me. Posole and menudo too, not just on every other full moon when a democrat is president ;)
They also have small bar in the back, but alcohol is not my thing so, who knows.
Check it out, don't be scared."
5cXym2kMtJgKeaxdF2SrJA,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,5,I love their all you can eat shrimp and the lobster  and crab! Every thing is fresh and great every time.  I like going even by myself.
YM-nYIHd99qUt9n62AxIAg,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,5,This is my favorite place! The salsa is great!  They are quick  and friendly and I've never had a problem!  My family and I have gone here for years.  The tamles and chimichangas are great.  The tacos are good but expensive.  The margaritas are great and cheap!
hI_WID6sP7EOgPeFFJPPwQ,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,2,What a disappointment!  I hadn't been able to come for a while and they no longer have the cute decor on the walls and they took the baked potatos off the menu!  And it wasn't clean and the booths had rips and it is extremely expensive for what  you get
rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,5,Everything is great I go here at least once a week!  I love the spring rolls and the prices are great
n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,1,I was told it was the best and thought it was awful!  The sweet and sour chicken is just Un eatable huge chunks with a lot of green bell peppers. The fried rice is mushy and the egg drop soup is just ok but how can you mess that up. I was there as a guest but I'd never go by my self
355zerURpj4IMs2no238_A,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,1,They argued with me again as to Wethersfield or not there was broccoli in the dish I asked for none and it's in it! I thought it was just two pieces but it's loaded with it I sent it back good thing I didn't do take out! I don't think I will be back sad! Now they gave me chicken instead of shrimp that I  paid for! And he is complaining!  Give me my money back. Well I was in my car and the manager came out to apologize and give me a gift card.  Unfortunately he is the same person who argued with me and blamed everything on the cashier! I told him that this has happened before and last time it was take out. Don't think I'll be back at least to this one.
8XZ4X5WUyM1sWscObramwQ,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,3,Boy for a Saturday they sure are slow! 13 people in line and the guy taking the order got the name wrong. ..weirdest spelling of Lena I've ever seen. The 43rd and bell location doesn't seem to have the same problem. Two employees didn't wear hats or hair nets what's with that what about health code?
UqhVZYUeoBGroYpZB-9jlQ,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,3,It's OK but the drinks are expensive and I've had more fun other places.  The food is good. If I were going for the bar experience I'd go somewhere else.
_B3jnaQVtDXqydea1y92fQ,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,1,I had heard about the new steak house and thought I'd try it. It was packed but I was alone so I thought it might not be that long. I wasn't welcomed and when I asked I was told it would be 45 minutes!  It was extremely loud and there was no where to sit I waited 15 minutes and the noise made me decide to go black Angus where I didn't have to wait and it was a much better atmosphere and after reading comments better food too!
cxlxJpw_vTzw7bXJq6Dbsg,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,2,Went in for the clam chowder and they didn't have it on a Saturday night!  Give me a break! And they are still pushing that nasty all you can eat shrimp!  No thanks!
i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,5,Best pizza in town!  I live at 19th Ave and cactus so it's a drive for me to go but it's worth it.  I've been  coming here since I was in high school and I miss the old man  who used to run it but his son took over.  I've never had a problem here and have carried  out and eaten in its a great place!
Do72DKBclgkSPt6jZ9-c4Q,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,1,I waited forever for a table then even longer for my order. It took over thirty minutes to get my check and it was over priced!  I waited so long for my check I actually thought about just leaving!  It was the worst  experience I've ever had I will never go back!  I miss native new yorker!
jvwzhzA9vsfJHCdlbLkHZw,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,1,I've been coming here for 24 years I didn't know that they changed ownership!  They took the pretty art off the wall wouldn't know where you are by looking no art at all looks like a bar and they changed the almond clicked it comes in big chunks and the vegetables too and they charged me for hot tea! Won't be back
fI9ErCUGY8rXRPBbatcxMA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"I can't believe I haven't been here before! What a cool place, as everyone else has said, you basically cross off what you don't like and they make everyone at the table a different meal for each course. It was an excellent meal, and everyone had a great time! I would probably give it a 5 star rating, but I really didn't like the kangaroo I had for my main course.  I've had other gamey meat like ostrich, bison, etc.. but it was never tough, this was really tough meat. Started with the Cucumber Mint Refresher which was excellent!"
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,5,"Great place for those who are eating carb-free (low carb), got the Delux Burger with a lettuce wrap, and the tomato salad as my side."
tTR9GQbdC-rEHNsECmSWRw,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,1,"I can't believe anyone thinks this is the place for brunch! The food was ok, and the service was slow.  We arrived for Sunday Brunch booked on Open Table, and found out that booking brunch on Open Table actually gives you the ""breakfast"" buffet, which is really nothing special (the free hotel buffet at Hilton Garden Inn or Holiday Inn Express is just as good and fresh). You needed a steak knife to cut the over done sausages (Denny's has better pancakes and sausages at 1/8 the price). We got a great view with our table facing the door into the hotel, not the beautiful grounds (I guess they try and jam more tables in for the brunch). The breakfast buffet at the Westin Kierland is 100 times better than Rita's, with fresher food and a much better selection. The front staff was totally apathetic and showed very poor customer service training. They blamed me, not Open Table, for booking breakfast (even though I explained I clicked on the brunch category and link)."
7pGWy3mR7gjMSE6x2njqPA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,5,"I've had both breakfast and lunch here (yes in the same day), both were amazing! Service was great, and fast (I went there on a Friday morning). For breakfast I had the mushroom & cheese stuffed omelet smothered with a sherry cream sauce, served with olive bread. VERY rich, but delicious.   They always give me a cup of coffee to go, love their attention to detail. For lunch I had the Arrogant Bastard Burger (local organic beef from the Stockyards), very tasty & huge.  They have free wi-fi and covered parking next door in the parkade."
U7fZfH9C4hj5BFRYaPOo2w,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,5,"Had a dinner party here in one of their private dining rooms.  The food, drinks, and service were all outstanding.   Started with the calamari, Antipasto (w/cured meats, artisan cheese, marinated olives, Marcona almonds, quince paste and flat bread), Crispy Calamari with aioli and
Lamb Merguez Sausage; followed by the Caprese; mozzarella, tomato and basil; and for the main course I had the Flat Iron steak, fingerling potatoes, shishito peppers, piperade sauce (cooked perfectly).  I finished off my meal with the Julia Baker Chocolate Mousse Cake.  I have to say everything was 5 star: food was fabulous, service was excellent, I'll  certainly be back again!"
B8zMmUlCIX7Ts8VSgy9B-A,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,3,"The burgers seem smaller than I remember, and the prices are NYC prices ($18 for a burger, fries and tiny custard). As others have said, the place is way over priced. Food took way too long for the 2 people in line before me. I did like the burger, and I liked not waiting in line for an hour like you need to do in NYC, but still not doing it for me."
UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"Great place for happy hour! (4-7pm). I've had both the triple sliders and the half-rack ribs (on different days btw). If you near 101 & N. Scottsdale near happy hour, this is the best place in the area to eat!"
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,5,"One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. Arrived for a late Thursday morning breakfast (11am) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Server was friendly and I had the chorizo scramble special. It was great! Very tasty and flavorful. I am one of the pickiest breakfast eaters (i.e. I don't really consider US Egg & Denny's breakfast places). I expect my eggs and all the ingredients to be fresh, and that was certainly the case at Matt's!! This is one of my two favorite breakfast places in the valley (for different reasons, I consider Matt's and the Orange Table to be complimentary)."
aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"Great restaurant!  Love the Sunday set menu, and $5 wine.  Certainly one of the better restaurants in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. Food was great, great atmosphere, Elliot is the man! Been back twice.. with consistent service & food."
QS3QxI7u5PRdtbGgI0-UsA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,5,"Had the Salmon & Tuna sushi and is was amazing. Some of the best sushi I've had in the Valley.   The sushi was generous, and very fresh (can't really ask for much more at a sushi place).  The also seem to have an assortment of rolls that are on special from Sunday-Thursday night, but the sushi was so filling, I couldn't eat any more.  The place was very busy, and the staff was very attentive."
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,3,"Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side."
89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,5,"The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center. Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food! I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortilla's burrito style. It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65). The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.  If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner."
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"This place still rocks for happy hour which now runs from 5-11pm daily. The Kobe beef burgers are only $2 and the Roka hamachi serrano chili rolls and butterfish tataki are both amazing.  Kirin and sapporo are $5 for a small bottle, $8 for a large."
kUuJ8TDXWz8J2Tnz2sqtuA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,3,"If I could do a 3.5 star review, I would, it's more than ""a-ok"" but I wouldn't say ""yah I'm a fan."" I think the place was only opened a few days, I would also rate it higher if they had it staffed properly. Arrived at lunch, and the staff is in ""training"" mode so it took forever for them to take the two orders ahead of me, and the line behind grew very quickly.  If the service was quick, then I would certainly rate it a four.  Had the ""Bueno Burger"" with jack cheese.  I think this is something else I don't like about the place, you need to add .75 for cheese. I'd prefer if they included cheese with each type of burger. The burger was certainly good, not sure if its as good as Smash Burger, but certainly in the same league (not a comparison to Delux).  Burger was tasty, would certainly go back if I was in the neighbourhood and felt like a burger."
rxjHvIvV_BlzKa8ftRUpGA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"Been to the one on South Beach, and the burgers and fries are just as good here!  My only complaint is I asked for ketchup, and they absolutely drenched the burger! (eeew).  After scraping off a 1/4c of ketchup the burger was fantastic, much, much better than In and Out Burger.  I did remember to order the regular fries (which is enough for a family with small children).   The fries here are the BEST!  Nice to see an alternative to In and Out Burger.  I think the burger and fries at Five Guys Rock!"
IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"Just had an early dinner with the kids tonight (kids eat free from 3-6pm btw).  I had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special, kids had the mac and cheese. All were great meals. The reason to go here is to sit on the patio, it's fantastic!  Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when I'm with the family, I'd just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!"
TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,5,"First time to this restaurant.  I think the ""steak house"" thing was over done, but I'm happy I went here.   I actually split the 8oz petite filet (mignon), it was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The sides come family style, and we shared the sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and spinach, all were very good (and I'm sure loaded with butter!).   Great place, be prepared to valet."
P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"I did catch an episode of Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives and since they did get Matt's Big Breakfast right, I was hoping for the same for this place. I have to say the Bombero burrito rocked! It was so tasteful with the right amount of heat (certainly not 5 alarm, but nice), and other Mexican spices. The kids had two $1.15 taco's each which was the right amount for them (if you're an adult, I would probably get 4). The place is tiny, not the best setup, but the line moved fairly quickly.  I'll certainly be back, it ranks up there with Carolina's as one of my ATF for Mexican in the valley."
W2CzAePJakvARgoQuohbOA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"I eat here a regularly, but realized I've never given them a review! The menu is simple, and if you want a ""fast food"" burger this is the only place to go.  I typically order the double-double w/o the (thousand islands sauce) and onion (this saves not only by breathe, but about 200 calories), and have them add ketchup and mustard. I do have to say the fries are just ok (5 Guys' are much better, but then they are 1400 calories for the large, so I'll eat these ones and be happy my waist is not expanding).  Always lined up during the busy hours, but the line does move fairly quickly.  Just a great burger!"
D3dAx-QW_uuClz4MambeHA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,2,"Been here many times for breakfast, the place is a zoo, but it is sort of a controlled chaos, but tonight it was just a write off. I don't know if they were short staffed, but a quick coffee, turned into 20 minutes, then we were told to go stand in line again (10 deep) at 7pm?!?  Extremely slow service, so if you want a quick coffee in the evening go somewhere else, but they seem to have morning coffee figured out!  Of course the parking is the usual :("
-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"Stopped by for quick dinner at the bar (burger arrived within 10-15 minutes which was great). I wanted to change up the cheese with Manchego instead of American, so I chose the Zinburger with Manchego Cheese & Zinfandel Braised Onions (w/light mayo).  Overall a great burger, I just thought the onions overpowered the cheese. Great staff, very friendly,  and I will certainly come back and try out the Samburger (which I was told is one of the more popular burgers)."
e1i5mbYpFV8rQtfqtVwq3w,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,2,"I've never been here before, so I thought I'd check it out. My usual breakfast places are Matts Big Breakfast, La Grande Orange, and Orange Table which I think are all outstanding.  Had to wait a bit for the coffee pot to arrive, which was surprising since it wasn't that busy.  Coffee was terrible, typical truck stop stuff. Had the special, San Antonio Skillet (potatoes, red bell peppers, green chilies, diced chicken, jack, eggs, sour cream & cilantro. The chicken was tough and chewy, must have been left overs from yesterday.  Food took a long time to arrive, and was not hot. Service was so-so (waitress certainly wasn't enthusiastic), This place is akin to a typical tasteless truck stop breakfast joint, If you want great service, tasty, fresh food go Matt's, La Grande Orange, and Orange Table. This place is around the corner from where I live so it's very convenient, and I'll probably be back to check out one of their Benedict's since many reviewers said they were great."
luI3vBj9ciPBWT2bQ7dXXg,LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg,4,"This was a very good burger. I ordered the 1/3lb Arizona special with a fried egg. They cook their Angus beef burger at a high heat with a crispy finish, and it tasted great!  Also ordered a side of their herb yam fries which were very good.  They also have Tazo iced tea, which was a nice touch. This location is a bit of a pain, since there is no free parking (it is in a parkade, so you can get some shade by parking in there). The burgers are $5.99 with an extra $1.99 for fries or yam fries."
70umoFq_Wa24Nr78UOsilQ,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,3,"Ok service. Hit or miss, sometimes cashier is nice and patient, other times they obviously want you to move along.

Chicken katsu and bbq beef are our faves. Katsu is hit or miss as well. Some batches are soft and golden deep fried, other times crispy and too dark brown.

This is where we go when we don't have time to cook"
O8sBSjxL8hQbA41lKtcoJg,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,1,"Last 2 times here were the worst. Hubby and I bought coffee one morning (one small, one medium). Had to repeat order multiple times at the drive thru, again multiple times at the window. Took a sip a few minutes later and it was a combination of burned, bitter, and sour. He got sick and threw up.

Thought it was a one time off day, came back another afternoon for 2 ice blended drinks (one with whip no boba, another boba no whip). Again, had to repeat order several times at drive through and again at window. Long wait at window and woman immediately closed it leaving the clipboard with me, knocked, no answer, honked, no answer, I finally opened the window myself and THEY were irritated that I was returning THEIR clipboard. Ridiculous."
24Td_CQH1bonWKff1rt2vg,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"Matt's lives up to its expectations. Simple menu, great tasting food. Definitely busy, with fast, super friendly service. I don't know what else you can ask for. Their thick cut bacon is so tasty and filling I could not finish it. That says a lot lol.

Stop by after your morning stroll, bike, or hike , you won't regret it. Btw, their lemonade is made with honey and it's soooooo good."
MXI3o5dhAV5LA-N9WIABOA,0pf5VuzE4_1pwj5NJHG5TQ,5,"We've come here for years and decided to try restaurant week. Little longer wait than usual (2 minutes instead of right away to be seated) because of the dinner rush hour on a long weekend during restaurant week. Boo hoo right?! lol I say it's still great service.

Place was full but our server was awesome! Super friendly and patient. I love to observe if servers treat their customers the same way and he did, super nice to all the groups. Took the time to explain the dessert options. KUDOS!

The food? Always top notch. Cheese crisp, pizza norteña, and of course chips and AMAZING salsa. No room for all the sopapillas and to die for ice cream, but we took it home and kids devoured it.

I'm not a fan of tequila in general but the skinny margarita was strong and frozen melon margarita went really well with our meal. 2 days left for restaurant week. Go have some fun and eat wonderful food."
J3iWlSa27BmyvX2XwJt3Yw,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,1,Well I never even realized that they served pizza and from the reviews I wouldn't order that or the pie. I've had the pot roast and turkey and roasted chicken and it good and the portions are big. The salad bar is OK but they need to allow a second trip or get bigger plates because it's  just a saucer!  Too small for anything!  The bread and honey butter is good. They are over priced and the decor needs to be redone. I'm not sure why I go back because I always feel I've spent to much. Well tried to go in tonight at nine the sign says that they are open till ten the open sign was on and the bitch couldn't run fast enough to turn off the sign so screw them I changed the score to a 1 and went Dennys! :they gave me a five star turkey dinner
yvJqxVTO_qwRGLMtUrqzQw,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,4,This a great place!  The wings and pizza are really good and at a fair price.  It's great for the family and it's close to home and they do a lot of fund raising  for the school.
358UeNvBBE03JKX3u2FtLQ,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,1,It's a great place to eat but they took my favorite sandwich off the menu and I really  don't like the others and the last time I had the salad bar it was very disappointing  so I haven't been back and I used to go a lot
WpzRURptZ2FIxBmJMl4MXA,uU_ol_n14rgh8kuuZ--WSQ,5,Kevin and debra are the best. I've  had the patia bowl and a lot of the Hawaiian ice flavors and iced coffee is my favorite!  I can't go enough I know  they need Sunday off but I'd go if they were open.  My favorite flavor is melon it tastes like honey dew
VLDFjeqpUgWhnVuB_8GuEg,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,5,I stopped in here for Breakfast on a Sunday while waiting for training at the Apple store close by. I sat at the bar and was very impressed with the staff and how helpful and friendly they were. I ordered the Breakfast scramble and added kale it was delicious!! Its great to know that healthy dosent have to mean bad taste. They let me sample a juice drink Kaleaid and will be getting that next time!!
thlAnPN1ApoNxSnok_fcvA,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,5,This place is a great place for a family Breakfast. The atmosphere is down home with carved bears and a lodge look to it. We were seated quickly and the service was great with a friendly waitress.I had the California Omelet and it was ver good and fresh tasting with the avocado on top. My Grandaughter Had the Chicken fried steak and loved it and the portions are large. The prices are very reasonable and I will be definitely going back.
JIETwXSEGIHMNyxZVEnNKQ,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,I really like this place for a quick business healthy lunch!! The service was friendly and quick. I had the chicken protein bowl and was very tasty! We sat at outdoor patio and was nice.
5ZkBnLjuedyk5rRRT6W5cg,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,1,We came here for dinner and had the Shrimp Tempura which was horrible. We sat in the dining section and the atmosphere is very nice but our meal for 18 Dollars was very lacking in quality and flavor!  We told the server and he made no effort to correct the situation so we will not be back!
uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,We went here New years Eve and had a great dinner. The service was excellent and my Lemon scallops and chicken Lettuce wraps were amazing.I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
70WDApYtMcLlrnb1EUW6fg,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,We came here for dinner and we loved the atmosphere. The bartender was nice and made us non alcoholic drinks which were very good I  had the Pomegrante mojito very tasty. We had the beet salad which was good and the lobster tacos which were an appetizer and very good.
4Fylkp8eS2FD9-53eycqLw,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,5,My Grandaughter Haley and I went here for dinner while shopping in the mall. We love the atmosphere and the Sushi. We had the catapillar roll and chopped salads which were huge and delicious.The service was friendly and quick and we always enjoy this place.
dNr7VKRti8dXWE-jzfVBtQ,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,The Perch......... Love the restaurant outdoor patio and listening to the birds.I had a good bacon burger as well. The service was quick and our waiter kept the tea coming.I would recommend for meeting a friend for lunch great place.
iJi7yebXoPVXRyGqqL-v8g,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,This is  great casual wine bar to have a drink and the food is very good  as well!!nThey have outdoor patio area which is nice in cooler weather. The prices are very good here and great for a date night or meeting friends! Its in Old town Scottsdale area which we love. They have couch and chairs to sit in as well inside.
9lH0gzlZB_uXJ1dc9UkF5w,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,This place is fun and has Great Ribs they are tasty and melt off the bone! We had the sweet potato side with marshmallows and it was delicious!! We went here on Black Friday for dinner and it was packed but well worth the 40 min wait! We didn't have reservations so would recommend them next time. Our server Brittany was excellent and kept our drinks refilled without asking her.  We will go back again for sure.
YQFcxE9UXrKc-QuTUu7twQ,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,5,I Love this casual fun place. The lobster tacos are delicious and reasonably priced as well. The service was great and quickly served us on a business lunch!
vdZOiZH9sTseyll44waMuA,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,"Macayos has great Lunch time Specials! I had the Chicken Fajitas which comes with sour creme, guacamole and salsa and only 9.99! They were delicious! They also make very good Magaritas with different specials!The atmosphere is very Rocky Point and we love the decorations very festive!"
QSGerT1enEKlvJnYkwthHQ,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,We love the atmosphere at Claim Jumper its like a Rustic ski Lodge in Colorado but in AZ.The food here is excellent and the portions are large I had the Tri Tips with Coconut Shrimp which was delicious.The Waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed as she had a very large Party seated by us but she was very nice and got us what we needed.My Husband had the Steak and it was great as well.
orMlHMLyHSldYgzfFTaeoA,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,2,We came here for dinner with high expectations and unfortunately  it did not live up to its reputation. The Restaurant had a nice atmosphere however the smoke coming from the kitchen was very irritating to our eyes. The food was Ok but not great.  I had the Scallops and my friend had the Sea bass.. The seafood wontons were Very good.We met Eddie at the door and introduced myself he was barely cordial and didn't come over to the table at all to see how our food was or say hello!
dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,3,"We came here for dinner and were seated outside on the patio which had a great view of the greenbelt at Grayhawk.
The salad was very good was Quinoa with Shrimp  could have had a few more shrimp however it was very good.The server was nice but was a little slow in getting to us."
5diHqpk_JSC4p8tIo4APow,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,We stopped in here for Dinner and were able to get a seat right away on the patio! There are heating lamps out there so was not chilly at all. We had the crab cake appetizer and Loved it was cooked crispy and delicious. I had my favorite salad Which is the Luau Salad and is a huge portion! Haley had the club sandwich and was excellent as well.
MItBn_LArS9O_CvDnIHCVw,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,Verrado grille has amazing fish tacos and we always sit out on the patio with an amazing view of the Golf Course! The service has always been very good and the prices are reasonable especially for being on the Golf course! The inside dining area is very nice as well with a great Bar area. There are Tvs so you can watch sports as well.
v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,I found this place by accident its in a strip mall with AT&T and some time to wait for my phone so went over to eat lunch! I had the Chicken Teryiaki Bowl which was a very large portion and very tasty. The atmosphere is very pleasant and a little on the darker side but we enjoyed it! They have a large selection of cocktails as well.The service was very good and will go back to try the sushi next time.
_ZKsdEkQ5K_CUSBtahjFAA,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,We stopped here for dinner after my car broke down and had it towed. The service was very efficient and friendly and we were seated right away. I had a salad their Mediterranean Chicken which was excellent and very fresh tasting. The bread was served warm which we love.So great place to go for dinner .
ss3Fb0UCBkOZtq7D4c4Q_A,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,5,I went here with a friend for dinner and we had a great time! The food was delicious .I had the Lobster Ravioli and it was perfect! My friend had the Eggplant Parmigana and I tasted hers and it was so good.We shared a salad which worked out perfectly. The atmosphere was very nice and loved the white tablecloths. The service was excellent and our waiter was so attentive which we liked.
dPGs5b0N9MarZjVgQVelGQ,HlHXBTao9GHJv4MwrVrCEQ,4,I love this place its got Morrocan Atmosphere and the food and service is very good! I love the variety of choices with a huge menu! They also have a Skinnylicious Menu if your trying to watch your calories. I had the Luau Salad and it was  Yummy with lots of ingrediants and very fresh tasting! They make excellent cocktails as well ! The passion ice tea is also very good!! They have amazing cheesecake choices as well.
xZhNZb01n9b4e2X7bZdoVQ,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,5,"This place is old school and definitely ligit. The customer service is extremely awesome, the portions are enormous, and the atmosphere is great. The only complaint I might have is that I sometimes I get different things than what I ordered. I say might because I still haven't eaten anything there that I don't love. They also give everyone a run for their money in the ""best salsa in town"" department. Also don't mind the free drinks."
xQtCOQIwrGIiDeHWVHdkBw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,3,"Very health-conscious restaurant. I feel judged by all the residents because it literally resides in their basement but its a great switch up for breakfast if you ever get tired of fried eggs, bacon, and chicken fried steak. Kinda pricey but you pay for the quiet time."
2kro_WXlgmk6nJlkXvN9Qw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,1,"Read Tempe R's review. I felt I created an alter ego like Roger the Alien from Ameican Dad because he literally had the exact same experience as I did. Plus he said he's gone there twice without explanation so maybe we are in fact the same person that keeps changing personas.

Today it was 109 degrees and while I was waiting for my food...I did so outside because it was actually cooler than this muggy mess. How in the hell can they not have air conditioning...in Phoenix, AZ...in the summer? The food is tough to grade because usually I rate it on a scale of good to bad. Since the food had literally no taste, I have trouble attaching a grade to it. The sauces were the only thing I could taste, but they had a hint of bathtub water which didn't really surprise me at all.

Forunately for me I know the food was at least cooked fresh because I was the only one in their for the 30 minutes that my meal was being prepared. I am an aspiring restaurant owner so the sliver lining to this cloud is that one day, maybe I can be a little less terrible at operating a food joint than this place. I almost recommend that everyone try this place, if not for any other reason but the fact that you'll enjoy everything you ever eat again just a little bit more."
thlAnPN1ApoNxSnok_fcvA,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,"I can't believe this place is rated so low. Other than the wait I couldn't ask for more in a breakfast joint. Their chicken fried steak is the size of Texas and really isn't that expensive. I could also eat their biscuits and gravy all day. To me, all breakfast food is pretty much the same but this place is like Denny's on steroids."
GWva6TXiI4ZYejGTx4gqiQ,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,5,My first and only time there may overinflate my opinion but this is one of my favorite places in town because it's also a venue. I got to go see Martin Sexton play live so I showed up a couple hours early. We didn't reserve a table so we got to put our feet up on couches in the lounge and they brought us our food there. I had the fish tacos and thought they were great. There was a Suns game that night so the place was packed for that as well. Very cool place.
flE7Sn2JGs0n3SAtaep6Zw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,2,"This place makes me so irate. There aren't a lot of places in the Phoenix area that have this much potential and squander it without effort. One of the best patios in the city, decent happy hour (although they are very overpriced when it isn't happy hour), boche ball, and live music on Sundays. I say that to say this. Probably the worst customer service in Arizona. It doesn't matter what day of the week or time of day I go. Busy or slow, hot or cold, I can't believe how poorly this place treats it's customers. It's almost like they think it's a privilege to drink there. I try the place about once every couple months and it has become a game with our group of friends to see how long it will take to get service and how many times our waitress will roll her eyes at us. The place is like spaghetti-o's...you forget how much you hate it so you remind yourself a couple times a year."
LtNgP4FqXp5nMFOHErK8cw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,3,"I'm a sushi junkie. I've hit up almost every sushi joint that I've been able to find in Phoenix including the places that identified merely with a yellow sign outside that says...""SUSHI""!

That's why I was so excited to try out Yen. I loved the place the second I walked in. The atmosphere was great, the people were friendly, and the location for me is excellent. Unfortunately for this sushi joint...I really only care about the sushi. That's why one of my favorite places in town is a hole in wall over on Dunlap and 19th Ave. I was so disappointed with the quality of the fish and the actual rolls. We ordered about eight rolls and only finished two of them. You basically have your choice of eel or fried and these are tempura battered rolls I'm talking about. I enjoy light sushi which is the way sushi is supposed to be. A fried tuna roll that weighs over a pound is just too heavy. I'll give it another shot for sure because I really do think it's a nice place but I was shocked that it's Yelp score was as high as it was."
C8D_GU9cDDjbOJfCaGXxDQ,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,5,Um hello? You're telling me that all my friends can run their tabs through the roof on expensive wine and I can order malt liquor in a bag for $1.50? I'm in. Very interesting menu and in a good way. I got the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll and absolutely loved it. The pinnacle though should mean more coming from me because I don't care for sweets. Their dessert menu is out of this world. From caramel creme brule to monkey bread. I love this place and the live music that comes with it.
7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,5,A fantastic lunch spot. I had a chance to show my parents the Kierland area and I chose NoRTH to feed them. It probably helps that it was a beautiful day out but as usual the food was great and the experience was made even better because of our server. I almost never remember a servers name because I doubt any remember mine but Sarah was the best I have ever had at any restaurant. She was helpful with the menu and was able to put up with my dad who usually gives them all a run for their money. She ended up sitting down and chatting for a little bit at our request and had just the best personality. They are lucky to have her there.
VbqtbvvtNOe-YKA61-fSNA,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,5,One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
I1qgWmIEIpnZF-uj6F-aCw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,1,"This place is lucky that Peoria doesn't have the competition that places like Old Town or Westgate have. The service was terrible when we got it, the food (or at least what they felt like bringing us) was awful, and I waited almost an hour for a basketball game to be turned on while the staff and management messed around behind the bar. I love the bar in Old Town and this place had about 10% of the foot traffic and just couldn't keep up. I'd wait until this place shuts down (which it will) and hope that the new place can deliver."
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,There is something to be said about wrapping everything one loves into one little pillow of goodness. I just don't like feeling like I'm in an elevator when I'm not at the bar. Food is very high quality and everything I've ever had is delicious.
oM_iooopkwnS7XnVS5kqlQ,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,"A very solid joint and not a slap in the face to Greek food. I was really impressed with the size and diversity of the menu for such a small kitchen. Lots of hands working quickly allow for the food to come out hot and fresh. I really wanted to give this place a perfect score but I don't eat there often enough to call it a slam dunk. The reason for this is that I can't afford to. A lunch special which includes gyro meat, rice, and salad shouldn't cost over $10. Great place and I'd highly recommend it, but you'll only have a chance of seeing me about twice a month. Sorry to all my fans."
pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,3,"I'm a little blown away that this restaurant is rated so high. The food is good, the prices are fair, and the service was ignorable. It's just your regular run of the mill, hole in the wall chinese joint. No crazy special dishes or anything unexpected. I know it isn't stricly chinese but this place doesn't hold a candle to a Pei-Wei. I got the house lo mein and the Mongolian beef. Not bad but not great."
G9m4TMsKGnWbDavqlg6NXg,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,Nothing crazy here. The Fiji-Oahu on brown rice is what I always get. High quality food with no frills. Wouldn't die if I couldn't ever eat it again but I would be sad  that I would need to find another easy and inexpensive yet reliable meal.
VYuMUCoN6LWTxM80_itq1Q,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,"Besides the fact that I love Ron and his morning show, he knows how to cook up some damn good grub. I had the ribs that were apparently harvested from 14 cows. Everything was high quality and I can't believe how many TV's they had rolling. Wolfleys knows how to do it up."
NUhHkT1wfXsTLxt_tWwVXw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,I hate Thai food and I'm not a huge fan of curry but this place has changed my mind. Very reasonably priced and always a great option at lunch because they handle the traffic very well. Not only am I back on the Thai bandwagon but my favorite dish is the green curry seafood.
d1_Ko1DQ4QyB9BjnCFjVLw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,"I think this place gets the nod because there isn't a whole lot of Italian on that side of town with a family vibe. I compare this place to an Olive Garden without the American""ized"" twist. Happy hour is decent and the sauces for everything are high quality. The shrimp parm is something that I haven't seen very often and it is phenomenal. I also really liked the eggplant ans shrimp appetizer. This is like a once a month place."
gA9hCYY7MYl9oZ3aym5dvw,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,This place was a pleasant surprise. Great selection of rolls and the Heart Attack appetizer may be the best appetizer in town. They have a bunch of new twists on old favorites and their Mexican roll is great. Also very impressed that they use a lot of halibut. Service is alright but they have great sake bomb prices to help you forget.
FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,I may have had a little too much to drink the couple times I ate here but I thought the food was unreal and their presentation is even more impressive. I got the shredded beef enchiladas and it's all I thought about for the next week. Seriously. Like most things in Scottsdale it can get expensive fast but this is one of those few places where I just ignore the price column.
wd-pzPYNehT6QTsc1qr7pA,3OY8rbQ6a6HFvYaFx1oTzA,4,Very unique Mexican joint. I have really fallen in love with the veggie fajitas but even more so the atmosphere. Great drink specials all day long and I've never had to wait for a table even though they can sometimes get packed. I also rate the chips and salsa at all Mexican restaurants and this place is bomb diggity.
SkdDestSlipSj43lYgskxg,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,"Place is always clean, good is always fresh and staff is always friendly.  A little pricey for sandwiches but they do come with a cookie and wifi!"
S6TMBqrsi4PLRFoQFPScjQ,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,4,The argentine sandwich is do good!  So is the big wak!  The fries are also amazing and so are the drink options!  Appetizers were ok though.  The crab puffs and buffalo wings will never see me again... But the entrees have seen me twice and will see me a ton more times!
pt7p4klGicvPZe04mhhVGQ,q3AiAe-AcpDrNsdZf8nCvQ,5,"This has been one of my favorite pizzerias for a while.  It's as close to u can get to jersey pizza.  There are a few other places that are good too, but luckys rocks!"
Gz9SlLqxS6wnxPvgdOQNrA,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Loved the drink special-a Moscow mule made w bourbon, and the good was quite good! I had the smashed chips, they were spicy and amazing-more like sliced potatoes covered in delicious toppings. my friends got the Seoul chicken and thought it was pretty good (although in pretty sure they expected a larger portion haha) I've been looking forward to checking this place out and I'm happy with the atmosphere and bartenders, had a lot of fun here."
OtVNeY6IfUh3CIOCzmfg3A,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Love this place so much! It's such a fun country-style outdoor (and indoor) bar/hangout/food spot. I always get the chili, coleslaw, or beans-which is dirt cheap and still delicious! They always have a guy playing guitar and singing original twangy tunes. They have horseshoes and lots of seating-I've never been here at night but I'm sure it's a good time. Our bartender Mary was a sweetheart and treated us to a sample of some rum chata + fireball which tasted like a shot of cinnamon toast crunch . There are some adorable donkeys and horses on the way in, so drive slowly!"
ALn_0f-Usn3n0a9WBcjhhg,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Hannys is SUCH a great bar for so many reasons. It's an old men's department store-and I can only imagine what is was like back in the day... it has a very classy and trendy atmosphere. There are some creepy things that you should seek out while you are there... go downstairs and checkout the old glass floor elevator... oh and good luck getting lost finding the bathroom... (you'll be okay with being lost). The food is great! Salads are huuuuge portions. The prosciutto pizza is my absolute favorite! The snack plate is great, and the onion strings are also a huge portion that can be shared by a table. Love all the drinks I've had here as well... champagne Bellini and French 75 are my favs :):) they serve food til 1, drinks til 1:30 and  at midnight they serve delish lil martinis..!!"
riM-pBsdqRRVXtAVbLfsxQ,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,3,"Pretty good. Caesar salad was pretty typical, although it did come with two large asiago breadsticks that were yummy, and was huge for only $5.99. Lou's Phoenician was good but the amount of meat was kind of absurd...  I took off more than half of it. 'double bakes bread' does not mean it is baked before served. The bread was cold. The coleslaw was the kind that is slightly sweet. Fries were bomb.com ...wedge style :) Pastries were also reallllly good."
EV1jAj7NFNmNIqOnwZ4Acw,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Copper Blues always has AWESOME music, live or just playing over the speakers, and the food matches! I've had excellent salads and wings, everything is prepared beautifully with seemingly fresh ingredients!! There is plenty of seating And I've never had trouble getting a seat...I love this place!"
jOJaJatp88cqnkVo8D8RJg,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,3,"I'm from New England and Hibachi is way cooler there. The food is better. the act is better ...and funnier. Our guy was so boring! (he was nice though and seemed new) As were the other hibachi chefs in the room. The cut of steak (rib eye) was really fatty. fried rice was awesome, but c'mon...I can easily make that at home. not too impressed. first hibachi place I've ever been to in Phoenix and first time I've truly missed New England."
_WvEXsx2eZ53lTWHlIx9kg,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Awesome happy hour, very well crafted drinks, love the old fashion and Juan is my favorite bar tender!! pork belly sliders are delish as are the shishito peppers. :) great atmosphere."
gSPqD1DR3lzgoaifIhdF_w,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Squid Ink is one of my favorite sushi places for a few reasons. happy hour til 7? YES...it's the only one I ever make it to on time, (even if it is 6:51 when I arrive haha) They have simple options, but also some unique and more complex dishes.
Love the ambience-the bar is outdoor and indoor, so you can sit outside but still feel like you are inside.The artwork is very unique and clearly not purchased at iKea or Target... :)"
6tLL1P8k9drb7MJEVwmRhg,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"I truly enjoyed my visit to Papago brewery. I'm not a big beer fan, but when I moved to AZ I tried the orange blossom at Total Wine and I fell in love with it!! we had never been to the brewery so we finally decided to go today. We ordered orange blossom and I also tried the 'raspberry kombucha', which was a sour beer... both were absolutely delicious! I had a feeling the food would be lame because of the generic options but everything  was veryyy good. My group ordered the Thai chicken pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza and I had the chicken pita. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food!! the chicken and pita were warm and the tzatziki was good (I make a mean tzatziki so I would know!!). They are more than willing to let you try samples before ordering a beer :):) They have darts and a very 'southwest az country' atmosphere... and plenty of beer for sale. You can also bring growlers to have them fill w fresh tap beers. Great place!"
OQggqcQglU-lHY3rY-8Lhw,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"great drinks and bartenders are super friendly and helpful! Gave me a lot of suggestions and told us their favorite dishes. The sandwich PBBLT, was OKAY, but my friend's turkey sandwich and cheeseburger looked really awesome. We got a side of veggies that were delicious. Love the open but ""local"" feel, with an industrial touch :)"
K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"I often feel higher priced Mexican restaurants or overrated (why go expensive when you can go to filibertos?? ;);)) but the mission took mexican food to another level... maybe it was the ginger cilantro margarita and flights of tequila that made it all taste so good... but I was in taco guacamole heaven. We had the mahi, sweet potato, and pork shoulder tacos and the were each extremely unique and delectable. I loooooved the green/verde salsa they served on the side and the two different reds were amazing as well. The waitress suggested the corn and grits as sides and I was somewhat annoyed by her persistence to have us order more more more, but I'm happy we listened! Grits seem to be MIA in most breakfast spots in AZ (east coast I never have a problem finding it) so I was surprised to see it on a dinner menu..and excited to know they were chipotle spiced grits... no words.. so good.
The corn was mouth watering and I realllllly hope it wasn't just soaked in butter, but they tasted awfully creamy-yum yum yummm!
We got the expresso soaked churros for
dessert and I wasn't in love with them-they weren't overly flavorful and looked kind of sad. However, the fried bananas were to die for and came with a peanut butter mousse that made me catch my breath... :):) Back Patio was nice except we were seated next to a huge fan.... bleh. kind of an ambience killer, but the food made up for it."
3qlqzQrwh8hjBltlgFgsJQ,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"maybe I'm biased because I live across the street... but I love this place! always a good deal on delicious margaritas, excellent artwork, great food options (small and large plates) and sweet games and atmosphere."
ml916FaOdF870Jrk0ZQETA,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,3,"This place has basically anything you want-I especially love their challah and pastries. This visit I got the chefs soup of the day, lentil-it was very salty but I still enjoyed it. Warning: it was also scalding hot and I had to wait a while before attempting to eat it (and I still burnt my tongue). The Caesar salad was kinda lame and had too much dressing...should have asked for it on the side. I've never truly enjoyed salad here and hated a sandwich I got one time (it was cold/dry and had wayyyyy too much meat stuffed into it).., but their breakfast omelets, bagels, challah bread, and pastries are kick ass."
-BxWyEIQ6wypT-37MzZizQ,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,4,"Decent salads and sandwiches. They forgot to put dressing on my salad, but the greens and veggies were really fresh and I almost didn't miss the dressing (asked for it on the side). Hummus is okay. Artichoke dip is really unique, and more like a spread (not chunky).. i liked it a lot but definitely not what I expected! Drinks were small pours... eh. I hate how dark it is in here, but I get it-the sun is intense in AZ and as soon as the direct light dissipated they opened up the shades :). They often have live music and it is usually improvisational jazz--bonus points for that!!! and last but not leasts, Love the local and unique artwork featured in the walls :) Happy to live close by to this place-hurray for a 3-7 happy hour!......soo just came back to edit my review just
to mention that they don't take American Express... hmmm... so random! whatevs, had another card anyway."
dIqMQYs6tmowQUygS8sQ6A,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Coffee is very smooth and not too strong! crepes are very good, salads are huge and made with fresh mixed greens :) So happy this place is open so late and all night on weekends!!"
cz5vz-893D3LNH3TMQYR1w,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"I love rebar, there are tons of friendly people here-I almost always make new friends when I come. The drinks are always flowing, and the food is always good! My favorite dishes are the black bean burger, the jicama that comes with the wings, and the grits and shrimp. Definitely a good place for vodka mixers-less options when it comes to wine."
L2p0vO3fsS2LC6hhQo3CzA,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,3,"honestly, I don't think there is anything THaT great about this place. Worlds best waffles? I've made waffles just as good with a waffle maker in a college cafeteria ... they don't do anything special with these waffles either-the only option is to order one plain with a side of bacon.... I've ordered breakfast dishes here before and I'm pretty sure they make it taste good by using a lot of butter and salt. There is nothing else unique about how they cook the food... It is very run of the mill. If you are a fan of bacon, it's pretty damn good. The orange juice is Freshly squeezed and SO delicious, and for that I'll give this place 3 stars..."
-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,4,"Lamb Lettuce wrap 'small plate' was big enough as a meal for me! and it was delicious! Our waiter forgot our appetizer and brought our food first. We said it was unnecessary to bring it at that point, and he brought it anyway but comped us. :)"
aMF8cG445ONPRKBsBYqofg,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Look, this place rocks...but isn't coffee a first and a must? I didn't get it before or with my meal, but maybe 5 min after I got my French toast. The waitress said it was because they were brewing a fresh pot. Eh-I suppose 11:45am is a little late to expect coffee to be ready to go. (She offered me a cup to go as we were paying the bill which made up for it anyway) Food here= perfectly prepared, well thought flavor combinations, and unique ingredients. The french toast made with challah bread is probably the best French toast I've ever had-AND they offer 100% pure maple syrup. I've also had The Bird omelet-and all I can say is WOW. Only complaint is that it was huge and I felt the need to finish every last delicious bite. That being said-you could definitely split any of their omelets or French toast with a willing friend or spouse. My husband got the Benedict with portabella mushrooms and it was equally as delicious. The mushrooms tasted marinated and roasted at the same time and had a slightly sweet/sour taste to pair w the saltiness of the egg and the creaminess of the hollandaise sauce."
3C5Z9homtzkWHouH2BHXYQ,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,"Came here for brunch/lunch this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and priced fairly! I shared the chorizo meat balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the sauce was sweet and savory with leafy bites of cilantro. I often find anything with chorizo to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet sauce pairing. They have the healthy option to get lettuce wraps instead of corn or flour tortillas, and seeing as there was an abundant amount of free chips and salsa, I didn't miss having a tortilla-the lettuce was perfect! The free salsa and chips also came with three smaller and unique tasting salsas/sauces that varied in flavor and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great food and service, the atmosphere was amazing. I loved the high ceilings and stained glass, a huge rustic chandelier and beautiful well kept bathrooms. I will definitely be back!"
N5B7OBTyNGgwU_Y2fwNcyw,t-3YQxj3EunUx_WBUCkPSA,5,I love this place. great food. great ingredients. The Churchill breakfast dish is one of the most delicious plates I've had in all of phoenix. My husband loves the bagels. I will say their macaroons are NOT worth $2... I got a persimmon flavored one and it tasted like butter and sugar. But I've enjoyed every other dessert/pastry I've had here. Happy Hour is fantastic!
83cVpTJNyzv9lJ20vzBgdg,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,5,"We ordered 2 18in cheese pizzas for delivery. They were there in about 30 mins and they were nice and hot. Maybe a little pricey but this is the best pizza I have had in the area so far. Crust is amazing, sauce is just right and cooked to perfection. Closest pizza pie to New York style that I've seen...even better than the ones claiming to be NY style pizza. The order came with plenty of little cups filled with parm cheese and red pepper flakes. This place will defiantly be my go to for pizza!!"
AMM3qOH9DUQzJHm9Q3vHag,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"Looking for a buffet style Chinese place and this came up. It was around $8 per person for lunch. The hot tea was $1 and soda $1.50. They had a pretty broad selection. I felt some of the food was over cooked and sitting for awhile maybe cause it was a bit soggy, like the lo mein, orange chicken and fried rice. I liked the green beans, pot stickers, Korean style noodles and kung pow chicken. They have a salad bar, sushi, lots of fruit, ice cream, desserts, short ribs, shrimp, fish, soups and much more. Price was decent for the amount of food. I'm sure you are bound to find something you like with the selection. Not the best quality, but kind of expect it from an all you can eat buffet. I don't go to buffets much, but I would go back. I haven't been to any other buffets in the area so don't have much else to compare it to."
mUVAMNN7BCQ9HGA9w_7C1g,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,5,"Great atmosphere and excellent food! Cool round building with plenty of outdoor patio spots. It was a bit chill out that afternoon so they turned on the outdoor warmers and it was cozy. Ordered the grass fed Paris burger and it did not disappoint. It was juicy and flavorful with bbq sauce and pickles. Don't pass up the chips. Just the way my mom would make them, thinly slice  up the potato into circles and fry them up nice and crispy. The two sauces that came with the chips were splendid. One order is plenty for two people. Two people $30 for burgers chips and drinks. I will defiantly be back and recommend it if you just want a chill place to relax and grab some good food!!"
NeDqVEiin0q-FxCvOKiERw,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"I ordered from here 3 or 4 times. My family likes NY style pizza and this place is right in our neighborhood. I like that the pizza has fresh basil and good flavored cheese. However, my kids are not a fan. They dont like the sauce, too pastey. The also dont care for the basil.  The crust needs some work as it  has had too many air bubbles and over cooked....way too crunchy. Impossible to eat left overs as the crust hardens like a brick."
tFcmrGLZNEymSnijoTPmqw,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,5,My second time in this month! This time I tried the seasame chicken. It was great! The service was super fast...we were in and out in 30 mins. I couldn't eat everything so I got a to go box. The server was awesome and put another fresh scoop of fried rice in the box for me. Can't beat the prices either. Right by my house so I will for sure be back. Being new to the area I found my go to place for Chinese cuisine.
TT2bNjvnVNFOanDNYnAffQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,5,"Fast service, very clean establishment, and great food. The 4 piece chicken basket was more than enough food for one person. You get chicken strips( super tasty), coleslaw, texas toast and a pile of fries. You can tell the food is made to order, it's hot and fresh. The dipping sauce is to die for. I even used it for my fries. Loved the sweet tea! Price was pretty decent too."
CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,Went here on a Saturday night and we were quickly seated at a small table. The waiter was over with some hot bread topped with rosemary and some dipping oil promptly. The prices were decent around $10-$15 for most meals. We ordered a bottle of wine which was brought in a marble container that kept it cold throughout our meal. I ordered the chicken vegetable alfredo and my husband got the chicken parmesan. Mine was pretty good. They know how to make a good alfredo that doesn't separate.It could have had a bit more parmcheese to it or more flavor. The chicken really had no flavor and I thought would have been grilled. The vegetables were good except the shredded carrots on top were hard and dry. They softened up a bit once I stired them in the hot pasta. My husband's food was wonderful and I wish I ordered that after I had a couple bites. The marinara was great and the crispy chicken was tastey. There was plenty of food that I took half of mine home. Our waiter was fabulous and we will defiantly be back again when we want an Italian meal for a great prices.
qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,1,"The pizza was gross in my opinion. We ordered 2 16in cheese pizzas for carry out at the pick up window. After standing there for a good 8 or 9 mins someone acknowledged us. The pizza was just not good. Nothing about it was appetizing. The middle was soggy and the crust was soo crisp and crunchy it was inedible. My kids didn't even  like it. The sauce was pastey and tasted off. It was overall just bad. We had a whole pie left over from 6 people. The pizza was even worse the next day, and we love cold left over pizza. We ended up just throwing it out. Won't be back to this pizza joint."
YYZGRUCevWS41VZFxp4rrA,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"Went with a family of 5 and paid around $50 for burgers, fries and drinks. You can pick the size and how they prepare the burger. They also have options of chicken, buffalo, turkey and elk. They have 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 lb. You can build your own or get a specialty burger. I got a 1/3 lb med done burger meal. The burger was cooked perfect and tasted good and juicy. The fries were seasoned wedges. The seasoning was good but may have been a little over seasoned. One of my kids didn't like the fries at all. The bun is buttered and grilled and they have a small topping buffet. Over all food was good and wasn't too expensive. The place wasn't busy. We ordered and had our food in about 5 mins.The kids meals were around $5.25 and includes burger, fries, drink and a cookie. We don't live too close but was worth the drive and will be back."
U5P2sECeftfwaHos6h-2kQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,2,"Poor service, and seems like they don't care about quality of food. So, funny thing is we were on our way to Texas Road house, which is right next door, we turned in the wrong parking lot and decided to give it a try cause we had never been to a Lone Star Steakhouse before, but frequented the Road house back in the Midwest.It seemed their prices were a bit higher, but for a good steak well worth it . I ordered a 8oz sirloin with a baked potato and salad, around $14. I also got a margarita. The waitress was prompt, but seemed maybe fairly new cause she didn't know much about the menu. She forgot our waters and came back with half a loaf of bread and forgot again. The bread was not very good and butter was unspreadable. The bread was cold so it just kind of tore apart. One slice each and we were at the end of it. Our salads came and before I could ask for more bread she was gone. My salad was way over dressed. And because it was a vinaigrette I kept coughing at the abundance. I had to chug my magarita cause no waters yet. They called it a chopped salad and I see why. Like litterly every piece of cucumber was a shaving of skin. Its like they peeled the cucumber into my salad. I even had a  lettuce end in my bowl! I wish I would have picked two sides instead of the salad now. margaritas were ok, not to strong but lacking something. I like that they brought out the glass and shaker so you get a little more in your glass. So it was more like one and a half margaritas. But for $9. So on to the meal. Both steaks we asked cooked medium. They were well done with only a little tiny pink in the center. Not a single drop of  juice on my plate or in my mouth. Dry and tough. I don't usually like to complain at a restaurant unless I really need to. I thought about it, but they would probably offer to recook it and we had plans after. Also I know it's hard to eye a steak with out weighing it, but my husband got the 6oz and I got the 8oz, but his looked bigger than mine.   My husband added on shrimp to his. It came with 8 shrimp on two screws on a bit of rice. He shared with me and the rice was good and so were the shrimp. They were cold though, but they do cool fast. I was just so disappointed that a steak house doesn't know how  cook a steak and their so called seasoning sucked. I could tell the waitress knew we were unhappy cause she avoided us like the plague. I think she over heard us talking about how tough they were. She only came back once to quickly grab our plates and said let me take these for you. Never asked how anything was and returned with the bill just setting it and leaving. She was not a good server. Because of the service, food quality and lack of basic cooking skills we will stick to Texas Road house if we want steak at a decent price."
iN3SrF5NO0xSf6umeUws-Q,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,1,"I went here for lunch one afternoon and will never return. The service was terrible and the food is even worse. Upon entering the place was dead, I guess that should have been a clue to leave. Which we almost did cause no one came out for 10 minutes. We actually opened and closed the door a couple times to set off a buzzer to alert the staff. When we were seated the table was sticky and dirty. There was a horrible dirty smell eminating through the whole area. I actually had to cover my nose at certain points cause it was so bad. It smelt like dirty old musty carpet. Our waitress was rude and never checked in with us once after she brought the food. The steak was so dry and tough it was barely edible. The rice and beans were of poor quality. The cheese was rubbery and gross. The guacamole, if you want to call it that, was like a runny mess with no flavor. We waited 10 plus minutes when we were done for our server and then another 10 minutes for the check and there was only one other couple there! I felt like just leaving between the gross food and bad service. I told the server how bad our meal was and she was just expressionless. Oh was all she had to say. I was just hopeing the rest of the day I wasn't going to get sick. NEVER again will I go here!"
QfG4JZvFoFpRbAxU2Fn-UQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,3,"My first time ever at a Ruby Tuesdays. They had a great burger deal going on that I found on Yelp so we opted to go there. It was $6.95 for a few variety of specialty burgers. We were seated right away and I showed the waiter the deal right away and he said yes it was a special they had. The waiter was talkative and related to us with talking about several things. We got our food quickly. The burgers were just ok, nothing extra special or flavorful. Since it was Tuesday the sign outside said kids eat free, so we were even more stoked to try it out. One of my kids ordered the sliders and the other chicken strips. We heard the table next to us who also had two kids comment to the waiter that they were charged for the kids meals. When we got our bill, same thing had to bring it up to the waiter that we thought kids eat free. He aplogized and said he forgot it was Tuesday. I'm sure it's just their standard practice to charge unless the customer complains or notices it. So beware if it's a Tuesday to tell your waiter  and make sure you look at your bill. Not to impressed with the food for the price. Reminded me of a  Friday's or Chili's."
Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,2,"From previous reviews I was expecting a pretty good tastey burger. I went through drive thru and ordered the standard burger with cheese. I had to wait around 5 mins...no big deal, I want fresh food. The burger was huge and had double patties. Everything about it was bland. The burger tasted purely like grease, the lettuce tasted dirty and it was just plain gross. I'm new to the area and really wanted to try out and support local businesses, however this place  will not get my support. My stomach felt queezy the rest of the evening, I'm sure due to the abundance of grease. It dripped from the burger and every bite just seemed like a bland  deep fryer mess. In and out and Culvers have way better burgers for much less. I paid 6.00 for just the burger here and I would pay more if it was a good burger, but the stand just isn't up to my standards. Soo disappointed. Looks like I'm still on the search for a good local burger joint close to my house."
LiBnff-ZuzW16zIvZgFOfQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,5,"I went in for lunch and they were very busy, but I was able to get a table right away. Our server was fast and checked in with us several times. I ordered the steak fajitas and it was excellant. It came with rice and beans and was more than enough food. It was served with a huge flour tortilla shell on the side. It was so big and kind of hard to put all my food into it.  My daughter had the beef tacos and the meat was so good and flavorful!! Overall it was great and not very expensive for the amount of food you get. I will definitely go here again and recommend to everyone!"
NUT7tou1Uvjh0GB4I41Qig,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"I stopped in for lunch one afternoon and found they had some great lunch special. Everything on the menu sounded so good I had trouble deciding what to get. I haven't eaten a lot of Thai dishes, but I found every thing to be easy to understand and delicious sounding. I ended up getting a garlic chicken dish and it was on point. All the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. The vegetables weren't overcooked and still had a crispness to them. The egg roll I got on the side was great. The portion size is large. I would have taken a box to go for the rest of my food, but I was in walking distance to home and didn't want to carry it with me. My server was super busy and she held it all together magnificently.  I will definitely be back to try something else. Their lunch specials are great price, so it is a good time to check them out. They were also super busy the day I was in. People were waiting at the bar for tables to open up. The place is small, but has a modern comfy feel to it. I like it here."
46yg8fJ8fVA1QSaaL7XfOw,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"I ordered takeout for lunch one day and got the marinated charbroiled chicken rice plate. It was pretty good. It came with plenty of rice and a nice crisp salad with a very flavorful dressing. My only complaint is a lot of rice and not much chicken or salad. They also provided a sauce for the sticky rice,but it was still just a lot of rice left after I ate my chicken. I may order again, but for $9 just wish there was more to it. Probably better off actally eating in than a carry out."
-KIdCJnkt5N8rnnmWR5MQg,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,5,"Stopped in today for lunch and ordered an Italian hoagie. I know they are known for the Philly cheesesteak, but I felt like some Italian meats. This sandwich was right on point, filled was lots of delicious deli meats. I godfathered it and added pepperoni. The regular size was so huge I could only eat half. The guy at the register was nice and even remebered us and said here's youse guys order without calling our number when it was ready. The oil and vinegar is what I normally add on my sandwiches and theirs was great. I've ordered Jimmy John's Italian night club when I go there and if you've ever had that Corleon's is 100 times better. Its about the same price and at Corleon's the meats are way better quality, a bigger sandwich and overall tastes way better. The only negative thing I have to say is there was no napkins in the bag and I forgot to grab some when we were waiting. I definitely know where to go next time I'm craving a sandwich and even though the Italian hoagie was great I'm going to try the cheesesteak."
urkODQ1jX0qQzgbqsQjWVQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,5,This is an excellent place for a healthy hearty meal. A half a wrap filled me up and tasted like heaven. I have been here twice and both times got the wrap with chicken and green tea. The electic\ rustic environment are simple and comforting. The food is amazingly great...my husband(who doesn't usually enjoy what he calls health nut food) loved it and want to go back the second time. I will say the parking is bad. We had to drive around for 10 mins to find a spot in the crowed lot both times. The service on the second visit was also a lot slower even though they weren't even busy. We saw three tables who ordered after us get their food first. I really like this place and will for sure be back to try more things on the menu.
Hgy5MrIKrwRJDXnwKaCpbA,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,1,"New to the area and was looking for a good restaurant close by. Decided to try Garcia's after they sent us a coupon in the mail. From the reviews I gathered it would more  American- Mexican food and less authentic. I was ok with that and went to give it a try. Drinks: it was 5:30 and I thought we would get happy hour prices, but to my dismay I guess you have to check out by 6 and not put your order in by 6. Pretty crappy, but whatever. So I ordered what I think was called the coco motion margarita. It was terrible and tasted like a chemical cleaner and not good at all. Plus it was around $12! My husband ordered the ultimate margarita and he said it was ok. The chips,salsa and bean dip were disgusting. The salsa was a runny mess and the thick pastey bean dip was bland. On to the entree- I decided to try what they are known for the Pollo Fundido. It was terrible. There was so much melted gooey fake cheese on it...I just peeled it all off. Under the cheese was a later of sour cream, which didn't really go with the abundance of cheese, not to mention it was hot and runny. The chicken itself was just a shredded once again tasteless mess. The black beans, which I usually enjoy, were  bland and tasted like they were just dumped there from a can. They weren't even hot. My husband ordered  steak fajitas. Which he enjoyed. I tried a bite and it did taste pretty good. He ordered charro beans and they were the same, bland and gross. We will not be returning here. I guess if you decide to try it fajitas are probably your best bet. On a good note the staff was prompt and courtious."
h-Oq86DZfZad9kKXe8m7Lg,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"Decided to give this place a shot for lunch one day. As other reviews had stated there was a sewage type smell upon entering. thank god it went away when I was seated, but not a good impression. my experience gets better though. The waitress was very friendly and even though I couldn't prounouce the menu items she was very nice. I ordered a horchata, which was wonderful. Then I got a one of the chicken tostada. The sandwich was great. Nice tosted bun with lots of flavorful chicken and filling. the salad on the side was a joke though. more of a decoration than edible. A few radishes, a grilled onion, jalapeno and cucumber on top of a bite or two of lettuce. I did eat part of the onion and added the cucumber and lettuce to the tostada, but now I know what to expect next time. The free chips and salsa were so so. the salsa was very runny with little flavor. Overall because I enjoyed the food I will be back. maybe I'll try a different location, the sewage smell kind of frightens me on what's behind the scenes."
70umoFq_Wa24Nr78UOsilQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"I've been here twice now and both times have been great. Lucklily the times I have gone they weren't really busy and I got served right away. I sat in the dinning area with one other couple but a lot of people came to pick up orders when I was there. I ordered the teriyaki chicken plate both times. I LOVE the slaw salad. The dressing on there is the bomb!  I wish you got more salad. The food is average prices and you get a large portion. Both times I had plenty left to take home. I understand a lot of people take out, but I think it would be nice if for dine in there would be real dishes, not Styrofoam containers and plastic forks. Would add quality points. Everything tasted wonderful, including the wontons I got. Better than at a Chinese restaurant!"
JBrBsKpw0bbXK5nlrXVOYQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,3,"If you've never had authentic Italian food then you will probably think it's great. However coming from a person who's grandmother in law is from Italy it was just ok. The sauce was just not flavorful and either was the chicken. I got the chicken parmesan and I honestly make it better at home. The breading had no flavor, a little salt goes a long way. The breading simply slid right off when I cut it. I got three small chicken breast, but it was enough. The spaghetti was just a few bites though, so way more chicken than spaghetti. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs and he only got two of them and they were medium size. The salad was small but ok. The fried zucchini we had as an appetizer was good, but once again lacked any real flavor. Good thing I love zucchini. The waitress was great but it took awhile for our food. It was packed in there and we were sat in a kind of weird corner. The staff had to keep ducking around this small corner wall cause the tables were close together. The staff could barely move from table to table. And it was a little annoying to get asked by every staff member how was everything like every 5 mins. Good service, but come on you keep interrupting and making it less enjoyable. For the price I have been to a couple other places that were way better with bigger portions."
5A_sjC9ULLt4UkDNtr9dkw,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,3,"I didn't really get to experience the real atmosphere of this place, so this is more of a drive thru review. I love to support and going to local business and I like the originality. The reason for the 3 stars is mainly the price point and bakery/snacks in drive tru. So the menu online is not what I encountered there. I ordered a small mocha and it said to pull to the window for food items. My small mocha came to $5, so I was hoping it was going to be worth it. The bakery items sounded interesting like an oreo or nutella  handmade scone. However I wasn't going to spend another $5 to try it. Most other items were $4.50 or more. So I just got the drink. It was filled to the very brim. Yes I want every sweet drop I can get, I did pay $5, but I'm driving so spillage was gonna happen. I was hoping the flavor would be above average, but it really wasn't. I thought the cream or milk ratio was a little high and over took the coffee taste. I will give it another try cause it is my closest local coffee joint. Next time I will just go for a coffee. I would also love to chill inside and order a good meal off the menu it all sounds pretty good and the prices don't seem too expensive, unlike my mocha. I do expect to maybe pay more from a local place, but I just can't see paying $5 for a small too often. Call me cheap, but if it was more delicious I wouldn't have as big an issue."
TtbCOwOpNNzE7fW5CFwyng,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"Went at 8 pm so can't say if the donuts would have been the freshest, but they were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but I'm still new to the area so maybe they are  good for around here. Upon entering there were two people on staff...one gave us a glare like oh great people. She shoved a donut in her mouth and continued whatever she was doing. The second employee walked over and was totally enthusiastic and pleasing. We ordered a dozen variety of donuts. I also got a mocha cappuccino. I was really  disappointed though, I thought it would be a real cappuccino, but it was just a flavored machine. It still tasted decent though. So the donuts were all pretty good...the chocolate Bavarian being my favorite filled. The donuts were light and airy inside and the frosting was just enough."
PRbIMseOwPCCRv5C4SfTDQ,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,1,Was shopping around Tempe Market place and felt a craving for some good food. Low and behold we turn the corner and there is an BBQ plave that looks like it is inside a old train boxcar. We decided that this looked like a great authentic plave to grab a quick bite. The decor is fashioned from old school props wiyh mismatched chairs and tables. Not sure if i liked it or just garage sale junk they found. Our waitress comes over and asked it we ate there before. We say no and she explains the menu to us. She said the meat is slow roast everyday in house and flavorful. Looking at the prices we were a bit shocked especially for a lunch menu. $14 for a pulled pork sandwich and thats the cheapest thing on the menu. It came with 1 side and we both got garlic mashed potatoes.  Overlooked the price figuring the quality meat should be worth it.  Our drinks came in huge mason jars. The sweet tea was ok but I'be had better. The lemonade was way too sweet. Out comes our food about 20 mins later. The sauces were explained to us and i tried a couple of them but the werent good. The meat lacked flavor and was a small portion for the price. My bottom bun was already soggy and i jad to remove it. The potatoes were soo peppery that after one bite i couldnt eat it. I love garlic and this taste was definitely black pepper. I dont like to complain and rarely do but i really wanted a side and this was inedible. Our waitress was no where to be found and when she did come by my husband was almost done with his food.  I asked to have veggie instead cause i couldnt eat the potatoes...no problem she said she would switch it out. My husband then ordered corn bread cause he was done. Out comes his corn bread amd she said the veggies will be out shortly. The  cornbread was dry with really no flavor or sweetness. We finish and here comes the waitress with the veggies. She apologized and said the kitchen forgot about it. I asked for it to go since we were done. She brought it back in a box with our check. It came to almost $70 for a couple low quality soggy sandwiches and small sides. They double charged for the veggies and she said that shouldnt be on there and had to get a manager to take it off. Lowered our bill to about $60 not including tip.  I will not be back. Honestly the cheap chain restaurant Famous Daves is better. The price and quality dont match up here.
lEgKurgXzZaMpExXtvBY7w,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,1,"Low Quality Food with Instant Potatoes!! So I decided to check out my first BBQ joint since moving to Arizona. This place was a sad disappointment. I paid $10 plus to be fed crap on a Styrofoam plate. My Georgia pork was overly salty and no flavor. It was extremely dry and I had to dose it in sauce just to eat it. The sauce wasn't any better, tasting like sugary ketcup. Did I mention it was also barely warm. The potatoes were just add water fake crap. I mean how hard is it to cook a real fricken potato!! The gravy also tasted like it came from a jar. The coleslaw was probably the best item and it was just ok. Even the Texas toast just tasted overly of butter. On a better note the service was great. Our meal was ready by the time we filled our ice tea cups. But that's probably because everything was just sitting there for who knows how long. The place was also completely dead except for one other table. The atmosphere was nice with cool decor and it seemed really clean. However when you serve crap food on Styrofoam you will not get my return business."
tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,2,"Decided to try this place cause it is right down the road. We ordered the dinner combos pepper steak and kung pow chicken. It includes soup, an egg roll or crab puffs, an entree and white rice. My husband wanted fried rice and it was $3.00 extra. We both got the eggflower soup. It was disgusting. Not a fan of any soup at a Chinese restaurant except for wonton soup, which they didn't have. The waitress asked how it was and I said I didn't like it could i try the other option, hot and sour soup. This was by far worse, and maybe I'm biased cause I don't care for egg soup anything, but is this actually exceptible for consumption,  yuck! So the lady comes back and asks how is it? I told her it was bad and I couldn't eat it. She reluctantly took it away and said I take it off. She returned to our table with the egg roll and crab puffs and said she would give us each an egg roll since we didn't like the soup. That was fine and I appreciated her gesture. The crab puffs and egg rolls were over fried and tasted pretty bad, with mostly soggy cabbage on the inside. The food finally arrives and the portions are very nice size.   The food was ok, but not wonderful. My chicken dish had hardly any chicken and mostly veggies. The pepper steak was a little over cooked, but the flavor was good. The place was dead except for a few at the bar and one other table. We sat around waiting for our check for about 15 mins though. Not very good service. There is another place right down the road I enjoyed much better!"
Y_9f9tzVRaXjfT9Fa5_W9A,I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA,4,"Stopped in here opening week and there was a line out the door. It moved fairly fast and it seemed most people were getting to go orders. I noticed the people in the restaurant eating and waiting on their food. A mother with 2 kids was waiting with a number at her table before we arrived and when we left 40 mins later she was still waiting, pacing looking around for an employee- as her two kids tried to keep themselves entertained. The eating area could have defiantly used some attention that day. When we got to the order counter the worker was friendly and asked what we wanted and to let him know if it was a custom taco or seafood cause they would need to start to cook it. We opted for the build your own.
Where I am from in Wisconsin Chipotle doesn't exist. Instead we have a local place very similar called BA Burrito. That stands for Big A** Burrito. Same concept with the fresh local ingredients. So when I came to AZ and knew there was Chipotle I was excited to try it. I've been there three times and just do not care for them. This place Uberrito is much better with fresher looking and tasting items. They have an amazing array of toppings. The only thing I miss about BA Burrito is that they add all your ingredients in to a bowl and mix it up before putting it in the burrito, ensuring that ever bite with taste of goodness. I will be back and hopefully some of the hype with have died down and I won't have to wait 40 minutes."
Sy75QB18Sv-xNp8FoA8KvQ,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,1,"I ventured here about 6 months ago.  The atmosphere was nice, albeit a bit loud. There is plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs inside, though outside it's very tight and the tables are all very high.

The parking was ok, though I always seem to have to valet since I meet my friends right after work across town, and parking is gone around 7pm. I ordered a couple of the appetizers, the chicken lettuce wraps, which was putrid. So bad.  I left it. The other was dumplings, which could've been reheated. I read some pretty bad reviews on here about the food so, I had very low expectations but, a friend of mine likes the spot, so I went along with it.  Truly though, this is one and done for me.  I can't recommend it with so many other nice options in the area."
xZeMt4Vg-P9PTyLgCe5phg,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"A girlfriend and I went here on Saturday night.  There was zero wait time, which was nice.  When you first walk in, there's a bar and big TVs.  The newly expanded restaurant to the left is spacious and warm.  Even the menu is HUGE, full of Greek and Italian options.  The pickiest of people will find something here, guaranteed, and the atmosphere works for everyone from singles to families with kids.

We split the white pizza with chicken and broccoli (yummy) and then split the warm cookie dessert (way yummy).  The staff was fast and friendly and I'm ready to go back :)  Two thumbs up!"
FsCujpVh9Za2Dl5MIYLCxA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,3,"We ate here on a weeknight and it wasn't super busy.  Great service and good food.  I overshot the parking lot and ended up parking in an apartment complex right next door.  No real way to turn around in that spot.

The Mirin Mackerel was very fishy but also very good in terms of the sauce. That said, I didn't finish it.  The Beef Bulgogi was fantastic. I'd come back for that dish alone.

It's a little tight in terms of entry for wheelchairs/powerchairs and there's not a ton of room to park next to booths, but you won't be too much in the way of others. It's doable but didn't seem super spacious."
SAae44V24aD7y_HpgxjhPA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,5,"This new Mesa location (about 2 weeks old as of this writing) is kind of quirky.  It's situated right on the South side of McDowell road across from Red White & Brew.  I often drive by and glance at the folks sitting outside.

We chose the porch as well, which was goodly-sized and equipped with hanging lights and a flat screen TV.  Must be nice at night.  I'm not sure if they have misters but Red White & Brew does.

The interior is spacious and the bar looks comfy with many screens, but it's not a super big bar, just very simple.  The restaurant has a chain feel, but the staff are very friendly and the food options were plentiful.

I ordered the spinach enchilada lunch special (really nice) while my sister got the bean and cheese burro (it's big).  Even the kids' meals seem large in portions.  They offered my nephew a ""kids menu"" but it was really a piece of paper and two crayons (orange and purple - Go Suns!) on which to color.  (The regular menu includes the kids menu).  Mixed drinks looked pricey but beer seemed reasonable.

The food comes fast, tastes great and the restaurant is very comfortable.  This would be a good stop before heading up to the Salt River to do some tubing.  Definitely coming back!"
3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,5,"This place has been around a while, and it's still pretty fantastic.  To find it, just look for the Office Max sign.  You know you've gone too far on Hayden when you've passed the Starbucks in the same strip mall.

Soups at Uncle Sal's are incredible.  I'm not sure what they put in them, but it's a good thing.  If you're in the soup mood, or even if you're not, get the soup!

The bar is not too big so, when it's full, it's really full.  But it's cozy.  (This is a great place to go on a date, though it is kind of spendy.)

The decor is very old fashioned and the tables are a bit tight here and there, but the restaurant can accommodate large groups.  You can also sit outside at some small tables that hug the side of the restaurant.

I highly recommend the Calimari appetizer and the Chicken Marsala. Also, the Cannoli are fantastic.  The shells are authentic; you can really taste the Italian cinnamon :)  I split mine but they are not too big to gobble down yourself.  Love it!"
3dk9XrtorfOJu8yX6BVYRg,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,2,"I had no idea what to expect here so I came in pretty open-minded.  Experienced YC goers dash in and out by the bar as you eventually find your lost little way to the grill.

I got a little grossed out loading semi-frozen, rolled lunch meat into my bowl, smashing it down to allow for more room,and then repeating: load, smash, load, smash...and it didn't even smell all that appetizing, but I followed what the other sheep were doing.  Thank goodness there was tofu.  I ended up actually eating that stuff.  It's a first for me, liking the tofu over the meat.

Next, you add vegetables, pile them high.  (Not too high or they will be all over your tray)  You then look up at a board that has way too much information written on it and try to figure out the sauce-to-pile ratio.  My friend warned me to add more sauce.  I went a bit overboard on the sauce somehow, as the food was swimming in it after it came back from the grill.

You can't really complain when it's all said and done because you were the chef!  If your food didn't taste so great (like mine) then better luck next time, I suppose. (bye bye, $9)  You can get little fried noodles and other snacks to fill you up, and apparently there is a soft serve ice cream bar there, though it was closed for lunch.

I will say, the iced tea there was very nice and if you are a Waponi Wu tribal member like my friend, they do have orange soda from the fountain machine.  The place is roomy and the employees were super friendly.  Just, go easy on the sauce and good luck!"
IW2aHAzU5p60T7xUTLPaIw,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,1,"So, yeah....I actually got food poisoning the last time I ate here.  It's probably my fault, having grabbed a late lunch, ordering soup and sandwich around 3:30pm, which I'm guessing meant the food stayed out quite a while after the lunch rush.  But, um, that'll do it for me!  So if you do go here, go when it's busy. I guess."
TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,5,"I've been going to Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant for 31 years. That's most of my life (at the moment of this review). It has weathered the storms and continues to be my favorite Chinese American eatery in the area. So many items are amazing, but my all-time favorite is their Mongolian Beef, which I picked up yesterday and inhaled. It's amazing. If you're low on iron, order it. Seriously. And their egg drop and hot 'n sour soup are also nice.

The current service is extremely fast, which can be good and bad. If you're going in a group, I recommend sitting at a table rather than the booths. Meals seem to go at a better pace there. Ordering takeaway is also super fast and efficient.

It's a bit tight in terms of wheelchairs/powerchairs, but doable and worth the visit."
1QJFpZxLbHbXSKohWp9uIA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"Everyone's reviews on this place hit the nail on the head.  It's a great eatery that just happens to be located in East Mesa, but it could be located in Scottsdale or Phoenix or Paradise Valley.

If you're hiking, biking, boating or fishing as most East Mesans do, you're sure to pass this place on the NW corner of Power and McDowell, which isn't too far from the Tonto National Forrest and the Salt River.  I swear they pump out heavenly kitchen smells every evening to draw in unsuspecting, hungry drivers.  It works.

The restaurant is right off the street facing South on McDowell.  It's a hop, skip and a jump to a Starbucks (that's 100 paces) and has a nice porch with misters for the summer months.  However, you won't be craving Starbucks afterwards because ""The Brew"" as we call it really pushes the fluids.

CAUTION: If you're bringing someone who has trouble with balance or is disabled or if you are trying to decide which heels to wear when visiting, just note that the floor surface tends to be quite slippery.

I'm not sure in which category the cuisine would be placed, but I'm going to say it's probably predominantly Italian American.  I say that because of the dishes, the pizza selection and sauces used and because this is the one place in Arizona where I would order a Cannoli.

Real, authentic Cannoli are illusive things.  They can either be filled with cream or custard or Riccota or a combo, which I prefer.  There should really be chocolate pieces and Italian cinnamon and maybe a couple Maraschino cherries inside.  The shell should be crisp and have a certain doughy cinnamon flavor, but not overpowering.   I don't go for adding alcohol or bits of dried fruit, but that would be an authentic version as well.

Red, White & Brew offers the custard/creme Cannoli with chocolate chips inside (no cherries except for one on top) and the shell is 100% authentic with the Italian cinnamon flavor.  It's something to split with your date.  It's rich like cheesecake and goes quite well with an after dinner coffee or spirits.  I'd jog in place for an hour for one of these, is all I'm sayin'."
6pQ1DpZo6zygNc3qTch-iA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"I met a friend here around 11am for coffee and a nosh and it was a pretty busy place with comfortable seating. My amigo got a black coffee and some kind of pastry. I got a cinnamon bagel with cream cheese and a cappuccino. The coffee tasted like a strong French roast, but with calm overtones, not too bitter. Once I tossed some Splenda in there, it was smooth sailing.

(The only reason why I've given Press 4 stars vs. 5 is because I'm an Italian roast person, and wasn't really fond of the coffee flavor overall. The coffee preparation was excellent, with a little heart and extra TLC. No complaints there!)

We chatted it up for 3 hours. Both of us brought our iPads but I didn't have any Internet connection. He found one but it's name didn't sound official, so I don't think Press offers free Wi-Fi. I'm not 100% sure but I wouldn't count on it.

The atmosphere was very trendy, North Scottsdale w/a largely Millennial clientele. The staff was friendly and helpful and I'd recommend it if you're in the Scottsdale Quarter and are in need of a strong pick-me-up.

I wouldn't call this place easy on wheelchair/powerchair users. It's pretty tight for seating and ordering, but there are tables and chairs outside in front of the store.  If it's not too hot, you could park there for a spell."
IQLnLQYcTwCjwt_ri9dqhA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"I heard through the grapevine (and Yelp) that Honey Bear's BBQ was a great place to go for authentic BBQ in the area, so I took some friends from Italy to try their first BBQ and we were not disappointed. The amount of meat on the ribs was the most I've ever seen, so they clearly have a great butcher connection. The sauce was not too heavy nor sweet nor spicy, the coleslaw was perfect and the corn was extremely soft. My rib meat was not falling off the bone, but it was tender.  We'll definitely be back!

There's plenty of room for wheelchair/powerchairs, though the gravely parking lot is a bit awkward."
bI9_dtXS9qN0Gmi7YbRm5g,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"Super happy with this location for Mediterranean food.  I had tapped out of what was already in the area, so this relatively newer restaurant was a welcome addition. It's right next to Urgent Care, across from the baseball fields of Fremont Junior High.

It's a family business, displaying all teams Chicago on the walls (So many Chicagoans are moving into Mesa!), and staff has been very friendly service-wise the two times I've visited. Staff look happy, men and women, and the environment is clean and organized.

I highly recommend the gyro with regular fries and baklava. The meat is great, not too dry and not greasy at all.  The Tzatziki sauce is perfect (served on the side).  The bread is fresh and the baklava is yummy. Looking forward to trying more menu options here in the future but, for gyros, this is where to go.

In the restaurant as well as where you wait, there's plenty of room for wheelchairs and power chairs."
16d3BlncEyCTzb0GxXrBXQ,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,5,"The best gyros I've had in a long while, the meat is crisp and juicy, greens are fresh and their tzatziki sauce is really nicely seasoned, super yummy.  The bread is doughy and tasty as well, and they make a nice baklava too. Super friendly service, convenient location, tucked inconspicuously near the AZ Humane Society Thrift Store in the Fiesta Mall district. Plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs. Definitely coming back and soon!"
-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"This restaurant is hiding on the 2nd floor, closer to the canal than Stetson Street. My GPS got fooled. Fortunately, my friends were smarter & left me some breadcrumbs to find them there.

Speaking of bread, it's ok but the garlic aioli sauce is more than ok. Do ask for it. It goes well with...the bread ;)

I got the entree, sole dipped in egg. Amen. That's all I can say. Always nervous ordering seafood in Arizona. This was great. Very fresh.

My friends did the tapas thing. I tried their croquettes de Jamon. They were good but we didn't find any Jamon in there.

The waiter was from Spain. What a refreshing change of pace. I speak a little Spanish & had a blast trying to converse.

There was a bit of live flamenco, but my eye was more distracted by the flat screen showing the NBA Finals :D

Bring some friends, try a bunch of stuff. I think you'll enjoy it."
kLWWS2n4X8J8Szy_xVTPHQ,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,3,"I've driven past a thousand times but just found this place on Yelp when hunting for an alternative spot to buy gyros.

I came in before another lady with a large order, but the two-person crew actually worked on both of our orders together and we left at the same time (i.e. I waited for her many hot dogs to be put together.)  Normally, I pick up lunch in the middle of a work day when I'm kind of in a hurry so, if you do come here, even if no one else is around or before you, please be prepared to wait a little longer than usual for your order.

The gyro was good. The meat was a bit dry but not greasy, and the pita was both crisp and soft. I liked it but I didn't love it. The tzatziki sauce was nice, with a hint of cucumber. It's creamier and firmer than I've had before but very nice. The fries were dusted with salt and maybe a hint of flavoring, very nice, also not too greasy.

I would say it's pricey for what it is, but I don't mind paying a family business a bit more for them to keep going strong.

The restaurant is a tight fit for wheelchair/power chair users. You will not have room to comfortably eat here, as the tables are booth like in a row. I'd recommend ordering to go."
iBihgoxc6Ot7m2D4D3z0QA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,3,"We came on a busy Friday night and the service just couldn't quite keep up.  But, that said, everyone enjoyed their food.  I thought the appetizer and meal servings during our dinner were smaller quantities than anticipated.  I've had their burgers before and wasn't wow'd so I went veggie this time and got the Quinoa & Black Bean Veggie Burger, which was good, it just came apart.  But it was yummy.  And even though it's a veggie option, they still killed it with a knife presented directly in the middle :)

The idea of outdoor seating is nice but I think indoors is better. Less view of traffic and headlights.

Good amount of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs."
mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,3,"Not a Deli person, I found myself eating here with some very Deli people, who wolfed down some good looking sandwiches. They seemed more than satisfied. The food is authentic.

I opted for a burger & fries & a brownie. Yum-o on the brownie. The burger was nice & the service was excellent. Easy access if you're in a wheelchair/power chair."
C6MG3vrloHF8h9PPvZNiJA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,3,"I met a friend here a couple months ago and got the Chicken Pad See Ew and it was ok, the sauce was kind of odd.  The service was fantastic, though, really nice and very attentive. My friend got the Chicken Pad Thai, a classic, and she hardly touched it. Something about an issue with that sauce.

I'm definitely going back, if for nothing else than the Thai Tea, but I'll have to try other dishes, even though it seems like these are the big two Thai food dishes that you'd hope would taste kind of standard and fresh at any Thai restaurant.

Just enough space for power chairs/wheelchairs, but not very roomy at all."
S5o2kplwZtc9XWdktq_GcQ,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,5,"Three of us girls rolled out late on Sunday morning and enjoyed the practically empty Cheesecake Factory by the Superstition Springs Mall out in East Mesa.  We sat by the bar in cozy wicker chairs and ordered brunch.

I had the Energy Breakfast, which was way more food than I could stomach, but very light and healthy (egg whites, tomatoes, chicken breast (2) and English muffins...erp).  My friends ordered French Toast and Eggs Benedict and they were all smiles.

Accompanying our meal were Chai Tea Lattes (scrumptious, they liberally added cinnamon) and a Vanilla Honey Latte.  Both came frothed.  (Tip: Don't breathe in when you drink the froth)

Our waiter was handsome, helpful, earnest (we pressed him on if we should splurge and get the Monte Cristo) and even pronounced my last name correctly, which NEVER happens.  (big tip time)

Everyone knows what to expect after going to The Cheesecake Factory, but I think their breakfast, which is available until 2pm, is a great way to start the day....or afternoon."
tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"Crispy honey shrimp, 1,000 calories plus, but darn good eatin'.

If you want to make your tastebuds happy, you can here.  But any main dish worth chowing down on will dig into your calorie purse big time.  And don't get me started on desserts:  The rich and crazy chocolate and raspberry layered cake is nearly 3,000 calories.  The mini size is over 300 calories.  That's just a snack for someone like olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, but for the rest of us that spells diabetic coma. (Tip: Don't broadcast the calorie count of every single menu item.  Most people don't really want to know.)

This location has a boomerang-like or half-circle set-up.  I liked it.  The bar was loud on a Friday night, but not crowded.  You're not going to hear your cell phone at all there.

Drink-wise, I highly recommend the organic green tea, served hot.  That stuff is quality.  Also, their mojitos are fantastic: lots of lemon and mint, very refreshing and not too sweet.

There were 6 of us at a huge table and we ate and gabbed for so long that the waiter did a cute little sit down and said hi and then got up quickly and left.  I thought he was being flirty and getting off of his feet for a second, but the more wise and knowing in our group realized he was politely saying ""beat it, we need to feed others."" (Tip: it's called a lazy susan.  If you have a big group at a round table, you're gonna' see one of these.  We had zero lazy susan skills all night.  I think if you're going to drink, just be prepared to eat someone else's dish, or get dizzy trying to get to yours.)

I'm not a big fan of chains when dining in my home town.  I think chains can make the big, bad scary world of restaurants a teeny more comfy when traveling when you're feeling less adventurous.  But compared to Tempe's PF Chang's location, this one's better and you really can enjoy your meal here.  It's nice to see cars parked there that you will never be able to afford, or take a stroll past tempting shops nearby.

Note: If you are wheelchair bound or in a power chair, the table height at this location is high enough for you to eat like everyone else when seated at the table.  You don't have to be too far from your plate or too high up.  It's just right."
E4JyAzB5_2quptwtemyhYA,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,5,"I drove forever and a day to get here with the promise that it was an excellent place for brunch. It was! The food and service were fantastic and the experience was well worth the drive. The surprisingly young group of management running the restaurant are so hospitable and caring; it's definitely a diamond in the rough.

My friend ordered a hearty looking breakfast sandwich special with fried potatoes and pico de gallo. She inhaled it happily. I chose the breakfast special: Short stack - (2) fluffy, lightly lemon-tasting pancakes, 2 pork sausages and 2 poached eggs. Everything was excellent, especially the pancakes and sausages. The staff was very attentive down to the detail on exactly how I liked my eggs prepared.

By the time I realized I should take a photo for Yelp, I looked down at a completely empty plate. Oops :)

The location is very close to the 51 freeway on the SE corner of 32nd Street and Thunderbird in an unassuming strip mall.

The venue is powerchair/wheelchair accessible, including spacious restrooms.

Two thumbs up!"
R-Me-p4Rbb0q-2pjSzyDbw,u9N5_-N4oRz-UhwCFNbp-Q,4,"A friend of mine invited me out for brunch to Jim's Coney Island Cafe.  I must have passed it a million times, but never really noticed.  The location is on the West side of Scottsdale road, just north of the freeway.  It's tucked beside an apartment complex and is a freestanding little restaurant.

You seat yourself with choices ranging from seats at the bar to cozy two-seater booths to your more typical larger booths.  There is even room in the back for private parties.  Once I found an open booth, I was quickly greeted and supplied with beverages.

We stopped in for brunch at about 10am on a Monday holiday, but judging by the depth of the menu, you can pretty much enjoy some good items at reasonable prices for lunch and dinner as well.

The cuisine offers Mexican, Greek and Polish influences.  I had to get the Greek Omelette.  It was a three egg omelette with large mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, gyro meat and crumbled feta cheese.  Side options vary from something healthy like cottage cheese to skillet cooked potatoes (""house fries""), which were nice.  My eggs were not quite warm enough for my taste, which I think had to do with the fact that we waited quite some time for the food to arrive.  The service was super friendly but not super fast, so I would come to this establishment when you have some time to kill.

Nice ambiance, thumbs up :)"

Gz9SlLqxS6wnxPvgdOQNrA,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,4,"Upscale atmosphere, fancy clothes, professional bartenders and true mixology, classy place... am I really in CenPho?  Maybe the district is growing up.

We went in and found a long and detailed menu, complete with graphs depicting where each drink lands on a scale so you can decide how adventurous you want to be.  But we didn't even use it, the bartender just asked us what flavors and liquors we liked, and he made something custom for us.  We also got the dessert in a cup, and it was amazing.

The bill did come to like $80 for 2 drinks each for 2 people, and 1 dessert.  So prepare yourself.  Also you likely need ""reservations"" to get in, since this place is busy.  I guess we looked the part since they just let us in anyhow, so maybe that is ""flexible"".

Yelp Review of the Day on the menu board is a nice and hilarious touch."
7cLLZOdfsXqg1zqiK0HMIA,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,2,"As many others have said, pretty substandard service.

Food was bland all around. They do target the retired crowd who probably aren't used to things like flavor and spice.

Your grandma from the midwest is in town? The one who says ""oh dear these bell peppers are too spicy"" - take her to Chart House.

Otherwise, there are many sophisticated kitchens with better service to be had. The chocolate cake appeared to be store-bought chocolate ice cream in the shape of a cake. That doesn't cut it in Scottsdale's culinary scene.

We generally had to wait almost an hour between courses.  I can excuse that for the entree course (which came to me at room temp), but we ordered the restaurant week menu.  Appetizers were cold dishes and likely pre-plated.  Why did it take an hour to get them out of the fridge?  The dining room wasn't exactly slammed.  The manager did notice that our table had stacks of dishes languishing on it, and grabbed a cook to help him clear it, so kudos there.

Waiter brought a large glass bottle of water and poured it for our table, when it ran out he was right back to start pouring another bottle.  Many modern restaurants commonly leave a glass carafe of water at your table these days - only Chart House charges you $7 per carafe.  At the end of the night we had at least $21 in charges for water just on me and my wife's tab.  Well, the slow service had us there for 3.5 hours, we did drink a lot of water.  It wasn't made clear to us that this was ""fancy water"", which we would of course have turned down for tap water.  We chose not to argue the point.  We had to work the next day and we no idea how long it would take to resolve. We decided to pay the $21 penalty to be able to leave quickly.

Things they did wrong -
Slow service.
Bland food / lazy menu.
Snuck in for-fee water.
Happy hour only in the bar.
Entree not hot.
Poor value for the cost - meal for two was around $140, one can find better food and service at restaurants 1/2 the price.
And we had the restaurant week menu, which should have been their ""best first impression"" offered at a discount.


Not getting one star because there were a few places they excelled.


Things they did right -
Cocktails inspired and unique.
Creme brulee was excellent, well-rounded and complex.
Restroom was clean.
Great views of the lake.
Kitchen ran out of ""restaurant week"" sized dessert, brought us a full size dessert.

They have ducks outside and free bread inside.  If you get too bored between courses, you could always take advantage of those facts to pass the time."
E_eIph8IT10Uo06ZdWwoUw,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,3,"Tons of beer if that's your thing... full bar too.  No cocktail menu to speak of, and only a few food items on the menu.  Felt like kind of a basic, no frills place, which can be a good thing sometimes.

We were there in late December at night and all the doors were open with no heating... not sure why that was, but wear a coat if you're going to hang out indoors here in the cooler months.  Freezing cold, tried using the candles on the table to keep warm, not so efficient... so we only stayed for one drink and bounced."
tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"We went to dinner on Saturday night and had a 35 minute wait. Not bad for Oregano's.

The Good:
Roasted Garlic Chicken Lasagna - 5 Stars. Freaking phenomenal. I personally don't care for lasagna, but tried it after my husband started moaning over it. The best lasagna I've ever tried... I'll be getting this next time.

The Antipasto Thing - 5 Stars. Delicious. The Jr size is more than enough for two people to share.

Old-Fashioned Sangria - 4 Stars. Very tasty...

The Service - 5 Stars. Excellent... Jordan was a fabulous server. See more below on service.

The Bad:
Mardi Gras Chicken Melt - 1 Star. Nowhere in the description of this sandwich does it say that the chicken will be cold (not cool, COLD). When everything is steaming hot, the texture of cold chicken is unappealing and borderline inedible. I ate less than 1/4 of this sandwich before giving up. Plus, the description states it is ""cajun"" chicken. The chicken literally tasted like it had come out of a can - no flavoring.

Jordan (awesome server) asked if I wanted it boxed and I said no, thanks. I wasn't going to say anything, but she pressed and I gave in. She spoke with her manager and offered to bring me something else for dinner. I told her it was ok, I didn't need anything else. She insisted so I ended up taking a Veggie Wedgie home.

I would have given this visit four stars, but Jordan going above and beyond bumped the experience up to five stars.

We'll be back!"
EV1jAj7NFNmNIqOnwZ4Acw,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"After reading the reviews about this bar/restaurant, my husband (G.) and I were a little wary, but saw little other choice since we were going to StandUp Live with a large group of people who were meeting at Copper Blues.

I am happy to say that we had a great experience at Copper Blues and that we have no complaints. Well, their prices are a little high, but we expected this based on the location. That is a minor quibble.

Although they were moderately busy when we arrived (4:30pm on a Friday), we were seated promptly in the bar area. It was very loud since there was a two-man band playing, but they were good so it wasn't a big deal.

The beer selection was good... a little bit of everything. G. and I are both beer lovers so this made us happy campers.

I ordered the macaroni and cheese with bacon appetizer and G. ordered the hot wings. The macaroni and cheese was tasty... not the best I've ever had, but it was good and filling. My husband liked the wings although he said they weren't that hot. I tried one and I thought it was plenty hot, but I am a bit of a wuss so there you go.

Our server was excellent. She visited our table often enough to make sure we had drinks and didn't need anything, but not enough to be a bother. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu.

If we didn't live so far away, we'd probably visit again soon. If we go to StandUp Live again, we'll definitely stop in for beers and dinner beforehand."
3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"I work around the corner from Uncle Sal's and was introduced to this gem by my boss. Since that fateful first encounter, I have been enjoying lunch here every other month or so for over three years. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed. The service in the bar (where I usually eat) is excellent... my cup is never less than half-full and the food comes out within 15-20 minutes of ordering.

What I've had here:
- Grilled Italian Sausage with Green & Red Bell Peppers (only available in the bar) - delicious! This is a lot of food for only $7.95.
- Chicken Marsala (entree) - one of my favorites! This is a full chicken breast in an abundance of Marsala with loads of tender mushrooms.
- Chicken Francese (sandwich and entree) - PERFECTION. This is my all time favorite at Uncle Sal's. Chicken breast with a white wine and lemon sauce.
- Chicken Parmigiana - Tasty.
- Eggplant Parmigiana (sandwich) - Yummy for those days when I don't want meat. Get this with the sweet potato fries!

I've also had one of their pizzas. Pretty good, but I've never ordered it again because they have so many other things that are better.

I highly recommend Uncle Sal's!

Side Note: To be fair, I took my husband here once and he wasn't blown away. There might be something wrong with him though... :)"
lsKv0IDdj3c6Y8bT6taxSA,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"My best friend introduced me to Lucky Lou's for lunch about two months ago and I've been back three times since then. The atmosphere is that of a bar, but don't let this discourage you from checking it out.

The service has always been spot-on. They are prompt with getting the orders in and with refills.

I've had a variety of their lunch sandwiches:
California Chicken Wrap (twice; 4 Stars) - very tasty and generous with the chicken.
Turkey BLT (4 Stars) - this is huge and I couldn't finish it, but it was yummy.
Chicken Caesar Wrap (3 Stars) - too much sauce and lettuce, but otherwise good.

Their fries! OM Goodness, their fries! The seasoning that they use on their fries is delicious. It reminds me of Red Robin's seasoning and who knows, it might be the same, but I don't care, it is just SO good.

The prices on their lunch sandwiches are very reasonable - right around $7 which includes a side.

I've never been here at a time when I wanted to have a beer so I don't know about their selection, but I look forward to checking that out sometime.

They have a vast menu at reasonable prices which makes me prefer them over some of the other restaurants in the area."
aw0H9O1yysoHB0JanT0Ubw,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"I went to Chicago Gyros with my husband, brother, and sister tonight based solely on the reviews on Yelp. I am happy to say that this place rocks!

One awesome thing is that they offer ""normal food"" (sister's description) such as burgers, hot dogs, fish and chips, and chicken strips as well as Mediterranean food.

We got the Vegetarian Platter (appetizer) so the youngins could try something Mediterranean without committing to a full meal that they were convinced they wouldn't like. The Platter includes two different types of hummus, pita bread, dolmas, and falafel. Everyone tried the hummus and agreed it was ""ok"" or ""I've had better"" (me)... the pita bread was loved by all. The dolmas were scorned by the kids since they were - gasp! - green and slimy-looking. The husband and I tried them - we didn't love them, but we would try them again. The falafel were determined to be just okay - they were a little on the greasy side and I'm not sure if that is how they are supposed to be...?

Husband and I got the Chicago Gyros. This is were this restaurant goes from two stars (more on that below) to four and a half stars. The meat was perfectly seasoned, moist, the pita was the perfect texture, and the sauce was delicious. Perfection when eaten with the meat and pita. I have eaten a LOT of gyros and this is one the best Tzatziki sauce I've ever had.

The service. The guy behind the counter earned the nickname from my group of Mr. No Personality / Mr. No Smile. Seriously, he NEVER smiled. I cracked jokes, I complimented the gyros, I didn't even get a twitch of a smile or acknowledgment that I had spoken. The cook, on the other hand, smiled and thanked me while Mr. NP/NS continued to ignore me. Whatever - the perfection that is their gyro is almost enough to make up for him... he keeps them from a perfect score, so the final score is: 4-1/2 stars."
gONNfEoNaRLNtgaAcxwsLQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"Flanny's isn't close to our home, but we are willing to make the drive when they put on beer events. We've been there twice now and both times, we ate and tried beers from their excellent selection of beers on tap.

The food is better than your standard bar. We've had the chicken quesadilla, burgers, and my personal favorite, the buffalo chicken wrap. Finally a place that uses a hot Buffalo chicken sauce instead of this wimpy stuff masquerading as buffalo sauce at other joints. It was delicious!

The service is usually great unless they are packed. In which case you may have to wait to see your server or get your own menus.

We'll be back!"
6tLL1P8k9drb7MJEVwmRhg,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"The Good: The beer selection is excellent! Personally, I enjoy Elsie's Irish Cream Milk Stout and the Orange Blossom. They have a good selection of craft breweries from out of state too.

The Bad: The Customer Service is seriously bad. We have gone to Papago countless times and have yet to EVER have good service. We've even tried sitting at the bar to see if that will help... Nope. It takes talent to ignore people who are right in front of you.

The beer outweighs the bad service which is why they get 4 stars and we continue to go to Papago."
UBQRhqRMW4Sk7kSZvZ1iAQ,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"I'm forced to admit that I'm a regular at Essence.

That says something, since I don't like to be considered a regular ANYWHERE ... there are just too many great places out there I haven't been to yet!  But Essence keeps drawing me back.  Their menu isn't enormous, and mostly features sandwiches and salads:  typical bistro fare, with French/Greek influences.

But the quality you'll find there is unsurpassed.  They use very few ingredients that aren't organic and local.  Their beef is free range, and tastes like it.  The skill of the chefs shows in everything, right down to the side salads, which are barely misted with homemade vinaigrette dressing to enhance, but not hide, the flavor of the organic greens.  And the desserts ... don't even get me started on the desserts.  I've ordered all of them more than once.  The macaroons are light, fresh, smooth, and sweet, and are so tasty they might make you black out for a minute.

Somehow, despite the quality, the place is affordable; nothing on the menu is over $10.

A warning:  if you go for lunch during the week, go early.  The place fills up fast, and their daily specials (which are all phenomenal) are often sold out before noon."
kO1-ZswCgQak2beKUMaYRw,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"It's not often you find an authentic Japanese hole-in-the-wall joint. Well, not in Phoenix anyway. Nagasaki definitely counts.

It's just ... fantastic. Their sushi is fresh and delicious and inexpensive, but the selection is limited. They have sukiyaki and excellent miso and udon and those little multicolored pickles. Everything is tasty.

It's not always easy to spot, especially at night, because they don't seem to like lighting up their sign. But if the lights are on inside, it's safe to assume they'll feed you.

One more thing: since they're really quite authentic, they don't really have any dessert on the menu. Don't go there expecting to order a tempura-fried banana or green tea ice cream."
AqYLbchnIxVSBdUJuLVdrA,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,4,"Tempe is incredibly lucky to have so many great Thai restaurants.  There are at least four within a mile or so of ASU.  Most are popular enough that you'll be waiting for a table on any given weekend around 7pm.

For some reason, Tempe's first Thai restaurant (according to the comment on their menu) is tucked away in an unpopular strip mall off the 101 next to a DES office.  My girlfriend and I stopped in without calling first on a Friday night and had the place almost to ourselves.  The tom ka gai was nicely spiced with lemongrass and lime leaves, and didn't have too much coconut milk.  Our green curry was spicy and had lots of fresh Thai basil.  For dessert we had a frighteningly tasty coconut custard dish with sweet sticky rice.

Siamese Cat isn't as posh, trendy, or expensive as a lot of other Thai places, but it's a great alternative to the crowds if you're looking for an exotic, romantic weekend dinner."
ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"I get a craving to come here about every other week.  Their food is consistently fantastic, even with their large, diverse menu.  The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!

Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.  Parking at the Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale locations is tight (as the Phoenix area tries to grow up and become a real city, this is inevitable, and will be more and more common), but it's better at the Mesa and Gilbert spots.  And since the food is fresh, you naturally have to wait longer for food that takes longer to prepare, such as the wings or the deep dish pizzas.

Okay, you've been warned.  Believe me (and I'm one of Earth's least patient people), the wait will be worth it."
2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,4,"I managed to beat  the lunchtime crush of people heading to Haji Baba by about ten minutes.  I had already placed my order.  My plate of hummus and my yogurt soda was just arriving when I noticed the place was now packed, and a line of people was waiting for a table.

Two obviously out-of-town ladies sat at the table nearest me.  They used loud, awed, slightly bemused voices that hinted they were from the Midwest and had never been ""out West"" before.

""... couldn't BELIEVE the TRAFFIC!"" one was saying as they sat down.  ""We waited fifteen minutes on the street before we could even turn into the campus!""  ASU was having their Student Load-In week; traffic was hellish anywhere near the university.
""It was no better when we unloaded Nicole's things,"" the other woman said.  ""We were right in the middle of carrying in everything, and a security guard stopped us an told us we couldn't --""
""Would you like something to drink?"" the waiter asked, surprising them both.
They gave him their orders, after asking ""what kind of pop"" they had.  Definitely Midwestern.  The waiter walked away, and they continued staring at the menus as they assumed looks of deep confusion.
""What is ... shum ... shoe-marmy?""
""Shoe-arma?  Shuh, warma?""
""What IS that?""
""I have no idea.  But it comes in a sandwich.""
""Like, on bread?""
""It says on a pita.""
""Oh .... But isn't a pita a cracker?""
""What about ... baba gub .... Bana gaboosh?""
""Where?""  The friend pointed at the other's menu.  ""Oh my.  Bagga boo ... goosh?  Excuse me?  Sir?""  I realized she was talking to me.  ""Do you know what this is?""  She pointed at her menu.
""Baba gannouj,"" I said.  I kind of enjoyed the look of fear that crossed their faces, as though I were uttering a phrase that would summon a lesser demon.  ""It's eggplant dip, kind of lemony.  Kind of like hummus.  You dip pita into it.  It's great.""  As I spoke, I watched her eyes grow huge as she saw my glass of fizzy, thick white yogurt soda.
""I've never even HEARD of that!"" the other woman said.  ""What's this fluffoofal?""
""Felafel,"" I said, and the fact that I avoided laughing then should earn me some kind of award.  ""They're fantastic here, lots of great spices ... have you had felafal before?""
They hadn't, of course, and I was at a loss to explain it.  I decided the shwarma or the gyros were probably too ""exotic,"" so I recommended the chicken kebab pitas.  My koobideh plate arrived then, prompting another couple of baffled, wide-eyed stares.  I told them to be sure and get a couple pieces of baklava for dessert, since it's better, fresher, and half the price of anywhere else nearby.  They agreed, but I got the impression it was more due to the fact that they had heard of baklava before than my recommendation.

Judging by the yummy noises coming from their table as they ate, they enjoyed their kebabs.

I had to withhold a star, as much as I love Haji Baba, because it does not have the best shwarma I've found.  It's very, very good ... but not the best."

Jasmine Tokyo is not like those buffets.

I was completely unprepared for how good it was. I made the mistake of going there for a work lunch. I should have gone on a day when I was free to spend the day lying in anguish on the couch, wondering why, WHY, did I have to go back for the fifth and sixth plate of food? But no. I filled up my first plate with various salads ... and was shocked to find they were all delicious. Fresh, crisp, tasty ... just amazing. I went back, and got some sushi. Their sushi variety was far better than it needed to be. Again: fresh and delicious. I went back again, this time for some of the stir-fried options. And a pork bun. And some miso soup. And some chicken skewers. And every single thing was delicious. I didn't know what to do. I thought if I found just ONE thing that was sub-par, I could quit eating. But no. It was all incredible. Something like 7,000 calories later, I just gave up. I staggered, slowly, out the door, feeling disappointed that there were so many different things I didn't get to try.

I'm not sure why, since I get boba so infrequently it's not like I remember the characteristics of the last one I had. But it's best to start with the basics I guess. And it's a good thing, or it would have taken me another three hours to decide what to get. Their menu is just daunting. There are literally more than a hundred flavors on their chalkboard menu. And there are options besides boba too.

Oh, and the place is clean and decorated with cool lighting, and this milk tea boba is really damn tasty. 9/10, would suck chewy lumps through oversized straw again."

You also know they have coffee, since ""Coffee"" is in their name, and it's a café.  This review isn't about that either.

This is about the quiche.

Actually, it's about all the pastries, since they're all made by the same unfathomably talented pastry chef, but it's the quiche that, every time I have it, makes me wonder, ""If this is quiche, what's that stuff I ate every other time I ordered quiche?""  It's light. Just ... just so, so light, and fluffy. The crust is crispy and light and buttery. And it costs far less than inferior quiche at other places (about $4, I think).

But the five stars I gave it aren't just for the quiche, or the rest of the amazing pastries.  This place just does everything right: the location is in a beautiful, historic location; they have a terrific selection of loose-leaf tea; the atmosphere is cool, with worn concrete floors, a high ceiling, and vintage furniture; the staff is friendly, and acts like a family; and a vintage Bang & Olufsen stereo playing music that is far too cool for me to identify it.

To her credit, she was doing the best she could, but despite there being just one other table of people, she couldn't handle it. I knew we were in trouble when the other table mentioned that they had been waiting for their food for 45 minutes.

The details aren't really necessary, so I'll summarize: the food was okay. Not great. And it took far too long to arrive. They didn't have what we ordered, and didn't know that until most of the other food was ready, but the poor girl did what she could, and refunded me the my money for what she couldn't.

FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"Postino is exactly what I think of when I imagine a wine bar:  cozy, trendy, and understated decor, a light menu with plenty of finger food, and of course a great wine selection.  The parking was tight, but not terrible.

I went to that location for the first time last week, and it was exactly what I was in the mood for.  It was full of people, but not noisy, with lots of Imogen Heap and Postal Service playing at the right volume.  My one glass of Sangiovese was tasty til the very end.  The bruschetta (on MJ bread, they tell me) was fantastic, and went perfectly with the Italian picnic salad that we split.

I debated between four and five stars, and decided on five because I couldn't think of anything they did wrong.  I don't know if I'd go there if I were really hungry and wanted a full dinner, but for a light meal and a glass of wine, it was just right."
CGd8erq6Ojn834pQ0gpRqA,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"That's right, five stars. But that's based on my first visit, so take it with a grain of salt.

Right across the street from a light rail stop, nice happy hour, free wifi (!!), and teriyaki chicken that's really good. Seriously, I've paid tons more for worse teriyaki at loud sushi bars. The chicken had a great charbroiled flavor, it wasn't rubbery and fake, the veggies were crisp and fresh, and the sauce was flavorful -- so much better than the wad of gloppy corn syrup nastiness I've come to expect from mall food courts.

I would definitely have taken off a star or two if I'd gotten some of the terrible service I read about in other reviews, but for me it was fine. There was only one lady working the register and the drive through, so I can see how it wouldn't take much of a crowd to overload her, but I got lucky."
xmAakatNKpvIJ-Fmq5swCw,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"I'm not one to fling around perfect ratings based on just one visit, but this place made such a great impression on me there was just no alternative. I had the salade niçoise and a side of the herb fries ... MY GOD SO TASTY. The salad had perfectly seared sashimi-grade yellowfin tuna, and the dressing was light and perfect. The fries ... I have no idea how they got the fries so crispy and delicious. After lunch I bought pretty much one of everything from their bakery display case ... their pastry chefs know what they're doing.

I loved the French décor, too. The music was hit and miss though, but no big deal.

Oh, it's not visible from the street, really. It's on the southwest corner of the strip mall. The main entrance faces south."

One really awful experience is all I'm basing this on. We arrived, got seated, ordered sushi. Our server took a while to pick up the sushi sheet, but no big deal; they were busy.

But an hour and a half later, our order still hadn't arrived. Half of it did, after 45 minutes, but all that did was give us a sample to let us know the sushi was ""okay."" Not terrible, not good. The table next to us, who arrived after we did, finished their entire meal in that time. We listened as the far-too-loud music changed from ""horrid '80s cliché butt-rock"" to ""wholly inappropriate thumping techno rave.""

Finally we left. The manager, to be fair, did all the right things: apologized profusely, comped all our food, begged us to come back and give them a second chance. But I'm not sure we will."
PbTh7aX0_yyaXFOXAlhI4A,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,2,"Okay, to be fair, the two-star rating is based on a single visit to The Turf (no longer Turf Accountant, because that made no damn sense anyway). If it had been a better night, I would have given three, maybe even four stars.

The food was okay; better than average bar food, not as good as a restaurant that's really trying. We got a boxty, which was just a pile of veggies in white gravy under a potato pancake thing; kind of tasty, but weird. The salad wasn't bad. The chicken strips were average at best. The beer was good, the atmosphere was exactly what an Irish bar should be, the band was REALLY good.

However.

We got their around 9 on First Friday. It wasn't as busy as I'd feared; we were seated right away, placed our order. Then we waited. For almost an hour. I saw food coming out at a steady pace from the kitchen; I assumed they were just backed up from the First Friday crowd.

Our waiter came around to check on us again, and I finally mentioned that we were getting awfully hungry.  His response, and I swear to God I'm not making this up:  ""Oh, did you order food?""

I blinked at him, and focused on not killing him with my pint glass. Through clenched teeth I said slowly, ""Yes. We did. A lot of it.""

He ran back to the register and put our order in, and our food came out within minutes. I don't know what brain surgery procedure he was prematurely released from, but HOW THE HELL DO YOU FORGET TO PUT IN AN ORDER FOR AN ENTIRE TABLE?

Yes, it was only one mistake, by one person and not the entire restaurant, but it was a pretty fucking huge mistake. If the rest of the experience had been much over average, I might go back. But it wasn't. So I won't."
E9IPxXY6pS2gTW2FBkAJmg,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,4,"My first trip to the Duce was to see the Scandalesque show there.  I had no idea what to expect, which was good, because I would have been wrong.

Inside The Duce, you'll find the following:  a very casual restaurant, a boxing ring, a vintage (REAL vintage, not the fake-vintage hipster fodder) clothing store, an ice cream bar, a tiny boutique-ish grocery area, a café, and (coming soon) a pie shop.

I can only review the restaurant part. The dining area has walls, but no ceiling, making the atmosphere interesting. It also made the atmosphere REALLY COLD ... half of the propane heaters weren't turned on.  The menu is small, with mostly brunch items and sliders, but they do have a few salads and larger plates.  The salads our group ordered were delicious, and the sliders were original and surprisingly fresh. I also had a side of their homemade beans and cole slaw.  The beans seemed to be sweetened with maple syrup to the point where I almost couldn't finish them.  The slaw was just flat-out odd; I still have no idea what was in it.  But it was also incredibly tasty!

On the down side, I think the management is still trying to figure out how to run the place; they seemed overwhelmed by the crowd even before it got very crowded.   But I have faith that this will work itself out. Parking is pretty sparse, but this is downtown; you should expect that. And some of the pricing on the menu doesn't make any sense:  a gourmet salad was only $5, but a tiny dollop of baked beans was $3.50? I hope they make some adjustments soon."

That order was the best one yet, I actually think I got the owner's order or CE saw their Yelp reviews and fixed the problems.

Anyway... I think I got the owner's order because the broccoli beef was mostly beef and only 3 broccoli, usually it's the other way around. I'm a huge broccoli fan so I never complained, but was in total shock when I opened the paper box.
The fried rice had egg in it..... what???? I've been here how many times and this is the first time egg ever slipped into the fried rice haha.

UPDATE 11/9/2013 YELP deleted my photo of the container of chicken tikka masala next to a can of coke. The picture shows the size of the container, smaller than the size of a coke. This was my order, my experience so YELP is being an ass to remove my photo.


On to the review:

This place was a total SHAM. We bought the $25 for $12 take out Groupon. We showed up and asked for a menu (no menu from Kohinoor online, not even on their Facebook. SCAM) , they said they had no menu, WHAT? After asking a couple times the owner said to someone else ""get the menu"" and cocked his head. They managed to come up with a ridiculously priced menu after being there for 10 minutes. $12.99 for chicken tikka masala with no rice or naan. The Biltmore doesn't even charge these prices.

We are a regular of Curry Corner literally a stones throw away and the owner starts talking crap about Curry Corner. At CC you get the tikka masala, rice AND add garlic naan for $10.

Anyway you don't eat chicken tikka masala without rice or naan (and no other restaurant we have ever been to HASN'T offered it) so my husband ordered this for me (it came to $20 here!!!!!) and his Lamb Biryani ($12.99). When the food comes and the owner shows my husband the food my husband is shocked SHOCKED he is charging $12.99 for what CC charges $8, then the owner tells my husband that CC sells a smaller size, that my husband could go to CC right now if he didn't believe him. WHAT!!!! We eat there once a week! I get the same thing @ CC and we would know what size they give us!

My husband is Arab and is talking to the owner who is totally swindling my husband. He gives my husband a small mango yogurt drink and then he goes on to tell us that if we stop going to CC and go to his restaurant that he would sell us the buffet for $8.99 and our kids would eat free (they are 26 months and 9 months).  Then he takes my husband next door to the store to show him the halal meat (is this when they put the buffet food in the take out containers or take the buffet food to the back and make chicken tikka masala and biryani out of the buffet spread? No proof but I wouldn't doubt this).

So my husband said ok, he paid for our food difference $8 and left.
When we got home, his biryani was BEEF not lamb. There was no mix up, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and my husband was talking to the owner the entire time.

This was a HORRIBLE Groupon experience, and a total scam, offering a take out Groupon for $12 for $25 worth of food and then offering ridiculous prices and claiming they don't have a menu.
BY THE WAY they have a lunch buffet for $6.99 and dinner for $9.99 WITH CTM, samosas, rice, naan etc, so prey tell me how they are selling chicken tikka masala TO GO for $12.99 with no rice or naan?

My husband threw out his biryani the beef was inedible (chewy and old, the dish was room temperature) and then he ended up eating leftover bbq pulled chicken sandwich that I made yesterday. I took pictures of my CTM and the container is smaller than the size of a can of coke. CTM was room temperature (it should have been HOT) edible, not good, but not bad  but I wouldn't go back if it was even $5.

In the real world we pretty much got $10 worth of food (inedible BEEF biryani) and we paid $20."

Scanned the restaurant; picnic tables, clean and open. OK., awesome I can bring my toddler and not worry about her ruining other peoples' meals.
Greeted right away by a lady at the ""country store"". She asked us if have been before which we hadn't, I replied that we needed help (I have a20mo and a 4mo infant in a carrier). She came over to show us the menu, the line to place our orders and let us know that the cashier can give us samples of the meats. Fan-frickin-tabulous.


We figured out our order then went to the counter. ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE.
Miss boring-as-all-get-out brunette. She didn't even look at us. HELLooooo.
She wasn't even up at the register, but back about a foot. I asked if they had a kid's menu, she mumbled something incoherent. What??? So 2 registers down was a young man so we passed on miss head in the clouds. As we head to the other register the cashier left. ARGGGGGG! Back to the brunette.
I start the order..... turkey sandwich and brisket sandwich..... to which she yells back and a man starts carving. Sandwiches were brought FAST. Then we ordered potato salad (get it yourself from the fridge), corn and new potatoes. She turns and gets the corn and potatoes, meanwhile my sandwiches are getting cold. COLD.
She tap-types on her register and then says our total. Excuse me, can I order drinks????? Her bubbly reply (add sarcasm) ""oh yeah"".

We grab napkins and a table, apply the bbq sauce and dig in..... to ice COLD meat sandwiches.

Quick back track to the menu...
NO KID's MENU?
No mac and cheese?
No fries?
No cornbread?
No green beans?
No salad?


The good
Turkey was moist and had a good flavor, would have been excellent if warm.
Husband said brisket was really really good, but cold.

The bad
-Sause sucks, worse sauce I ever tasted. Like water and pepper. They have 2 sauces and both taste the same. One has a ton of pepper, the other has more.
-Potato salad, really is potato salad so difficult?
-Corn was soggy and had no flavor.
-Red potatoes (called NEW POTATOES here) are water logged gross.


The ugly
-Napkins on the other side of the restaurant in a dispenser on the wall (bathroom 3-fold paper towel dispenser).
-STYROFOAM- THE DEVIL OF THE PLANET.

The employee said no problem, and  as I started to clean the tables she came over and started cleaning them for me. She pulled chairs and wiped them too.

I tried their Samba roll; it was alright, nothing to write home about. The Vegas room was okay - it was a standard Vegas roll. The fries, the one thing I remember being awesome at the place was alright. Maybe I built it up in my mind and it didn't live up to the hype or perhaps it really wasn't super awesome as I once thought it was. The lobster bisque was good. Didn't have that finish that Wild Fish had, but it was still pretty good. I really appreciate that they have local brews available cause who doesn't love Papago's Orange blossom?

Now onto dessert - had a sample of their some pie and their peanut butter cookie which was chewy but not like undercooked or anything. It was a good finish rather than a full dessert. Topped with ice cream was just extra yummy. The apple pie was okay, but you really need the ice cream to combat the top of the pie. The crust under the filling, which has all the yummy flavorful goodness is better and not so dry. Both desserts are a good size and perfectly capable of being split between two people.

I'd come here again and give the sushi more of a chance cause I do love the burgers here."

I've become a Sunday HH regular here. I can't believe I didn't go here sooner in my whole time living here. The house rolls were half off, appetizers were half off, and the drinks were half off as well.

My favorites here: For the signature drink there, and I did a fair bit of sample them, was the Blue Berrymore. It was a nice drink on a nice summer day. I enjoy their house rolls. The Geisha A Go Go roll was delicious, wrapped in their ""Geisha Green"" soy paper with a jalapeno sauce. The Gaijin roll, a specialty roll here, was yummy. It was an interesting take on a chimi, topped with their chipotle sauce made it super yummy. I really enjoyed the calamari here, again paired with the chipotle sauce for dipping, and the teriyaki ribs, which were so good and tender. The fried rice is really yummy as are their other apps. The ones I mentioned are just my favorites and ones to try. The apps here are a good portion size, unlike some other places, where you can actually share with people.

Now, north Scottsdale is not our normal place and we rarely venture up there but my friend wanted to go. As a girl, I wish he gave me some warning as to what to wear because i noticed the girls there were slightly more dressed up while I was dressed in a t-shirt, jeans, and boots. A pair of heels would've been better to go with the crowd. The place had a good atmosphere, ambiance, and were playing some fun music to get you in the mood for the night if you were going out afterwords. I know I lip synced to a song and serenaded Jason so if his ears were bleeding, from my ""singing,"" his hearing must be going from something else. Or he was too distracted by the cute boy next to us. There was some eye candy there, also why I felt like I should have dressed a bit more.

Anyways, the place was nicely filled and we didn't wait to be seated at a table. We ordered a Diamondback roll, the calamari and the veggie tempura. I've gone to a few sushi places for happy hour and some don't give you the appropriate portion size, but here it was a good size for apps to be shared between two people. The calamari and tempura was all right. The tempura had a nice heat to it as well as our Diamondback roll. We were fairly full from our order.

They let you choose your own soup base, the type of noodle and the ""toppings"" you want. Well I didn't really know what to pick. I didn't any explanations as to what kind the soup bases were; I had to google them on my phone. And for me, the soup base is the most important part so I know what sort of toppings I wanted. So, I sort of just winged it. While my friend went with one of their soups from the menu.

Well, his soup was served first and upon looking at it, it looked like it was lacking, just things in general and was getting worried about mine, which came out a few moments afterwards. Looking at mine and looking at his, I found mine to be very full - full of noodles, veggies and toppings while his, well as stated, was lacking. Well, I can't say I loved my soup. I found it missing something, maybe if I knew more about their soups bases, I might have been better equipped to make choices. The soup didn't suck, but it wasn't as awesome as I wanted it to be.

I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon, but I'd probably try it again to see if it gets better."
0kag5JGemji05P3oxx4lpg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I ordered delivery from here recently and was pleasantly surprised. I had read previous reviews that had me putting off ordering from here. But, when I was moving and had nothing to cook with or eat with since it was packed up, I ordered from here. And the delivery time was about on par for other places. It was a bit busy when I ordered, given it was right around lunch time. But when it was delivered, it was still hot and yummy. The volcano chicken, one of their lunch specials was good; it came with rice and crab puffs. The happy family was good as well. This is a place I'd order from again. Oh and I did like the fact that when you get delivery and use card, they bring the card reader with them rather than giving my card number over the phone."
2GtIC6u4hVneccWfTlOxHQ,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I've been to quite a few buffets and this one was actually pretty decent in comparison to the ones I've been to. This one does have an okay sushi bar; the sushi is made to order rather than just sitting there, waiting for people to pick them up. There is quite a bit of food selection here. My favorite part of the buffet is the Mongolian stir fry just because I love my noodles made to order and their grill was one of the better ones in a buffet that was decent."
89N3YfIoe50feyqS0qwMXg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,5,"Super super super psyched that Cartel is at the airport. I finally get away from Starbucks! Not that I don't love Starbucks, but sometimes - well, most of the time - I just want a coffee that's free of all the frills and shtuff that Starbucks has. They always know how to make my chai just right! The people are super friendly and know their coffee! They make the walk through security worth it!"
AMM3qOH9DUQzJHm9Q3vHag,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,This place isn't bad. They have quite a spread to choose from. It can be hit or miss; I've had things that were too salty and other things that needed more seasoning. I do enjoy the fact that they have a grill and I can make my own stir fry; it kept the whole bad seasoning thing as a problem. And the service wasn't bad and the staff was awesome.
NxjUiGBNgyDErKXnmQ3s3w,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I never knew this place was here until my friend brought me here. I'm an anti-Starbucks girl and I'm a bit picky when it comes to my coffee places, but this place was really good. And I really like their chai and I'm not one for chai, or maybe it's just Starbucks chai. This place is deceiving; it looks tiny from the outside, but when you go in, it's bigger than it looks. The artwork that adorns the space is really cool and interesting. I just wish this place was open later."
w-SkKR92IBQMJmI_pUjKGw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,5,"I love this place. It's way better than the chains in Cali. I love their BBQ sauce and their curry chicken katsu is yummy. And I love their mac salad. The mini portions are not really mini, at least for me. It's a fairly big portion size. I will make the short trek out here when I get the craving for Hawaiian BBQ. The others aren't as awesome as this place :)"
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I really am a fan of this place. It has good food and good beer, and also is associated with some good memories here. This place is a great place to come to and watch a game or two. Or in our case, a great place to come to after watching out team win or lose the game. The parking here can be difficult since there is no lot or anything designated for costumer parking. The beer is really good here. I like the lighter beers, such as their regular peach beer, but their other beers and seasonal are awesome too. The food is delish; I always get a hankering for their beer battered fries. Eat it with their jalapeño ranch sauce and it's perfect. That and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends; their portion sizes are fairly huge. It's really an awesome spot to get together with friend, have a pint, enjoy a game and some good food."
2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Love this place. I always tell myself to eat my way through their menu but I never do. I always get the same thing I usually do, which is the chicken shawarma plate. I love it! I get my hummus & pita fix as well as the always yummy garlic sauce on the chicken. I try and get extra garlic sauce with mine :) Get extra pita cause they do give a good serving of hummus. Also, the rice is yummy, although last time I was there, the rice was different than usual."
2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I really like this place. My food was not disappointing. I've had their tortas, specifically their Ranchera de pollo and their Torta Nortena de pollo. I liked that there was a slight bit of heat, not enough to send one running for water and not too little that one would want to douse their tortas with hot sauce. Their tortas are served with a side of potato chips. The tortas are a good size. I can finish a whole one when I'm starved, but otherwise, I take half and save it for later since the serving size was a bit much for me. Next time, I totally need to get some sopes since i have yet to find a good place yet and need to check out their Lengua torta. I have to also mention their aguas cremosas, which are delish; it's a yummy drink/dessert. Also, the staff was nice, the prices were good and its a clean lil place."
0aSvr56wz4gRAA5TtV7_Tw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,1,"Zuma is a seemingly fun happening place on Mill. I've been to Zuma a few times in the past and have never really cared for it. And I have yet to find a reason as to why it seems to always be packed. The smokers' patio in the front must be why it always seemed packed thereby giving off the illusion that it's packed because at times, when you get past the packed smokers' patio, and actually enter the bar itself, it's dead.

Given, they have some decent music and they have drink special that aren't that bad, but the atmosphere and the people aren't enough to overcome their shortcomings. The crowd there seems to be trying a bit too hard to be something they obviously are not. The girls are trying a bit too hard and end up seeming classless. For The men, well can anyone ""Tool Academy, future class of ...""? Actually, the students of Tool Academy might be a step up from the men that seem to gravitate to and work at Zuma. The bartenders are a bit of an ass hat, what with their superior attitude and their less than superior looks. You think if they'd be trying to imitate a Scottsdale feeling, the tool of a bartender would at least mix like one and look like one if they insist on wearing those tight V neck tees. Their mixing abilities, not the best. I get my usual mixed drink and it wasn't up to par as it is in some other places.

The only way to survive this place is if you're already drunk."
pdr6U7qSa9jIivVy_glF-w,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"This place was not bad. It was all right and for the price and food offered. Like the other buffets, there was sushi offered and it wasn't bad. There was the typical type of food they offer at other buffets. To me, this is a typical kind of buffet and it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best I've gone to."
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"If I knew vegan food was this fantastic, I'd totally convert and be a Vegan. I recently went to Green out in South Scottsdale and I have been trying to eat my way through the menu.

For their starters, I've tried the samosa, the chili fries, the egg rolls and ""wings."" Out of those, I'd say my favorites have been the wings. If you didn't know they were mock meat, I'd still think they were just like boneless pieces of chicken cause the sauce with the wings was fantastic. And the chili fries were fantastic! I usually get the chili on the side to avoid making the thyme fries too soggy.

I've only done two of the bowls - the drunken mushroom chicken and the diablo red with mock beef. The two bowls were seasoned fantastically and yummy. I do need to try more bowls. I've tried more of the sammies and burgers. The original ""g""spicy po-boy is fantastic, but I may be biased since I really loved the wings and that's what they put in this po-boy lol. I tried their no-harm parm chicken sandwich, but wasn't that big of a fan of it, but it was because my mock chicken patty and its breading was coming off and apart due to the tomato sauce so it wasn't enjoyable. My favorite by far was the Mexicali burger; it's a fantastic, slightly spicy, mouthful. As I've said, I'm trying to eat my way through the menu, but I couldn't pass up having another mexicali burger again lol.

The tSoynamis, their ice cream dream desserts, are a simplistic tasty orgasmic mouthful. The have specialty ones featured off their usual menu; I love their recent one with the butterfingers. It's so yummy and makes me want a butterfinger lol. Their Soy Captain tSoynami makes me want Captain Crunch. Their Cookies 'n' Cream and Ts'more tSoynami is yummy as well. The Cookies 'n' Cream one is a chocolatey heaven. They have an awesome PB&J tSoynami, which is by far my favorite!

I am so going back and making a dent in their menu!"
XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,2,"I've had better than this place. Yes it had unlimited sushi and other seafood, but the rest of the food was not bad but not good. I found that the only ""highlight"" was the dessert selection. I really wouldn't go back unless someone else paid."
5AuwZcLcGIpe1yhSKgSwlw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Love this place. It's yummy, cheap and the portion sizes are huge. I usually get the same thing even though I tell myself to try something new, but I can't help myself lol. I forget the number, but it's the one with noodles, pork, egg roll with veggies :P I tend to get the same meal every time I try a new Vietnamese place to try and gauge how I like it before I stray to something new. I failed to do so a few times and I ended up unsatisfied lol. Yes, the place looks sketchy, but it's yummy!"
ioY-a1TntpsAGJAG5_1Zyw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,2,"So this place use to be awesome. Well at least I remember it being awesome. I remember the pizza was better and I remember the Greek fries were hella awesome. It's not so awesome anymore. I had the fries recently and they kind sucked, I was super disappointed. It was too cheesy, the dressing that it comes with didn't have the flavor it had. The fries left me feeling wanting. And to think, I used a cheat day on those fries makes me feel worse lol."
uanXiHUBGq-6e6n5XwhzhA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I use to be a Los Betos girl, but I have converted over to Super Burrito lol. I still like them, but I find that Super Burrito has more choices and they have things available 24/7. Los Betos no longer has some of their breakfast items available past a certain time as they once did. And they don't let one do some changes to some of their orders the way they do at Super Burrito. And their churros are yummy along with their tongue tacos. I really dig their Arizona quesadilla. For some reason, I find it better as a quesadilla than as a burrito. It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food."
NO-kZ9See-AXcZDtssJMmw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,2,"The food was all right, nothing too outstanding about it and nothing too bad about it. The service was all right. I find that the price was a bit much. I can understand paying extra if they were including their hot pot in the price, but they don't; they charge extra."
ydt5yifyYhF5s430llv_Hw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,2,This place is ok at best. I can see why people would like it - it's only good during like happy hour. The food was all right. The Drinks were all right. The service was all right. There really wasn't anything awesome about this place that would make me rave about it or go out of my way to go there.
I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,I love this alternative to ice cream and froyo. I love the taro and condensed milk glaze. The topping can be interchangeable. So far I really love it with almonds cause I love the crunch. The shaved ice is great cause it isn't too heavy and it's just sweet enough. This place is definitely a place to try!
GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I like this place. It's close to campus for a good price and good portion sizes. I like their yummy Chicken Tikka Masala! They give you a good portion sizes. The other dishes were pretty good, samosas were ok, their curry is tasty and the food isn't that spicy. Super love their tikka masala fries. Yeah, I said tikka masala fries!

They're currently undergoing renovations to make the place a bit bigger and it's needed since it can get busy and full."
C8D_GU9cDDjbOJfCaGXxDQ,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I recently went here with my friends for a late night dinner on a Saturday night. I like the ambiance of the place. There was a live band and they were all right, but I found them to be a bit loud and made it difficult to talk to the people at the same table. The drinks here were really awesome. I really enjoyed the clown punch. The dirty school girl was also really good. The wait staff was really attentive and would check up on us every so often that we rarely found ourselves without want, but not so attentive that we found ourselves annoyed. The food was all right. I ordered the fish and chips here. And it was just all right in my opinion. I prefer a thinner filet of fish so I get the crispness rather than the softness when getting into the meat of the filet. The real highlight, for me, was the dessert. They have an awesome apple monkey bread that is made to order and served with vanilla ice cream. Now I'm not one to like to eat fruit, especially apple, in my desserts, but this was just so good. I'll go back again just to top off dinner with the monkey bread :)"
7b7Hj8hdcObDoBcBqL4MVg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Taking a break from the Old Town Scottsdale club scene and trying the other bars in the area had me going to the Rusty Spur Saloon. And I must say, I loved the place. The bar decor is that awesome cowboy look. It was a small place and yet they still managed to fit a band in there along with some seating. I don't know how but they did lol. The drinks were good and cheap and it's a great alternative to the usual scene."
cclDCELdBQmJMWUyVWo5fw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Love the vibe of this place. It's fun and chill and can have a good crowd. Didn't get to try too much of the food, but what I did try, the mac and cheese, was really yummy and the wine selection wasn't bad and the fact that they had happy hour certainly doesn't hurt either. My friend had a table for his birthday and it was really great and the staff was super. And the music was pretty good and there was a place to actually dance if you wanted to. It's a place worth going to when you're looking for dinner and drinks or an alternative to the usual dance clubs in Old Town."
OY0-hYJ2q6WiAqhYnCZZ0w,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I recently checked out this place after a friend had a craving for a hot dog/brat. I was curious to see how this place was, now that it was taking over the space that was previously Oregano's. The area that was once parking is now an awesome wide open patio area. And the fans going in the patio area made it bearable to be out there.

I wanted to guest chef sausage, but sadly, they were out, so I ended up going with the beer brat with relish. It was yummy. There was bit of heat to it, but not too much, just enough to keep it from needing any condiments to help in the taste department. They offered not only the usual, but they had a section for gourmet and exotic meats. Also got a side of fries with their hush hush sauce and their chipotle aioli. Their hush hush is reminiscent of In N Out's sauce which was yummy as was their chipotle sauce. They did offer ketchup and curry ketchup, but I didn't really indulge in that, but the curry ketchup was good with a fry or two. I did appreciate their beer selection. I tried their Lindemans framboise and their one that was apple. I think next time some of the other beers need to be tried but in the boot :P"
znNyiHZs5TAX64WonjJ4dg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Love this place to get my late burrito fix. I especially love it after a night out. The place is awesome. Yes, it's greasy but it's yummy. I know, bad, but like I said, yummy. The portion sizes at this place are huge and their food is pretty cheap. I like getting my carne asada burritos as well as a California burrito. I also really enjoy their carnitas burrito, thanks to my friend Jason, and I do like their chorizo burrito when I get in the mood for a breakfast burrito."
M7N_LeUEcQTfzaeCgJL5mg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I love the vibe of this place. It's fun and laid back. The day life is just as awesome as the nightlife. They have a rockin' happy hour and the pool is awesome, especially since it's getting warm again. They play some awesome music and the staff is pretty cool"
-FLnsWAa4AGEW4NgE8Fqew,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I went with my friends for brunch New Years and this place was nicely packed, the wait wasn't that long. I ordered the Whole Hog omelette and it was good and meaty. It was a huge portion size; I couldn't finish the whole thing. The Bar Harbour flapjacks were really delicious too with their berry puree to top it off. My friend got the Bird, the other omelette I was thinking about ordering, and he gave me a taste of it and I knew I should have ordered that. It was really good. I'll be sure to order that next time I go there."
0owO8bvP8RgiAgimOLxXhw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,1,"If I were writing this review on food alone, I'd give the place like 4 stars. They have really good food. They have this awesome pork belly biscuit app that is yummy. Good grilled cheese sandwich with some bacon and arugula that makes it a bit different from the usual. They have a good sangria that's like juice. I was looking forward to trying out different stuff when I went again, but I ran into the same problem, but magnified that I ran into last time I went, and that was poor service.

I and a group of my friends went back, wanting them to experience the food as well. And we went on a Friday night around 9:30 and, as expected, it was busy. Now, the last time I went, it was another Friday night around 8 and their place was slow, like the only tables in were ours, a table of 6 on a high top, and a few other patrons at the bar. Service was slow then too. I chalked it up to the fact that our server was pulling double duty and playing bartender.

But tonight was different. It was busy. It was like 15-20 minutes before happy hour, the band was going and the place was packed, like the usual restaurants in the area on a Friday night. And tonight, we were seated fairly quickly. Well, more like we were escorted to our table and then stood around, waiting for it to be bussed, but we were fine with that. We were able to sit down and peruse the menu. We were trying to make up our mind, when the person we thought was the server came over. It turned out that the guy wasn't our server, just a guy dropping off the silverware and plates. He apologized and corrected us in our error and assured us that our server would come by shortly.

Well that didn't happen. People came by, and they kept on going by. At one time, one my friends attempted to call the restaurant in order to get someone to get to the table, but no one answered. Maybe the band was too loud or maybe they just don't answer their phones. It was then, that was had a glimmer of hope - a server heading in our direction. And what did this server do? Keep on passing us by. Well, needless to say, that was the end of that visit. We had had enough. We don't think we're gonna be back, at least not for a long while."
6tLL1P8k9drb7MJEVwmRhg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Love this place. And it's so close to home! I love their selections of beers! I love that the servers there are so knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to trying to figure out what beer I want. Thanks to all the random samples, I've expanded my favorites to not only include their orange blossom, which by the way taste like an orange creamsicle, but their hefeweizen. Their food wasn't anything exciting, just good to nosh on while you get your drink on. Since they've changed up their layout, adding more space and tables, it makes it easier to find tables. The other patrons are cool and chill. It's an awesome place to go to and spend any night in :)"
d-wvSnFt6JAZBzqMiGpvyQ,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I really appreciate that there's a Sauce at the airport. It's a better alternative to the other pizza places that are a bit blah. It's a good place to have lunch. Food is always yummy and comes out in a timely manner, which is always appreciated since I have a limited lunch break. I've eaten my way through most of the menu, but haven't gotten around to the breakfast just yet. I did see that they have a breakfast pizza which piques my interest so I'll have to give that a try sometime."
V9bs-9SqhlryOCLy6vk6gg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"When I am craving really awesome fish and chips, this is the place to go. Especially on fridays, where their fish and chips is all you can eat! Although, be warned that the fish and chips servings are huge so come super hungry lol. And Fridays, they have some live music adding to the awesome vibe of the place. It's an awesome cool place to have a drink and get my fish and chippies on :)"
za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"I was looking for a place for a place to eat on here and saw that people reviewed it, giving it fairly good reviews. So, I went and grabbed take out from here. I ordered the carnitas from here. The carnitas were good and a hearty portion. I do wish that there was a bit more heat or kick to them and their salsa, but it was good. I was gonna go with a burger or, because it was early enough, I was going to get something like waffles, but I was curious to see how their Mexican food was. The place is a cute little place with, as people have said, an eclectic menu. They had good service with an attentive staff. I think next time I'll go back and try their burgers or breakfast food."
O_2VEWa6ExYX5HpF3GW5yg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Been to Pearl a few times now. And it's always been during their happy hour. I have to say that their happy hour is pretty great. I think I've had a good few items off their happy hour menu and they were delicious. The Korean pork tacos were yummy along with their signature rolls. I particularly like their fish shtick.  And their bombers are pretty delish too. My favorite is cluster bomb.
The vibe of the place is pretty awesome and it's a good place to go out to whether is be for happy hour or a place to go to before a night out. It is in Old Town and in the same area as Jackrabbit."
DkIEhR8behaIoSexekWV0Q,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,5,"Well I just keep loving LGO! I blame the baked goods that always seem to entice me when I go. Just when I think I'm done placing an order, I look over in the display at the pastries that seem to call out to me and say ""Dani, look at me! Eat me! I'm yummy!"" I'm making my way through their menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Well I'm not counting the time where I found that they stopped serving chilaquiles, I'm meaning taste wise."
wN2zNgEK-QizEA_NKAHj6Q,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"I give this place a 3.5. I went here a bit ago for reverse happy hour. I had gone to RA on Mill Ave once, a looong time ago. I remember thinking it was good before, but I think it's just cause I was not so widely exposed to sushi and plus, the ambience - being on Mill, with friends, during college, and the beginning of a night out - was what made it fun. So, going to this location was all right. The sushi was decent, nothing too special. I did however enjoy the drinks. They had the ingredients available to make my drink, a Geisha Flower. And surprisingly, other sushi joints don't have some ingredients so that's what made, hence the 3.5 and not just a 3."
Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I've been here once and thought it was alright. I only had the pizza and thought it was delicious - it was the crust that made it super yummy as well as their wine coolers, but there was nothing fabulous that would have me coming back all the time. So when I went again, I knew I was in store for yummy pizza but not sure what else.

I, and a friend, went back on a busy night. There were people waiting, even outside on a cold rainy night. While we waited, we managed to find a place at the bar and grabbed a beer. The wait didn't seem long and we were seated at a booth. The service was awesome, which was expected since last time was awesome, regardless of knowing one of the bartenders who took care of my friend and I.

Anyways, we started off our meal with their BOH soup. From my experience, in general, BOH soup is always yummy and worth trying! And their soup was worth trying, although I wish their soup of the night had been a bit spicier, it was good. My friend also had moved on from the beer to the hibiscus wine cooler and it was super yummy. I do need to order that next time.

After the soup, we were going to get two pizzas but decided to try an app and a pizza. Experience from last time told me that two pizzas would not be even close to being finished. The app we went for was the Meatball Trio. I wanted to try it for the polenta, the meatballs we're just bonus. I really liked it! The crunch from the polenta with soft yummy meatballs and their marinara sauce was awesome. And the pizza we had - the Manifesto - was just as awesome! I'm not normally a fan of goat cheese or fennel, but on the pizza, it was delish.

And when we thought we had had enough, we decided on dessert. We got a cobbler. Now I'm not a fan of cobblers or fruit pies, but their cobbler was something I ate up. The crust and fruit filling was awesome and was served hot so eating it with ice cream was a must. I just wish there was another scoop of ice cream since the one scoop melted into the dessert lol.

I will make sure to keep coming back and easy my way through their menu :p"
SYKIUCvN9JdSkVampgccfA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,I'm a fan of this place. It's cheap and a good place to go to when you have a late night hankering since it's open 24 hours. I like the California burrito and their chicken tacos; they're not as greasy as some of the other places I've tried. Their cheap beef tacos aren't bad and I do like their french fries. It's good a good place with good food and I come back here whenever the mood strikes.
oplwp3MumIb_dJI9fmKbSw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"I've been to a fair share of buffets, for brunch, lunch and dinner. And I have to say, there's no beating their price. I mean, come on - $6.99 for a dinner buffet and that included a fountain drink. At least that's what it was when we went earlier this week. I don't know how long they've had that price going or for how long that price will be around for. The place looked okay although we sat at a table that was directly underneath a light fixture that kept turning on and off sporadically throughout our dinner.

There really wasn't anything super special about the place, aside from the price. The food was all right. Some things were too salty, and that's something since I when I went, I was PMSy, wanting that salt lol. I didn't try any of their sushi or noodles so I can't comment on that. Their dim sum was decent and so was their crawfish.

Overall, decent. Nothing too exciting, their selection was okay, but there are other places with more. Maybe it's better on the weekend. It's worth trying for the price."
xtJ9ELoKVMbRwZ0ktbVTlA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,5,"So since I started working morning and being around breakfast food, I get a craving for fried eggs and bacon on my burger and thank goodness for Modern Burger and their breakfast burger. I get the yummy cheeseburger with my breakfast accoutrements lol. And to top it off, I still get their awesome fries. And when I want to splurge, I get another shake of the month, which so far hasn't disappointed me yet."
3vOWSanFt56CwRJOE9Kj_g,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"Came here expecting the worse just based on the average reviews for this place on yelp. And I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were super helpful in recommending alternate beers and they even give you samples to make sure you'll like something. Even on a busy night, the staff still made it to our table and had time to talk and recommend beers and even do samples :) And for the friends at our table that didn't want to wait, which wasn't too long, just went to the bar and got service there fine.
Some nights are louder than others, depending on the amount of people and if there's a band, but every time I go back, the level of service hasn't changed and I always find more and more yummy beers. And I have to say, that some of the beers they offer here just don't taste the same at other places where they offer the same beer. I really like this place. And it's becoming one of the places that I like to go on a regular. I so need to go back and get like a service industry card!"
sFg3G8-oMGeiHYsVqKN7PQ,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I really like this place. They have awesome waitresses; they're always so nice and sweet to us when we come in. I love that it's a diner and it hits the spot when I have a mad craving for breakfast food. I love getting their country fried steak, which is like twice as big as the portion sizes you can get at the other places, like Denny's and such. Their serving sizes here are huge in general. The cinnamon bun, which is delish with the melted butter, is pretty big; it looks like it's be as big as one of my jazz hands. The fried chicken is yummy although, I don't really care for their veggie sides cause they're over cooked and all the goodness seems to be gone. I think that's my only complaint about the place."
0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"So I seem to have a love-hate relationship with this place. At times I love it and at times I hate. Lately it's been the latter of the two unfortunately. Going here for food wasn't bad. In fact, it was delish, but going here and experiencing the night life has not been awesome as it once was. While it is in part due to the people that go here - a bunch of douchey guys and the girls that go with them (it is Old Town) - I can deal with them cause mixed in there are some cool people. What I can't deal with are some of the people working there, starting with the door guys who seem to relish the power and enjoy letting people know it. And if they weren't bad enough, let's get into the bartenders.

I've known some bartenders and I did the whole bar tending thing and no where in all that I learned and know, did they mention giving people crap service. I get it, you're busy and you get slammed, but you get through it and they should want to take and make as many drinks as they can rather than being all selective and choosing certain people over others. I'm sorry, I don't want to swoon over the bartenders, I just want my drink. And, when they finally decide to deign me with their presence and place my order, they get it wrong. And trying to flag them back over after they hand you your bill to point out the mistake wasn't even worth trying since trying to get their attention the first time too a bit of work.

The servers were all right; haven't had anyone exceptional to rave or rant about. The music is usually pretty awesome. And as I've said, there are some pretty awesome people worth going back for, as well as their food. I do enjoy their happy hour menu.
I just know that before going to El Hefe, I need to start out somewhere else if I want a drink and then head over, as is the usual plan when we go out."
IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I recently went here for brunch/lunch with my mom since I eat at the Chelsea's airport location quite a bit. I always hear from people at the airport that the street side location is so nice and I have to say I agree. It's so pretty, the layout and the patio area was gorgeous the day we went since the weather cooperated. Since the street side location has more items than the airport, I decided to venture to give them a try, such as the lobster slidersand the mac and cheese, both items that I wish were available at the airport cause they were delicious. The service was awesome; the staff were really friendly.
Next time, I totally need to try the veggie tacos or the tuna burger. My mom liked her Howie burger and I told her to get it with the kale slaw, but I ended up eating her kale slaw and she had to get a side order of fries lol. I really wanted to do dessert, but that didn't happen cause I should have known better; I should have known to leave room for dessert. I know, I was a ditz that day and wasn't thinking, but next time I'm all over it."
nl_gkvVXtsIlhGE0sP0qFw,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"The place was all right. I liked that they had a wide array of food to choose from, I just wish it were consistent and better. Some of the food, I found to be off, which could be a bit too salty, a bit too bland, a bit oddly tasting, or a bit cold for my liking. I appreciate that there was a mongolian grill, but I wish there were more options for me to put in my stir fry. The sushi, overall, was ok. I knew it was fresh, since there was a sushi chef there, putting sushi out. The sushi was hit or miss; I found some of it to be pretty decent and some to be kinda salty. The dessert pastries were dry, almost hard and their cheesecake was still a bit too hard from being frozen. The service was okay as well. It wasn't bad, but at some point in the visit, we had a few plates pile up and empty cups on the table for a bit before anyone came over to remove them or refill. So in comparison to other buffets, this one was just all right. It wasn't spectacular and it wasn't horrible; I would come back and maybe give this place another chance."
xImiQIhC2ZBDEy7LhpQ4nQ,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"Finally made it over to try one of the newer concepts in the airport! I kept hearing about how awesome it was but I have to say, I don't think it lived up to the hype. The staff was super nice and helpful. The restaurant itself was nice, reminding me of the street side location but the food was nothing too awesome. I will go back and have a try of something else cause I don't want to just write off a place based on something like the West Coast Wrap, which could be a taste preference. I think I'll go and have a try of the mac and cheese and judge it off that cause that'll be a make or break thing for me lol."
6sKaAF8WhWyyCjfZr2Rfsg,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"I have been here a few times and figured it's time to write a review. This place, overall is an all right spot. They have happy hour specials practically all night, every night. The only time they seem to lack happy hour is from 7pm to 8pm lol. And I know that they have weekend specials for those weekend ball games and whatnot. It's awesome. The food is pretty yum too. The only reason I didn't give the place four stars is due to my experience tonight.

Zipps is a sports bar. And it's football (pre)season. They should have at least one TV dedicated to the home team, but they. I get that they couldn't get the ASU game due to the whole TV dispute, but to not have the Cards - Bronco game is ridiculous considering it's on ABC. And when they finally did have it on, it was a bit difficult to have someone change the channel on the right TV. I get that it was busy, but that shouldn't be an excuse to not listen to your customers. If anything, they should make a conscious effort to hear their customers and make sure they're happy.

Anyways, I'm sure i'll go back some time, but I'll probably have to call ahead and make sure they have the games I want on."
jRfQX8enRhWHf7V5zP5U8g,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,5,"Love the G-Spot. I like gelato in general just cause I don't feel so bad when I start fiendin' for some chocolate. And The Gelato spot is as good as it gets. I like the variety of flavors they offer. And if you're wondering what it'll taste like, you can always get a sample. You can mix and match all the flavors as much as you want. I really like the snickers gelato flavor with some mint chocolate chip. Just writing this review makes me want to get some lol. I love this location; being on the corner and on Scottsdale Rd, it makes it perfect to sit and people watch. It's really great for grabbing dessert after dinner or if you just want some sweet yummy goodness."
BHMqFvtguSDrZLQPtjZSuA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,3,"I went to this place and had the carne asada burrito people seem to really like and I have to say the place and the burrito wasn't bad. It was close to home, cheap, and a good place to get a quick fix. I liked it well enough and the food was a good portion size for the price. I'd go back again."
R1oI13c1oNxE91wkjYDeow,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,2,"The place is nice, good atmosphere and such. Now the food... Well, I've had better sushi, especially for the prices they were charging. The drinks were all right, but once again, they were a bit overpriced."
I3STZd5iAvUL9MNLF_DUug,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"So since that first burrito, I have been back a few times to try something new each time. And I have to say that the burritos haven't changed in taste or size lol. It's still yummy and still hefty enough to be shared. There was still a weird after taste but I found that it grew on me. The chicken burrito was yummy but I think I like the machaca burrito the best. Get a burrito with some salsa and some guac and I'm a happy girl."
plWuv4gda7m0KlqCNhrb4w,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"I super love that they have Spam and can add it to things! Love the different types of beer. I had #3, a raspberry wheat by grand canyon brewing; smell of raspberry and initial taste is the fruit with the after taste being kinda creamsicle-y. They also have draft wines.
So, to start off, we had the Mess, which was a mess, but a hot delicious one! The gravy that comes atop the fries was delish. The fries weren't too skinny and didn't get too soggy from the gravy but then again, I don't we let it sit long enough to get soggy. And the cheese curds made for a nice crunch with it. After eating it, I really wanted to add Spam and get a side of gravy lol. Maybe next time.
After the mess, it was now onto the pizza - the meaty treat. It certainly was a meaty treat for your mouth. It had all sorts of meat but with the added Spam, what can I say but 'heaven' (I'm Asian and I love my Spam). Next time, and there will be a next time, there should be a flight involved and another pizza with more Spam lol."
8nP8ghEpT6WFcM6tfqAaGA,W7Nl3wEibJ5VgFlJLvPA4Q,4,"This place is too cute. All the pink, the Family Circus comics, and the throwback to the old school soda parlors makes the atmosphere and ambiance of this place. I've been going here for a while. I remember my pre-21 nights when I would venture out with friends for a late night treat. The place, on the weekends, would be open till midnight. I love their ice cream, I will get my mint chocolate chip ice cream to go. I also really love their Top Hat and Tin Roof Sundaes."
HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,5,I've been eating at the various Somburros locations for many years.  My go-to items are the shredded chicken tacos and the shredded beef burro.  The tacos are a great deal on Tuesdays for $2 a taco and the burros are reasonably priced as well.  The chips and salsa are free and they'll give you more if you ask.  Tip: smother everything in the somewhat spicy salsa.
tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"I've been here a few times for the awesome reclining, cushy seats.  There is a ton of room in each seat and ample leg room even when fully reclined.  All of the seats are assigned which allows you to get there late if you want.  Besides the great seats, every Tuesday night all movies are only $5.  In addition, you can refill your soda for free if you are willing to exit your comfortable seat.  The only food delivery I've seen is pizza from the local pizza place next door.  I have yet to try this option but who doesn't want pizza during your movie!!  Definitely check this place out.  The only time I ever had an issue was the theater adjacent to the mini golf and bowling since it is not sound-proofed enough."
xDY01sZnL7FeqEXnYC_BRA,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"Decided to try this place since I received a coupon in the mail.  It's similar to other pizza buffets except that it has a huge selection.  They have over 20 pizzas to pick from and another 8 or more dessert pizzas.  They also have a salad bar and a pasta bar.  I personally stuck to the pizza.  Easily my favorite is the firefighter.  It's quite spicy and has great flavor.  Most of the other selections were also quite tasty.  And who doesn't love a great dessert pizza.  Now, here's the bad.  The crust is incredibly tough.  My jaw was sore after leaving this place.  Still, I would probably go back for the interesting flavors, especially the firefighter pizza."
0TgBr7wAMQOij6_JP9q3ag,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,3,I was a bit underwhelmed after trying this place for the first time.  The crust was a bit thin for my liking and the only regular soda they serve is Pepsi and diet Pepsi.  They have a good selection of toppings including pulled pork which I haven't seen at competing locations.  The vinegarette salad dressing was way too thick.  For my money I like mod pizza better and the pizza was more filling.
OY0-hYJ2q6WiAqhYnCZZ0w,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"I've tried this place for lunch many times.  We usually order the pretzel and beer cheese to start.  The pretzel is soft and tasty, but not huge.  They do also have a massive pretzel for larger groups, but I've yet to try it.  However, the reason to come here is the homemade brats which are spectacular.  My personal favorite is the spicy pepperjack.  Just the right amount of spice served on a hoagie bun with two toppings of your choice.  The fries are also pretty solid.  My only complaint about this place is the high prices.  $9 for a brat and $4 for fries is steep for lunch and throw a drink on top of that and you're nearing $20 with tip."
QS3QxI7u5PRdtbGgI0-UsA,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,3,"Ordered the spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll.  Both were delicious, although the 2nd roll came out 20 minutes after the first only after I inquired about it.  However, the service as usual was poor.  The server spoke little to no English and seemed confused most of the time.  Other servers had to refill my drink.  Will probably come back because the prices are decent, but will hope for better service."
L9pTWWAATj7HoLaRe6ZA1Q,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"After walking in, it was obvious this was a small family run business.  I ordered the Buffalo chicken cheesesteak and my friend ordered the original Philly.  Both were quite tasty.  The fries were thicker than normal but were cooked to a nice and crunchy golden color.  The staff was friendly and the place was quite busy although does not have much indoor seating for larger groups.  I will probably go back if I'm in the area."
tUFMDX155FxhNX3sQb2dDQ,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"First time at the shake shack.  Ordered the smoke shack without cheese, fries, and a drink.  The burger had good flavor and the cherry peppers were a nice addition.  The fries were crispy and plentiful.  My biggest gripe would be the cost, over $12 for everything seems a bit steep and the fact that I can't refill my drink without going to the counter is annoying.  All in all a solid burger, but smashburger is still my go-to place and they have many more locations in my area."
Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,3,"Small little place that serves a combination of Chinese and Vietnamese food.  The menu is pretty limited but I tried the beef pho and the chicken and snow peas dish.  The pho had good flavor although the bean sprouts, jalapenos, etc were not brought out until I had eaten for 5 minutes.  The chicken dish was a little more disappointing since it had very little flavor and the portions were quite small.  The staff was friendly and the prices were decent, but the food was pretty average."
fRa7CBtfVWJmgWmAlSFkjQ,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"Tiny little place but made up for it with big flavor.  I ordered the garlic and black pepper chicken.  I asked for thai hot and the server warned me that it was really hot!  She wasn't kidding!!  The first few bites were delicious and then the heat kicked in.  Most places don't make it as spicy as I like, but this place did not disappoint.  While it was a pretty simple dish, the garlic and pepper was the star of the dish.  It didn't come with a big portion of rice, but who needs all of those calories anyway?  The summer roll that came with lunch was nothing special, basically a tiny salad wrapped in rice paper.  It was also pretty busy for lunch, which is always a good sign.  Will definitely try this place again."
FW7uAWuXX7YNMHDJyotsgQ,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"I've been here many times for lunch and birthday parties.  The best deal at this place is the lunch buffet.  They have a decent variety of pizza along with breadsticks, cheesy bread (my favorite), salad, and dessert pizza.  I usually eat too much since it's a buffet, but it's a good deal for the price.  The normal pizza prices are a bit high for the quality, but with a coupon it's not bad.  Kids of course love this place due to the many games and chance to win tickets and ultimately candy and trinkets.  Most of the games are one or two tokens so .25 to. 50 each.  This place is big and their birthday packages are pretty reasonable."
cOZLg1c-UcB2Yj3baQDKkA,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"There are many things to love about the keg.  The sour dough bread that comes with the meal is awesome.  The outdoor patio is great when the weather permits and the bar area is quite cozy.  The main entrees themselves are average to good.  I had the full rack of ribs.  They were fall of the bone which I like, but didn't have much flavor and were more fatty than I like.  My friend ordered the prime rib which was considerably better, but was slightly overcooked.  It did have excellent flavor though.  Our server was amazing.  He was very friendly, knew the specials well and didn't badger us with lots of up-selling.  All in all a good experience!"
PcqvHCSagI_2eq_I-Sza7A,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"I've been to the waffle love food truck a few times.  However, it's nice that they have a permanent location now.  I ordered the banana chocolate delight which had bananas, embedded chocolate squares, and cream on top.  The Liege waffle itself has a unique and tasty flavor.  The chocolate could have been melted more but the whipped cream on top was delightful.  The price was $7 which isn't bad, but it certainly won't fill you up for lunch.  Next time I will treat this place as dessert only."
9SQjISnyclrVVAS1FlzE-g,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,2,"Decided to try this new place today.  I ordered the sweet pork enchiladas since it was the daily special.  They came with rice, choice of beans and a small salad portion.  Usually with these assembly line type places the food is only luke-warm.  And.. this place was no different.  The beans had very little flavor and the sweet pork tasted like it was covered in sugar.  It is almost a carbon-copy of Cafe Rio including the bright colored chairs."
105f7-pVm48HQDB2BGk11g,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"If you're in a hurry and on a budget, this is the place to go for a burger.  Best fast food burger for the price (around $7 for the double combo), plus the fries are hand-cut and always fresh.  The options are limited but there are several hidden menu choices if you ask such as fried onions, lettuce instead of bun, etc."
l4pAkHCVUKAcDvo-iNSbYA,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"Interesting little place.  In a nutshell it's basically raw fish/seafood over rice or salad.  I chose the salad option with two types of ahi tuna, one plain and one marinated.  I combined this with the citrus sauce which tasted like a sweet vinaigratte, so good.  I topped it off with Edamame, crab, onions, jicama, sprouts, and cucumber.  Overall the combination was better than I expected.  As an avid sushi eater, it was a refreshing way to eat sashimi instead of the heavy rice.  The regular portion was a good lunch size and paired with a drink was around $11.  I would suggest going by 11:30 since it did get busier around noon.  And definitely get the citrus sauce!"
EfmP_Rn43N0XbqbiBShG9A,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"Small place tucked away in Scottsdale.  I ordered the kao pad with chicken (basically fried rice) which also came with soup or salad.  The soup was nothing special, but the chicken fried rice was good.  The staff was very friendly and they always kept my drink full which is important when you order the dish hot or thai hot.  The place was dead at 11:30, but was completely full by 12:30.  I will definitely try this place again and try the Thai soup bowls which looked quite good."
DzVexh7EGld_2ziA1lRq9w,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,5,I love going to this location.  The burgers are always delicious and fresh and the shoestring fries hot and crunchy.  The staff is always friendly and helpful and the manager Jared rocks.
7J_8O6w79raFRSORc3bRew,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,2,"Nice little place in Gilbert.  I ordered the P2 beef pho bowl.  I would rate the pho around average, wished it had a few more noodles.  My friend ordered the N2 hu tieu and it looked great, but found a square of plastic in the middle of the dish after a few bites.  Talk about losing your appetite.  They did make a new dish, but did not offer a discount.  Staff was friendly, but not sure we'll come back."
9bIVU7I0GW8-GDQg7nIjGQ,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,3,"Stopped by this place because of the good reviews.  I ordered the tri-tip sandwich and the flatbread pepperoni pizza.  Unfortunately, the tri-tip sandwich was bland, tough, and had very little meat.  For the price I was quite disappointed.  The pizza was far better although it needed more cheese.  The staff was friendly and courteous, just wished the food was better."
szlK9dJSHeSACNYFO9tfwg,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"Been to this place a few times.  Usually I avoid it on the weekend due to the extremely long lines but since it was a holiday I had no choice.  When I put my name in I was told it was a 25 minute wait.  65 minutes later we finally got a seat.  I don't necessarily mind waiting but please try to be more accurate than that.  On to the food.  My party ordered the blueberry pancakes, ham I am, and a side of eggs and bacon.  The pancakes were big enough to feed a small army and from what I saw on other tables, they were puny.  Ignoring the ridiculous size, they were quite tasty and filling.  The ham steak was also delicious.  The prices seemed quite reasonable considering the portion size.  The blubbery pancakes were $7.99 and they could easily feed 2-3 people.  If you have time to spare, check this place out."
Gu8D1YoKErqVNNX00qkEaw,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"This place has a great rotating selection of beers.  They also have great food and beer specials.  Wednesday night is $3 most beers along with $0.59 boneless wings.  Both the boneless wings and chicken tenders are lightly breaded and have numerous flavors.  I highly recommend them for the price and the taste.  The place has several TVs showing various sitting events.  Check this place out, especially on nights where they have deals."
i0YtT1DXt3hbZUCw6z0Pjw,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,1,"I'm eaten at Dickies countless times, however I'm compelled to write this review based on trying a new location.  Warning, the menu has completely changed, portion sizes are smaller, and prices have gone up.  And the worst thing is that they no longer have French fries or any fried food for that matter and the ice cream machine is GONE!!  Also, the beef brisket sandwich is now completely plain, no onions or pickles.  I just feel like I was ripped off compared to the old menu, prices, and amenities.  I don't plan on ever going back ..."
ZBJm85DMnmTCRRHD9x4Ydw,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,5,"Best lunch value around at $4.32 for two slices and a drink, except for Costco.  Staff is always friendly.  Stop by on Thursday for the meat trio which is delicious."
zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA,_yNP6tJY6S_4PQJ3SzLvsw,4,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the valley.  I always order the Stromboli which is so large it barely fits on the plate.  I ordered it with pepperoni, bacon, and cheese and it comes with a side of marinara.  Mine was delicious as usual although my friend said hers had cold ham inside, yikes!  For dessert, I had the chocolate gelato with caramel and my friend has the tiramusu which was super rich and creamy.  I would definitely order that again.  The staff was very attentive and always kept my drink full.  I also hear the half price wine bottles on Wed night is a great deal!"
5pMNyj77S1P3rrT69y1pkQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"My office ordered three 20"" pizzas, a Stromboli, and cannolis for lunch today. This was our first time ever trying Joe's.

Of the six picky eaters in the office, everyone liked the food. The pizzas are huge with thin, slightly chewy crust, plentiful toppings, and just the right amount of grease. I didn't try the Stromboli personally, but my boss who is born-and-raised New Yorker said it was the best Stromboli she's had in Arizona so that is saying something.

The canolis were very tasty - not too sweet and small enough that you can eat one without feeling terribly guilty.

This is definitely a place we will be getting delivery from again."
80H8EnyShhq6_ZENH7aV3A,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"I purchased the LivingSocial deal back in June and finally went last week with a girlfriend who also enjoys Thai food.

My friend ordered the Spicy Basil with chicken with a heat level of 5. The waitress said that the heat level 5 was on par with the heat of a jalapeno. I feel it is safe to say that my friend would disagree with that statement since she normally eats things hotter than a jalapeno and she was sniffling by halfway through the meal. She said it was good, but she would stick with her usual Pad Thai next time.

I picked the Crispy Chicken with Spicy Plum Sauce with a heat level of 2 (My middle name might as well be ""Wimp""). The vegetables under the chicken had some light sauce that was deliciously light and tasty. The plum sauce was fantastic! The chicken was very tasty, but would have been a lot better if it had been grilled or cooked pretty much any way other than fried. The fried taste battles too strongly with the tasty plum sauce. Still very good, though!

For dessert, we both got the handmade Coconut Ice Cream. It was wonderfully tasty, but not really worth $4 since you only get one smallish scoop.

The service was very good although it was a little odd that my dinner came out five minutes before my friend's dinner.

I'm looking forward to a return visit to check out what else is good on their menu."
ufostEB8B3PC8treZ6FjlQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"We went by Craft 64 yesterday before the Giants spring training game. The atmosphere is great and the staff are very friendly, knowledgeable about the beer and wine selection, and helpful. We shared a pizza and a salad. The pizza was amazing and the perfect size for two people to share with the salad. A nice touch is that the salad ingredients were from a local producer."
gNXfe1et9eZ7ytIsQCHXog,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,The service is excellent and the menu is extensive. The chicken fried steak is delicious. They also serve mixed drinks like Bloody Mary's and Mimosas which is a nice touch.
uwDyxK92ae5kNjeZE8uCgA,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"I love this CPK. Their servers are always amazingly friendly, knowledgeable about menu options, and usually pretty funny. Their menu is extensive... something for everyone. My favorite is the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Salad and all of their pizzas are pretty good. Their seasonal soups are always fantastic too."
nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"Beautiful new building. Beautiful presentation. Excellent service.

Green salsa was delicious - if a little sweet - and had the perfect amount of heat for a wussy like me. Chips were good.

I asked for the Squash Blossom Soup ($6) which sounded mouth-wateringly good, but they were out. I went with the Baja Seafood Tacos ($10) instead - one with shrimp and one with salmon. They were ok - I've had better at Rubio's. Fruit salsa - pineapple and the other was mango - was very good though! Unfortunately, both tacos fell apart and I had to use a fork.

Husband got the Flying Saucer ($8)... looked fabulous and he said it tasted good.

The price seems high for the amount of food you get so be prepared!"

Atmosphere: 3 Stars.
Nothing to see here as this is your typical bar. TVs, bar tables, etc. This isn't necessarily a bad thing... just don't come here expecting anything more than a sports bar.

Food: 3 Stars.
Again, typical sports bar. I've tried two things at the Monk and I wasn't awed. I've had the chicken street tacos and the shrimp street tacos. The first time I had the shrimp tacos, they were delicious! The second time, the shrimp wasn't fresh and was very fishy. I also tried my husband's sandwich once (don't remember which one) and it was just OK. I've heard from friends that their wings are very good so maybe I'll check those out next time.

Drinks: 5 Stars.
They have a excellent draft beer menu. Varied selection and it changes with every visit. While my husband is enjoying an IPA from Michigan, I can be enjoying a Porter from Colorado."
Z-graJvcYCSOGWRs3bDzLQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"Much like the my review of the Old Chicago on Superstition Springs Blvd... The short and sweet review: Be in awe of the beer selection and stick to the pizza and some of the appetizers.

The longer review:

Beer Selection: 5 Stars! Seriously, how can you go wrong when you have 100+ beers to choose from?

Food: 3-4 stars. Average. There are some very yummy things on the menu like Italian Nachos, the pizzas, and some of the sandwiches, but then some things that should be easy (spinach artichoke dip, antipasti salad) are not good.

Service: At this location, we've only sat in the main restaurant once or twice. I don't remember the service so it couldn't have been bad. The service in the bar is generally quite good. So... 4-5 stars."
ad0LjmuXhUGBxTSkve5LZA,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"We do an ""ethnic dinner"" every other month and this month it was my turn. I am SO glad that I picked Beaver Choice because it was fabulous.

The place itself is tiny and food is ordered from the front counter. The kid that was taking orders was very helpful and a real sweetheart. The wait time is considerable, but as long as you aren't in a hurry, the food is worth the wait.

I ordered the Laxpudding with sides of broccoli, home made coleslaw, and dill potatoes. My friend ordered the Swedish meatballs.

I'm not sure what I actually received since it doesn't seem to match the description of Laxpudding from their menu. I think what I actually received was the Salmonburger & Skagenrora. It was very good, but I'm not really a salmonburger kind of girl. The topping on it was fantastic though!

The broccoli was delicious and perfectly cooked. The dill potatoes were also very good and holy cannoli, they are seriously DILL. If you like dill, try these potatoes.

My friend raved about the Swedish meatballs - even scrapping the plate with her fork to try to get any of the remnants. She said they were better than Ikea which since I've never tried them and she says they are great, I'm going to assume this is a high compliment to Beaver Choice's meatballs.

I got a Beaver Ball to go based on reviews on Yelp mentioning them. They were super chocolaty - I think dark chocolate? My husband swears there was coconut in them which he didn't like... I didn't notice coconut, but that doesn't mean anything.

I can't wait to go back to try other things on their menu... especially the Schnitzel which is what they are known for. Delicious food and excellent, warm service. Great place!!"
A6nY4SCrMuLPtlbq-EKnfA,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"Overall, I enjoyed my first visit to The Living Room with my sisters-in-law.

Atmosphere: 4 Stars.
I really liked this place. The place is very neat... garage doors that let the cool night air in and the little details of the place are cool.
The only thing that would have made it better is if they had some soft lighting after dark. It was so dark inside around 8pm that I couldn't read the drink menu.

Service: 1 Star.
I think this place might hire people more for their looks than their actual skills at service. Our waitress was scarce until it came time to pay the bill.

Drinks: 4 Stars. Pricey, but very good. I had the Red Sangria (blah! nothing special) and a peach martini. The martini was delicious and very strong which is a good thing when I'm paying $8 for it. I think next time I'll probably only have drinks here at Happy Hour. $8 for a small Sangria is a bit expensive for me.

Food: 4 Stars.
We started with two Bruschetta (steak and Gorgonzola; apple and fig). Very delicious! Next time, I'll probably stick to Bruschetta because they were so good. For dinner, I got 1/2 of a Prosciutto and Brie sandwich and a cup of Butternut Squash soup. The sandwich had one slice of fatty Prosciutto and a thin layer of Brie. Disappointing. The soup was EXCELLENT! If you like Butternut Squash soup, I'd recommend trying it here.

I'll be going back again... probably during Happy Hour next time!"
S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"My friend and I went to China Magic Noodle after buying the Groupon deal. The place was nice with plenty of tables and the service was prompt. Our waiter was very helpful in picking out the right dishes for each of us.

We started with the Spring Rolls which, oddly enough, came out after our entrees. The Spring Rolls were a bit of a disappointment... a bit too greasy and kind of plain in taste.

I got the Fried Noodles with Beef and my friend got the Friend Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. We each went home with a to-go box of over half of the dish left. The noodles were good - I had never tried hand-made noodles before and was pleasantly surprised.

I also tried the Honey Peach drink. This was very good if a bit sweet. I will definitely try another flavor next time since they have 5+ flavors to choose from.

Note: China Noodle does accept credit cards, but they prefer cash.

We'll be back!"
C6MG3vrloHF8h9PPvZNiJA,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"My friend and I stopped by this restaurant last month after eating at the restaurant next door several times and wondering about this place. We've know been there twice and it is my new favorite Thai restaurant.

The place is cozy and have unique salt and pepper shakers on each table which is a nice touch. The service has always been prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.

Our first time at the restaurant, we both had Pad Thai with fried tofu from the lunch menu. It came with salad with the most incredible peanut dressing. I literally could have just eaten the salad and been happy! Yum!! The meal also comes with a spring roll... all for $6.95! The Pad Thai was very good and it was some of the best Tofu I've had, but the portions were so generous that I only managed to eat half of my food. Not complaining! This is great.

The second visit, I selected the Mango Basil with chicken lunch special. I also ordered the house specialty drink, Thai Tea. Both were fabulous!! I never would have guessed that mango and basil went together, but it was amazing. I forget what my friend selected the second time around, but she also enjoyed her meal.

I've never been to Thai Patio for dinner, but you simply can't beat their lunch menu and pricing.

If you like Thai food and live in the East Valley, try this place out. I can't wait to go again! Just writing this review is making me crave it."
fKlr9qNoV37WQJwQ826POg,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"We went to Fogo for the first time to celebrate my husband's birthday after it was suggested by a friend. The experience was fantastic!

The service was the perfect blend of attentive and not bugging us. If we needed something, someone was there to get it for us.

The food was delicious. The meat was obviously the star at Fogo, but the salad bar was the best I've ever had... a lot of variety with a little something for every taste."
iBihgoxc6Ot7m2D4D3z0QA,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"We went to the Thirsty Lion for the first time on Saturday night. Having visited Maria-Maria prior, I liked what the Lion had done with the place. We were seated at a 6-top in the bar and immediately received service.

Thirsty Lion automatically got a good grade for me for having Rogue Hazelnut Brown on the menu. This is a personal favorite of mine. While the Lion brags of 52 taps, most of the beers are the familiar ones you will know if you like craft beer. There are a couple different types thrown in which is nice so you can try something new.

We ordered the Grilled Pear & Prosciutto flatbread appetizer based on the server's recommendation. It was delicious, but if there was pear anywhere on it, it wasn't on the pieces I had. Also, $9 is steep for an appetizer that size.

I ordered the Smoked Turkey Club for dinner with the Beer Cheese soup substituted ($1 upcharge) for the fries. The sandwich was fantastic - I will be getting this again! The soup was ok, nothing special. I'd skip it next time.

My husband got the Newcastle BBQ Chicken Pizza (added jalapenos) which was terrific. Dare I say it... even better than CPK's BBQ Chicken Pizza!? The crust for the pizza and flatbread is excellent.

The other choices for the evening for our party were: Pepper Bacon Cheese Burger (good), Chipotle Mac & Cheese (excellent! Restored my friends belief in getting mac & cheese from restaurants), and the Grilled Veggie Panini (good).

The service we received was excellent and our server obviously knew her stuff. We didn't have any questions about the beer selection as we were all familiar with the choices on their menu, but she was very knowledgeable about the best things on the menu.

Overall, good food, good beer selection, good service, prices are a little steep. ($6 for a 16oz beer!)"
3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"I've been to Rehab (the restaurant!) several times since they opened and have left happy and full each time. The place is very cute and relaxed with a beach and surfing theme. Every server we've ever had was excellent and attentive.

I've tried a variety of items of the menu:

* Hawaiian Burger  - It was tasty, but the slab of Ham on the burger was a bit much for me. Personal preference thing.

* Veggie Noogie Sammy - I incorrectly thought this would be similar to Oregano's Veggie Wedgie. It is not, but that doesn't mean it isn't good.

* Shelby's Shpinach Salad - This is my favorite with or without the grilled chicken breast on top. I love that you can get the mini size of this salad w/o chicken for only $5. It is a steal!

I've also tried the onion rings, french fries, and sweet potato tots. The tots are where it is at!

Most everything on the menu comes in two sizes - Rehab (small) and Relapse (huge). Even the small size is really big if you don't normally eat big portions. Be forewarned!"
gh07-uAHqmDZkj_u9rQHZQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"This is another place that is close to my work so I go here fairly often.

The service, almost without exception, is lacking. If I'm with a big group, the service is generally pretty good. If I come here by myself or in a group of two (which is usually the case), the service is spotty at best. One of the waiters - a blond guy - is really bad about forgetting about his tables. I think this might be because he is also the bartender...?

Anyway, the food is pretty good for a sports bar. I usually get either the Chef Salad (huge! and delicious), Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad (huge! and mouth-wateringly good), Bleu Cheese Burger (they drown it in bleu cheese so be prepared!), or one of their wraps (eh. nothing special). The salads are really where it is at because you get a LOT of food for a decent price.

I've also had their desserts once or twice. The strawberry shortcake is fantastic! LOADS of fresh strawberries... yum!

Quick Tip: Watch out if you ask for an additional dressing as they charge $0.50 for it!"
XThAmlwDIKoaG6IKrmuLyQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,5,"Last night was Ethnic Dinner night with my friend. We decided to try out this restaurant after I checked out the reviews on Yelp. Usually I'm a little wary of any restaurants with 3-stars or less. This time, I'm thrilled that we went here in spite of the 3-star average as it was fabulous!

The decor is cute... fishing nets with Christmas decorations, etc. It reminded me of a little dive bar in Rocky Point that I visit whenever I'm down there.

Our waiter was excellent, knowledgeable and patient as we asked loads of questions about different things on the menu. In the end, I couldn't decide between the crayfish po-boy and the alligator po-boy as I haven't had either meat before last night. I told the waiter to pick for me and he suggested alligator so alligator it was!

The alligator was amazing. I'm not sure if I can say it was cooked properly or not because I'm not sure how it is supposed to be cooked, but I can say the flavor of the meat was enhanced by the delicious seasoning it was cooked in. I only had one chewy/tough piece, but the rest was melt-in-my-mouth tender. The fries that came with the sandwich were also deliciously seasoned.

My friend got a grilled chicken salad with a side cup of the gumbo which the waiter highly recommended. Based on the fact that nothing was left on the plate or in the bowl, I'm going to say it was really tasty.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying the crayfish po-boy, the gumbo, the jambalaya, on and on. Their menu looks fantastic and I can't wait to try out more exotic items."
KwMe8zC9UoMXqxKcPYm5xw,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"For my husband's birthday, I wanted to treat him with something special in the way of dinner, so we made reservations at Shula's. I had mentioned in passing at the time I made the reservations that it was my husband's birthday.

When we arrived, we were escorted to a little alcove with a nameplate that said ""Happy Birthday"" on it. Very neat. Our waitress was awesome! We never had to ask for refills which is a huge thing with me.

For the food, mostly it was wonderful with one small exception (which is why this isn't a five-star review).

We started with the BBQ Shrimp (with stuffed basil) as an appetizer. It was delicious! Highly recommend this appetizer.

Next up, we shared a Caesar salad. We told the waitress we were going to share the salad so we were a little surprised when it was brought out to us on one plate with a spare plate to shovel half of it on to... why couldn't they have done this for us to spare us the mess on the table? Anyway, Caesar salad was tasty - not the best (see The Grapevine in Scottsdale), but very good.

For our entrees, I got the 8oz filet and the birthday boy got the cowboy steak - we both requested Medium which was described as a warm pink. My filet came out as a medium-well - no pink. Husband's steak came out a bit more on the red side than warm pink. Odd since we both requested Medium and they came out so different. Husband's steak was FABULOUS - deliciously seasoned and melt in your mouth bliss!! Mine, if it had been medium, I imagine it would have also been fabulous, but as it was, it was good. I decided not to send it back because I didn't want to have to eat it after Husband was already done with his dinner.

We also shared the crab mac-and-cheese side which was VERY good. I highly recommend this side dish. My only nitpick on it is that it was a little oversalted, but this might not bother others - I just happen to not like salt very much.

For dessert, they treated us to the 7-layer chocolate cake. Warning... this cake is unbelievably rich so prepare yourself if you order it. It came with a strawberry sitting in strawberry sauce. The only thing that could have made this better would have been if the strawberry sauce had been drizzled over the cake.

Overall, a wonderfully romantic dinner with my Husband on his birthday. Excellent service. The food was VERY good with the exception of the uneven cooking of the steaks."
r6cTbsmg4MhdHJnKWwefVw,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"I've been back three times since my first visit (and review) and my opinion has actually improved of this restaurant.

First, the water. On my first review, I said they serve Mesa tap water. Well, on each visit since, I've had water and it never tasted as funky as that first visit. Perhaps the water filtration system was acting up that initial visit.

In my three visits since my original review, I've had the following:

Eggs Benny California-syle which is your typical Eggs Benny, but with spinach and bacon instead of ham. It was very good! The portions were huge and I wasn't able to finish it which I was sad about since it was so tasty.

Pancakes with granola and fruit. There is actually a special name for this plate, but I can't remember what it was called. Maybe ""Healthy Pancakes"" or something like that. This was so good, but so filling! I wasn't even able to eat half of the plate. They were very generous with the fruit which I loved because so many places are stingy when it comes to fruit.

Drunken Chicken (again) without the bread... this is obviously turning in to my Go-To for Crackers. I love this lunch! This time around I got it with fruit on the side and was thrilled that Crackers uses an assortment of fruit - not just the usual cantaloupe and honeydew. There were berries, grapes, and all kinds of delicious fruit in a large bowl. Delicious!

I suppose it is no surprise that I will be going back to Crackers!"
0TBTV3q6QXCn9vNhy3Xi2w,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"I tried Cafe Lalibela (and Ethiopian food) for the first time recently with a friend.

I got the Mild Combination: yebeg alicha sega wat (cubed lamb), alicha sega wat (cubed beef), and fosolia (string bean concoction). The lamb and beef were fairly interchangable as far as taste, but both were excellent cuts of meat and the sauce they were in was very tasty. The fosolia (string bean) was not to my liking, but I think this is a personal preference as my friend tried it and liked it. Something about the seasoning just wasn't my cup of tea.

Speaking of tea, I also got a cup of Yekemem Shai (black tea with cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves). This not only smelled delicious, but it tasted fantastic. I normally sugar my tea, but I drank this one without sugar and it was all the better for it. I highly recommend this tea if you visit Cafe Lalibela!!

Also, the waitress was friendly and helpful when choosing off the menu.

I will be going back to this restaurant again! Good stuff."
BncSpY3IPix5s-4SOHCtLQ,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"Went for the first time last night. Atmosphere was neat... very hip. Our waitress was very good... we never had to ask for refills. I also like the fact that all the sushi doesn't come out at once - one roll at a time is perfect.

We ordered several rolls:
-Me So Horny (eh... 2-1/2 stars)
-Red Hot Chili Pepper (delicious!! 5 stars!)
-Yellowfin nigiri (succulent, melt-in-your-mouth fish... 5 stars)
-Spicy Crab Roll (good... 3 stars)
-Tootsie Roll (delicious! 5 stars)

We also had the Spicy Garlic Edamame. Yummy.

For drinks, we had the Plum Wine (4 stars - good stuff!) and three different kinds of martinis: Lemon Head, Lemon Raspberry Ice, Strawberry Blonde. The martinis seemed to be missing a key ingredient: Alcohol. How can someone drink two martinis and not even feel a teensy-bit buzzed? For $9.50/each, I think you should be able to taste the alcohol or feel it. Disappointing.

Other than the alcohol - or lack there of - we had a fabulous time. Great sushi, great service, great atmosphere. We'll be back!!"
plWuv4gda7m0KlqCNhrb4w,RRhJUH7p5TKs66ufVXHkzw,4,"I went to Angels Trumpet with my husband (G) last week for dinner and drinks.

For the most part, I really liked the place. It looks like an office building from the outside and from the inside, it looks like a cozy place to grab a bite to eat and a beer. Their beer selection is pretty awesome and featured on a chalkboard on the back wall.

I ordered the Fall Cider by Woodchuck and the grilled cheese sandwich dinner. The cider was delicious and perfectly chilled. The grilled cheese was SO good! I love the fact that they put mint on it - so unique and surprisingly tasty! The fries were not that great because they seemed to be a bit undercooked.

G's meal was a burger (if memory serves) and the ""chips"". He said they were both good.

So, what we both didn't like were the awful chairs. They are wooden slats and very uncomfortable to sit on for any length of time. The place was only about 1/4 full and we couldn't hear each other even though we were sitting directly across from one another. The place has to do something about the acoustics - it is far too loud to be able to carry on a conversation. And, the only other negative was the lighting. Instead of real overhead lighting, they have gone with tiny candles on the tables. It was too dark to read the menu unless you had it right up against the table.

Other than those issues, the place was great!"
thBWpIcP6vclsHS6GfI1dw,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,4,"A small group of us stayed at the Valley Ho for just one night for a friends birthday and I absolutly loved this hotel!! We stayed in one of the tower rooms and I just loved the decor. The room was big, had a small sitting area and the balcony. The bed (we had a King) was very comfy, although I am not a fan of feather pillows. The bathroom was awesome and had the biggest, deepest tub I've ever had in a hotel...2 people fit easily (wink, wink)! Our room was immaculately clean...I don't believe I've ever had a hotel room, especially the bathroom be so clean!

The only drawback for me was the pool and the reason I didn't give 5 stars. Not that it is the hotel's fault, but if the 20 year old Jersey Shore crowd is your thing, then you will love it. I however am a very fun loving 40 year old, and after about 1.5 hours at that pool I was ready to leave. Drunk 20 somethings making fools of themselves=not good...on the plus side it was some dang good people watching! The pool itself is small (consider when it was built) and with that many people lathered up with sunscreen, well you can imagine what the water looked like. Decent prices for drinks though, if you stick with their specials.

The bar was a fun place to hang out at before we went out that night, we did not try the restaurant, but have heard it is very good.

I would stay here again for sure for a girls weekend or special occasion!"
0CAzhX1w9qGD8iz4F8XZjQ,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,4,"This is one of my favorite places in downtown Chandler. Huge beer selection and they have a large menu of mixed beer drinks. The fish and chips are always a good choice and their cheese dip with pretzels is delish! I've had their wine burger as well and it was fantastic! We have always had great service that is prompt and friendly.

My only complaint is the smell. Another reviewer said ""mold maybe""...no I would say urine. We have been there several times and sometimes you smell it and sometimes you don't. The last time we were there we were taken all the way to the back near the hallway to the bathroom and I asked to be moved due to the overwhelming odor. We moved more to the middle of the bar and although you could still smell it, it was less so, but I smelled it as soon as we walked in. It is an old building, but none of the other shops or restaurants have that odor. OWNERS: please have this fixed as I can see it driving people away."
L8qHCpeeF2_5RN_5RJQyYg,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,5,"My favorite ""sports bar""! They have different specials and menus every night and my favorite is on Fridays...grilled fish tacos! The service is usually good, however depending on the server and how busy they are it can be a bit slow. We go there quite often and the wait staff that serve us freqently remember our usual drink orders...even the kids! The wings are great...try them ""grilled""! I can honestly say that I have never ordered something I haven't liked. Burger wise try the Alamo Chipotle burger! Other favorites are the Gyro salad, Jack not Jill Chicken sandwich, and the Lavosh. I always get either the jalapano slaw or sweet potato fries as my side. I've only had breakfast there one time out of all the years of going here, but it was very good too. Yeah, it gets loud, but that's only because it gets crowded!"
HPfcEJh3ivdX_QehRKZYrA,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,4,"The hubby, myself and our 11 year old decided to try this place out and had a great meal! I had the mushroom Swiss burger and it was seasoned well and was very juicy. Normally I ask for mayo for my burgers to add some moisture, but didn't have to on this burger. My husband had fish and chips with a side of Mac and cheese. Both were very good. The Mac and cheese was nice and cheesy! My daughter had honey BBQ wings and smacked them down. I managed to get a bite of one and they were pretty good.

The nasty comments about the wait staff by a couple other reviewers was unnecessary...could be toned down a bit, but no need to be mean!

We will go back again in the future I'm sure!"
8QYOnNLFTrpfPip44eMheg,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,1,"The family and I along with a couple friends decided to try this place for a little variety. The experience was less than stellar. If I could give no stars I would.

The Bad: Kids both wanted a cream soda (bottled) and when the waitress came back she informed us there was only one bottle left...really? It's soda for crying out loud. I decided to order a Kiltlifter (some special edition) and again....OUT! Now I'm slightly annoyed...Friday night, full house and by the way...also informed the kitchen is about 25 minutes ""behind"" so if we wanted to order an appetizer it would be best to put it in with our dinner order. Ok, whatever...we decided to order nachos. Nacho's came out STONE COLD, sent them back as they were inedible. The manager then came over (he was very nice, apologetic and again telling us the kitchen was ""behind"") apologized, offered to ""buy us a round"" (that didn't happen by the way even though we ordered a couple more rounds in the 2.5 hours we were there) and wanted to make sure we were ""happy"". Out comes nacho plate number 2, by the manager stating they were ""fresh out of the oven"". Not so much, again...STONE COLD ON cold plate. Ugh...didn't bother sending them back as it clearly was not going to do any good. So finally out comes dinner...everyone had yes you guessed it...cold food. By this time we just wanted to leave. So along comes the waitress, who is clearly annoyed and drops off the check....nachos included. Now one would think that if the manager came over, offered a round of drinks and apologized profusely about cold food and slow kitchen service that the nachos would have never made it to the bill. Needless to say we just paid and left...and will never return. Robert Irvine would be having a field day in this place! Total bill for a family of 4 for cold food and a couple beers: $78 (that included my barely deserved 15% tip (normally I go 20% all the way...not this time)

The Good: 1. Apologetic manager that seemed sincere, but clearly didn't follow through with any amount of customer service. 2. At least the beer was cold.

Save your money as there are plenty of other beer/sports bars with much better service and hot food. Can't believe this place had a full house!"
dNr7VKRti8dXWE-jzfVBtQ,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,4,"I've been here several times and really like it. I love the outside patio, but it's better suited for cooler weather as is the rooftop deck. The rescued bird are fun to look at, although there are a couple of the bigger ones that can get quite noisy, but hey...it's there home and we're visiting it!

Food: I've had their Prime Dip, which was very good although I'm not sure the pretzel bun is the best choice, but still good. The wings are very good, slightly spicy, but very flavorful. The fish tacos are also a good choice as is the citrus shrimp salad (large shrimp on top!). I have not tried the brick oven tamale, but my friend did and said it was excellent, it is however HUGE and you could easily share it! Appetizers: the meat and cheese board YUM and the pretzels are wonderful (who doesn't like beer cheese to dip in??) I've not tried the pulled pork sliders, but they look amazing (3 good size sliders, so you could have it as your meal).

They have a great selection of beer, some their own brews, but also many other local beers.

When busy the service can be a bit slow and the kitchen can be very slow, so that's really the only reason I can't give a 5 star. Overall a very cool place to hang out and enjoy our weather!"
go7g1fwoeg4a8JATkGzW0w,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,2,"My husband had been there a couple of time for wings and we decided to go there the other night. They were not busy at all, a few people in the bar. Our waitress was friendly enough, although maybe a bit shy. Waitresses are usually better and sell more when they are a bit more outgoing. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich with onion rings as a side and was less than impressed. I literally had 6 onion rings (the frozen kind, not fresh) and after each of my kids decided to help themselves to one, I had a huge void on my plate! The sandwich was underseasoned (the meat did not seem to even have been salted) and was so loaded with gritty cheddar cheese that it was difficult to eat. My advise...ditch the chedder and put on a nice white cheese like provelone. The peppers also did not have any flavor. We ordered some chicken fingers for the kids and I had a bite (since I only ate less than half of my sandwich) and let me say, I'm suprised my kid was eating them...they tasted like flour. I also tried one of my husbands wings (he had hot BBQ) and they were not bad. The hand cut fries were also good, although a tad soggy. If you are going to hand cut fries, why not make homemade onion rings too??? Considering that an order of onion rings was $7.50 on the appitizer menu, I would not have expected grocery store frozen rings!

We each also ordered a bloody mary and again...not good. The only spice was tabascco, no celery or other flavors at all. Again my advise...don't use regular tomato juice, use a good mix like Zing Zang. All the spices are already in it and all you have to do is add vodka, a splash of tobascco and garnish!

The waitress asked if I wanted a box for the other half of my sandwich and I wrinkled my nose and said no. To bad she didn't ask why I didn't want to take it home."
hf8WoI724TuDeAtH80bgPg,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,1,"Went here after work one night for dinner and a beer. Mistake...should have gone to Oregano's where at least I know my food will be good. First problem: our waitress, I'm pretty sure it was her first time ever waiting tables and as far as I could tell she only had the 3 tables in the very back corner by the bar and was completely frazzled. Lack of training?? Not sure really. Second problem: the food. I ordered a Juicy Lucy and was expecting the eruption of cheese from the middle of he burger. What I got was a hunk of cheddar that was barely even melted. I'm not a cook, but logic tells you that a half inch or so thick hunk of cheddar is not going to melt...how about using shredded cheese in the middle so it will melt??? Also the hamburger had no flavor and had probably sat for a few minutes (or longer since it took forever to get our food) as it was just luke warm when it came out. We did order the pretzels and they were good.

This place was packed, but I just don't see the draw. Lots of TV's (covering every inch of wall space practically) so if you just want to go watch a game and drink beer it would be ok I guess. Probably won't be back to eat, maybe for a beer after work, but I do hope the service would be much improved. Oh...and how about sporting some of Az sports team banners...Go Cards!"
vrKcFQPxj1Zzyj93yl-t6g,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,2,"Ok so I'd like to start out saying I've been to Top Golf a few times and have always had a good time hitting balls and hanging out with friends. The food is pretty good and I've always had good experiences with the host staff.....that was until my friend's 40th bday party on Dec 4th. There was a large group of us (4 bays worth plus some that did not hit any balls). My friend paid a pretty penny for this party with food and drinks included for everyone. The party was booked for 2 hours. 40 minutes before our time was up the staff started clearing away everything, including the drink tokens (again...prepaid) and food. We asked for to go boxes for the left over food and were told no, they don't give to go boxes (hello...already paid for food AND they do have to go boxes because I've taken my leftovers home from there before) due to ""health codes"". When asked to let us use the drink tokens, we were told that they called ""last call"". Along comes the ""manager"" gal who listens to the complaints and then promptly begins arguing with my friend stating that ""her staff is VERY well trained and asked everyone if they wanted to use the tokens (last call)"" This was a complete lie...not one person in our large party was told it was last call (again, 40 minutes before our time was up). I've never heard anyone argue with a customer the way she did. My friend was being very calm and asked her why they didn't come directly to her and inform her that there were tokens left so she could tell everyone. The manager just kept insisting that her staff asked everyone. Never offered a solution. So then along comes another manager, I believe his name was Shane, but I can't recall. Anyway, he was better at solving some of the problems and after learning we had planned to go to the bar there afterward (and spend more money I might add) he did offer to use the remaining tokens (I believe there were 9 in all...do the math on mixed drinks at say a minimum of $7) and did bring 2 buckets of beer to use at the bar. I can understand the ""party rules"", but I've never been to a place that starts cleaning up before the booked time is up and usually they ask the host if they would like the left over food wrapped up, after all it is paid for.

Would I go back...sure because it is a fun place, however I will NEVER book a party there and would not recommend it to anyone else. (I'd be surprised if anyone who attended this party would book one here). The main reason...the complete lack of customer service by the 1st ""manager"", she was horrible and was borderline belligerent. Might want to send her back to training, just saying."
VBVqHnViRLSYAqP7v8iNNQ,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"I really like it here. So surprised by all the bad reviews. I've come here frequently over the years and find the service to be consistently good and the food to be very good too. I tend to order the same things most of the time, but that's because I love them! The 'Boss' margarita is great. The chips and salsa are great. I have no complaints and am always happy to come here for dinner."
DMyoxEaTGTakZxWgh1D5bw,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,I really enjoy this restaurant and a huge bonus is the calorie limitation on the meals. I have been here many (more than 15-20) times and I have never had a bad meal. The service is always excellent. I love the small desert portions too - they are just enough and they are fabulous!
6nKR80xEGHYf2UxAe_Cu_g,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,4,"I think Tom's Thumb has declined over the past couple years so I'm taking it from 5 to 4 stars and I think I am being generous. The food is much more hit or miss. I still generally like it but for example, I am more hesitant to order the pulled pork because it is often fattier than it used to be. Some of the items I order used to come with sides and don't anymore. It was better when it was new."
_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"My husband and I had a great experience here. This is a big, open, loud place with a feeling of a lot of activity. There is a large bar in the center with projector televisions, and even the inside area has an outdoors feel. Not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner. The waitress told us there were four kitchens, so everything you order comes out at different times. We had a great server who seemed to have absolute perfect timing - was always there when we wanted something without being overbearing. The food is served tapas style, but the portions of most of what we ordered were actually pretty large and we ended up ordering more food than we needed. We got the edamame, the pomegranite guac, pork pad thai, and korean beef tacos. Everything was amazing. The drinks were also fantastic. I expected to like the place based on what I had heard, but it exceeded my expectations."
a6nZdebWiAZ97jync-vnGA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"I love this place. Probably come about once a month. The service is excellent. The atmosphere is great too. There is really nice outdoor seating and the heat lamps make it comfortable throughout the winter. We've had a lot of items off the menu from sandwiches to salads to fondue, meat and cheese boards, pizzas, and appetizers. Haven't had anything that wasn't good. I especially like the super food salad. Great seasonal beers too!"
AOEjA6yCT2htzQCfbPy7vA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,4,"I really like this place. I don't get burgers so can't comment on them, but they have some great salads and the turkey burgers are really good too. I love their sweet potato fries. I have always had really good service. It's nice to be able to sit outside with a glass of wine. I don't think you can go wrong here for a nice casual dinner."
M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"My go-to place for a special occasion. The seafood towers are incredible, the steaks are perfect and they make one of the best cosmopolitans around!"
odVKlMYqb4FHJXManv-VRA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,4,"I have been here a few times and it is good (I wouldn't go so far as to say great). The downside is that it is crazy busy at lunchtime and there are very few places to sit so unless you are getting takeout you may have to stand at the long counters near the bathroom to eat (which could have high chairs but don't). Also, it is definitely overpriced. Ten dollars is just too much for the lunch portion you get. If it was $7 or $8 I wouldn't feel so ripped off and would be more likely to return. I probably won't be back. I just don't think it's that fantastic to make it worth the price."
UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"The food and service here is always excellent. Nice casual and comfortable but upscale environment. On the expensive side, but quality and service live up to the prices."
gqEW_dPfTzMCP8DdLupl-A,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"I have been coming here routinely for years. You order at a counter and your food is brought to your table. The menu is really varied, the quality is excellent, the prices are reasonable for what you get, and the decor is beautiful for an (almost) fast-food, seat-yourself type of place. The staff are really friendly and service is good. I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"
BjbokieOGk2CCq2t8wV6MA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,Love this place. Great Italian food with homemade pasta. Nice ambiance with an outdoor patio. Service is good. Have been here four times and looking forward to going back!
dSnQTUJC0tCHadU1AGzvrw,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,3,"I've been here several times and the main attraction is the outdoor seating. It is on a golf course with beautiful views. The menu is not very appealing but whatever I finally settle on I always end up liking well enough. Still, before deciding to go we always wonder what will we actually be able to order? But then we go because of the patio and view.

Our servers have always been friendly and accommodating."
iwzVhM5CirzkNS5wTxwZeA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"I really enjoyed dinner here. Loved the ambience, which reminded me of being in NYC. The service was excellent as was the food. Highly recommend."
5BKP0DY4K79h9sd7THpeBw,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,4,"LAMP was very good. The staff was friendly and service was great. We got antipasta, a grape and gorgonzola salad and the Gem pizza for three of us to share. The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted good. It is a bit pricey but not unusual for the area it is located. The main reason for the four stars (rather than five) is I didn't like the food quite as much as some comparable places in No Scottsdale. I would definitely go again though."
si0aURvXxdwP04oJqkr_zA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,4,"This is a really good place to go for reasonably priced good Mexican food in North Scottsdale. The ambience is okay, nothing special and the service is inconsistent. Usually good but can be slow when they are busy. Overall a good place that I go back to repeatedly."
IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"Fantastic menu and service. Brought a group of 8 and we sat outside on the front patio. Our waitress was great and service was really attentive. The menu choices are really unique and everyone loved their food. We shared the Brussel sprout salad, which sounded a little scary to some but all loved it. The short rib tacos were amazing. Will definitely be returning!"
C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"Awesome fish tacos! You do not have table service here so you have to be in the mood for the type of place where you order at the counter and then sit at a picnic-table style bench (with no back). However, if you are up for that then you are set. The food is so good. The staff is very friendly too. If you have kids beware small portions. We've had to get back in line on two occasions because my daughter was still hungry (hasn't happened elsewhere) so now I encourage her not to order off the kids menu."
kR4NBNFf5SLpeAtZ-uPoPg,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"We have been coming here for many years and it is absolutely amazing. As soon as we discovered this place we completely stopped going to all the other local ice cream and yogurt places. This blows them all away. I was prompted to write this review after returning from Italy. Everywhere that I had gelato I compared it to That's Amore and in only one place (of many) did the gelato in Italy stand up to That's Amore. Love the owners, love the gelato!"
Y3aGrZR8QBlj8C2l7oEvDg,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,4,Everything seems just fine here. Our girl was cute and helpful. Bottles of wine are half price on Sunday. Mac and cheese was good but had some stringy unidentified parts and the nacho chips - they say they cook them here - were over cooked but edible.
h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,5,Mike the manager took great care of us although we asked for something out of the ordinary. The food was good. I had the flatbread and a margarita! I would suggest the seats versus the counter. The counter seems like sitting at a desk 3D was awesome.
_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,5,"Ya know what? There is nothing wrong here! What a meal. Denise was great fun and the stuffed rigatoni was delicious. Add some sausage and you have a great meal without the 45 minute wait for pizza.
We'll be back."
POO5_d0RwzjJVhIpN-oulg,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,3,"The food was great. Kobe was excellent but the scallops were a little overdone. We went on a Sunday night and our chef was tired from the weekend or so he said. No real show, nothing fancy, did a couple of tricks and we tried to jolly him up a bit but it didn't work. The only issue I could see to another night was the group seating. I must be getting old but if I am paying $50 a person, I don't want cranky, crying kids right next to me.  Not the restaurants fault but really!!!! Who takes kids that need high chairs to this kind of restaurant?"
f-7sTbx8u7c9t1-r_Fdoow,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,1,Really! This was not a nice place. I was ignored then treated rudely and don't know what the problem was. I finally left without getting anything.
zPQesAWNB_FuL2Be1pPPlA,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,4,We come here once in awhile and are not disappointed. The food is fresh and the folks seem to be around for a long time so it might be an ok place to work.  Love mushroom Monday.
xR1gLCH5resvtq1eV1nebg,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,2,Our server was just a cold fish. Nothing fun and exciting about this place because of her. Food was fine...if you can't cook a burger..... I think if we had a better server we would have been more impressed.
iPyhXWQ2LVSgBlQA4vqKJw,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,2,"A bit ignored tonight. Our server had a big party next to us and i felt sorry for them. She just dissapeared and since we came later we ended up stuck behind that mess too.
No refills, one quick trip back to check on us, no offer of dessert or coffee.
Just not a great or big plate of food for the price."
s1500k_u6yScouzQ-RUb6A,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,3,On our girls recommendation I ordered the crab. Not great....but polite and the rest of the meal was good.  I would go back. It had a pleasant atmosphere
_B3jnaQVtDXqydea1y92fQ,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,4,"Usually a wait but consistent food and of course you get to yahoo for at least one birthday every time you're there. Beware of peanuts. Tgey are additiv additives and fill you up. Wish they offered regular butter, the sweet stuff is over the top."
_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,4,"Enjoyed the food. Good flavor and although they say tapas, the portions were big enough to share.Took forever to get a second drink and we finally canceled it although the server kept checking back. All in all a good experience."
9E1q2uEMd881wnruicNTUA,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,4,"Really like a couple of the servers that we got - includung one of the bartenders.  Sure they still have a couple of glitches and the teriyaki is not great, but all in all a fun place to yell at the tv!"
_6mvQX9x66oz046eS5ii8w,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,4,Woo hoo Good traditional Mexican. I should have taken the last posters advise and got my geeen chili burro enchilata style! The salsa is spicy and they serve the drinks in a to go cup so you csn take it with you.
sAu9UJ5tvY6sc9Q_gcVV7Q,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,5,We love it here. The green sauce is fabulous and everything seems fresh and made to order....except the charro beans that have been cooking all day to perfection. I forgot to take a picture before I dove right in.
gugN1sgyheBJ6aKtNcv_gQ,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,2,"Not really impressed. I ordered bacon pancakes...right... they had jalapeno bacon in them and not just a little. There was too much to finish. If that was the way they served them they should have said so. Server apologized that everything took so long and then disappeared. I finally went up and got more coffee myself. They did not appear that busy and there were 3 servers on but everyone got crappy service as far as I could see. Maybe they have another dining room I don't know about that they all went to. When I complained about the jalapenos (she should have asked why I only ate half) she took it off the bill. The manager never came out, no one said anything when I got up to get more coffee. They might need to hire more help."
_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,3,"Came with the family. Had a great time. Food was ok.
The marinara was sweet. The bread was good though. The caprese salad was good.
They don't serve apple juice for the kids anymore. Gave them a bottle of fruit drink....10% juice ......"
dF11zSNDXbq6DBchUvqgZQ,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,2,"We used to love tbe Chipotles but now the meat has gone way downhill. I am hust not even sure what to say.  I can live with burrito blowout (it gets a hole and they wrap another tortilla around it) but crappy meat is the killer.
Please fix this!!!!"
e1i5mbYpFV8rQtfqtVwq3w,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,1,"Place was half empty but they were not seating anyone. When I asked if there was a wait she said ""normally or now?"" I said ""now for breakfast"" she said ""yes "" after pressing her she finally said okay we'll say 10 minutes. She was equally rude to the folks in front of us.  We turned and walked out."
JWsq_5AX1vDi-cG7iMJQCA,PgWXMFD4uS-n4i6n_o-RBg,5,We really like it here. The manager is always helpful and the food is made by you so how can it be screwed up! Taught the frenchie to eat off of chopsticks. He made a mess but enjoyed it just the same. Love the patio.
64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,5,"So I had bookmarked this place awhile ago (lol) because they had elote on the menu. YOU do NOT understand I've been craving this for several months. I'm from Cali so getting elote off the cart is not an issue. I've lived all 4 1/2 years in Arizona both Tucson and now Phoenix, I've never ran into the guy who sells them in Tucson and I've spent most those years in Tucson lol. So one day in Glendale, I actually run into the guy with the cart but only had a credit card and end up not getting any. I was then determined to get some and it's been a mission (still til this day haven't ran into him) so I figured to search on yelp and this place had been rated 1st or 2nd best for elote (google search) so why not? Now this place is my new spot. They have an amazing live music, that gets you jamming and in a good mood. The only down fall is that it can be a little loud so I don't really think it's a good idea for a date unless you sit outside (LOL, I would recommend for a second date or 3rd but definitely a good couple spot). The outside interior is real nice, like I even want to stay at the hotel just to see. The food is great, I got the carne asada burrito. It was good, it's not great only because it had that char burnt taste and it was a little dry but not to the point where I couldn't enjoy the burrito. Elote was great. My friend actually had the cheeseburger which was also good, I didn't say great because personally I love me some mayo on my burger like all the time. The fries were GREAT, lol I kept snacking on my friends. I'll definitely come back again and try their other menu options. It's not too crazy expensive but a little pricey and by pricey I mean like a little more than like your filibertos (y'all know what Mexican food chain I'm talking about :p) but you do get some great quality food. I would recommend!"
aTVssbSnSHOUitXjfyCWZg,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,1,"I don't understand how people can eat here. It's dry, it's bland, it's not appealing to my taste buds. I order the super seafood combo which included 2 pieces of fish, and 7 shrimps with fries. Honestly took a few bites of everything, I hate wasting food but however my stomach started acting up. I was slightly irritated that they charged for tarter sauce but gave me a ton of that red sauce which was gross. This place deserves 0 stars to be honest. I didn't think one could mess up frying fish but apparently they can. To be honest, better luck with Long John Silvers. I am still suffering from the food I ate but hopefully it'll pass."
x6qH9HXhzuKM03jcZmg-ZQ,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,3,"It was my first time trying out this place with a co-worker of mine, I will be honest..I did order something though I was not interested in eating but what I ate was the philly cheese steak (I believe that's not the name they have up there but similar ingredients :D). I originally wanted a meatball sub but however since I do have food restrictions with pork (Their meatballs are consisted of beef and pork), I could not order it and was pretty bummed. The sandwich I had was alright, I will definitely come back when I have a taste for subs. It was a little dry but not too dry, everything seemed to taste good."
P2GBKrx7dJg3xeGtuU2K-A,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,3,"Someone took me here for Vday since pappadeux was PACKED. I never go out on that day but wanted to do something. I tried oysters which I will never tried again at least raw, I like oysters in the can (lol). So much better than raw. I did try the grab leg and it was decent but not for the price. My sides where unseasoned as well. The sushi looked amazing, happened to snap photos of other people's food (was seating at sushi bar)."
lZ5rd3YxWTcCPJi45hvw7w,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,3,"I came here once and tried their chipotle steak it was yummy but didn't last long because within a month it wasn't even on the menu. Came there a second time and got a bowl, it's very small (maybe have the size of the chipotle burrito bowl :/) so it didn't fill me up. I preferred chipotles bowl over this."
eSENXDnnNSo-MLLkWJQ8Vg,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,4,"This was an interesting place. I was craving tacos and what's better than going to the taco shop. I tried one of their steak tacos and they were alright. Awesome salsa bar, never had strawberry salsa nor sweet pecan. It's a little pricey but hey guess that's the gourmet part. Will definitely try more items on the menu. Staff was very nice. I wanted a strawberry lemonade and since they only had regular lemonade the guy made me some and honestly wasn't bad at all."
QEwiYOst58ieW2GqTpsEag,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,5,"Rubios...gourmet fast food. I absolutely love the gourmet steak tacos and shrimp burrito. That's all I get because I don't need to be adventurous on the menu at times. I did try their citrus shrimp burrito and absolutely hated it, I had way too much citrus flavoring or whatever that was on my burrito. It tasted like I liked and ate the skin of the orange."
Sn4P9faQE6wZvK-WI4fRHg,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,3,"TGIF used to be the BUSINESS. I remember way back when when they had the tower of wings and they had some bomb wings that tasted like the miso but better (or maybe they were the miso wings back then) either way..I liked the miso wings better than the buffalo wings. I know I'm picky with my buffalo sauce but this one had a strong bitter flavor to it. My friend enjoyed the buffalo wings but personally I didn't eat a full wing because it wasn't that tasty to me. I ordered the cajun chicken and shrimp, it was surprisingly pretty tasty. Had enough kick for me not to add hot sauce. My friend ordered the fajitas which came in a pretty decent size order."
JR2ma-JU1CO_xVD_p5-RPw,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,2,"I love crab, I've always near the ocean so when I came to Arizona and wanted crab..well we had this. I didn't like it that much, it was expensive and felt like a snack. I got the 2 for $40, and it wasn't enough. I've tried their apple crumble like thing with cinnamon ice cream, it was very sugary. I couldn't taste my sprite."
KMxOoHyRKP74PgosuRkkdg,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,1,"I discovered this place while driving to Long John Silvers, don't get me wrong, I love that place but I changed my mind last minute and ended up here. As I go through the photos on yelp, I seen that they had elotes (Mexican corn on the cob) and was excited! (Also their tacos looked good) but I got the super nachos and the corn in a cup. What a disappoint that was! The corn in the cup was super runny and soupy, the cashier asked if I wanted lime and I was like sure but however there was too much. The lime flavor with the soupy crumble cheese corn on the cup was a turn off and that's surprising because I believe the ""recipe"" of the corn is simple, too simple to mess up yet I was proven wrong. This is the first time  I was actually dissatisfied with corn in the cup that I only took 3 spoonfuls. Even in Los Angeles at the Garment District where they have street food and the corn in the cup, it isn't made THAT watery. After that I was hoping the Super Nachos would redeem this place but it turned into a flop as well. I did notice the Nacho Cheese machine but still went with it anyways because I never really experienced anything bad from that machine nacho cheese. I stress about the nacho cheese (lol) because it did leave a nasty after taste, you would only experience this after taste with cheap cheese. They could of least hooked it up with whatever cheese they use at Taco Bell, come on now. However the steak was good and the guac was good on the nachos, I was pretty much hungry at this point so I split the nachos in half and ate them regardless. We ordered 2 corn in the cup and nachos (she says it can feed 2 but..I think 1 person) 2 drinks, came put to 21 dollars...I wish I could go back and change my mind to continue in route to Long John Silvers. I believe this place just opened so maybe in the future I will come back and try their tacos."
ZOj56SAgGoFs6ymO-n672g,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,4,"Lenny's burgers is pretty good, it's a few upgrades from Mc Donald's but not as good as SmashBurger in my opinion. The burger taste like if you were to make it on the BBQ which I like. The fries were good and the fried mushrooms. :) Will definitely get another burger if I can't get to Smash."
-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,3,"Eh, what can I say? I had the pesto chicken fettuccine and my company had gotten the lasagna. I did not get to try the lasagna because it had sausage in it and I don't eat pork. They said that they would give it 2 stars. However for my dish I would give the same, it was pretty bland. They had no salt and pepper at the table so I couldn't have fixed it. I took it to-go to fix it later. I also got the cannoli, I've had better. They added like cinnamon to their cream, not like what I'm used to in Little Italy in Boston, MA."
jcw_vtqfZSTLP15DJmvfIA,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,3,"This place is only getting a 3 star because our waiter was awesome!

It's hard finding a breakfast place that doesn't just only serve pork breakfast items but turkey as well. I ordered eggs, hash browns, turkey patties and toast also was craving something sweet so also ordered the Big waffle with added strawberries and whip cream. Everything looked good but I did not like their Turkey Patties, it had this interesting flavor that I will try to describe. The turkey patties tasted like they had been frozen then defrosted but not all the way cooked, I actually went to have breakfast with someone and they ordered the same thing and also didn't eat the Turkey Patties. Maybe it's the brand they use or could be the cook but I could of made better using the turkey sausage patties at your local super market (The Jimmy Dean Brand). The strawberries on the waffle were soggy but that's okay, they did taste like they had been soaking in sugar for several hours so your taste buds were going to surely wake up with the sugar strawberries. Maybe I'll give this place another shot, who knows.

Ps: they have interesting flavors of lemonade that was Delish."
BBbdKmZwbMQSkcL3h1CC2w,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,5,"I personally prefer this over in n out, the smash fries are to die for! I love the October breast cancer awareness shake it's a raspberry sorbet milkshake which should be put on the menu because it's banging. I think their Oreo milkshake is runner up to the raspberry. Their burgers are filling especially if you get them ""big"" it's light but liking, if that makes sense. I feel that in n out burgers are packed with stuff and can be overwhelming at times. I definitely will stop at a SmashBurger if they are around me."
RSuT0SK4XpsIAZtdP7Lf3w,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,4,"I think it was good, the red meat special tamales are AMAZING. I, however, had the mini appetizer which consisted of 3 mini tacos, 3 mini toastada and 3 mini burritos. The salsa they make isn't that good for them to be selling it to take home but that's IMO."
I4tp53A6qj6m_TXcwhBhqw,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,3,"I wanted to go to creations which is next door but ran into this one and decided to try it. I had the bit zee red chili skillet with a short stack and my company have biscuits and gravy with bacon and scrambled eggs. My skillet was good for something that was simple, definitely filling. I had craved pancakes and tried their pancakes despite the fact I don't like pancakes that much. They were ok but soothed my sweet craving. My company said their sausage gravy is amazing and the bacon was cooked perfect. I, however, don't eat pork products so I couldn't tell you myself how it tasted. I was bummed out that they ran out of apple juice, that was my go to breakfast drink. The other people that were at the establishment had been very loud, obnoxiously loud. Our waiter was very impersonal and seemed like she didn't like her shift. She didn't send off friendly vibes but food was great."
E4JyAzB5_2quptwtemyhYA,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,5,"Absolutely in love with this place and their San Francisco French toast. Like I love french toast but the one's here, OH MY GOD! I can't begin to describe what it taste like but if you are against sweet flavors then you need to skip over this glorious option and choose something else off the menu. This is no ordinary french toast. It's fried, weird looking but delicious , did I mention massive? 1 slice would do just fine and that says a lot coming from me because I love to eat. Apple Juice is fresh with the little brown stuff settling at the bottom of your cup. Hashbrowns are great. Omelette is great! Service was phenomenal (they even walk around sometimes serving free baked goods). I've tried this place a few times and it has never failed me once, best breakfast place I've ran into in Phoenix."
peH054eonSBTLLC5aFOQ0g,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,4,"I watch Adam on ""Man VS Food"" and just everything he tried so yummy so I was more than pleased to see he tried this place. I'm a sucker for how they describe items on the menu and ended up trying a few dishes. I've never tried a kosher deli but it didn't hurt to try. I don't eat pork and they had a few other options unlike most breakfast places that don't have any other options of meat or no meat. The French toast was out this world...absolutely mind blown! Salmon dish I opted for was alright, too many capers do take away from the dish and gives it an overpowering taste unlike a subtle one. Will have to try other dishes on next trip!"
q1R2R9i3TkH94x-CwP-l4w,Oqfi3b_FQP4izygPamTnuw,4,"Was rolling around Phoenix trying to decide what to eat, being torn between Mexican food and burgers (was really trying to find a mexican restaurant that served Elotes) and it was getting late so me and my friend picked this place. He raved that his boss went here it was amazing and that did serve Elotes (Sadly, they do not...I asked -insert sad face-) so I jumped on board. The place was busy when we came but there was no wait, the waitress was very understanding when we decided to switch our seats from indoor to outdoor seating after already placing an order on appetizer menu. The chips and salsa that was served were addicting (finished 1 bowl and a half) while I scanned through the menu..still undecided. We decided to try their mexican pizza, half chicken..half beef..this was so freaking good OMG! (if you ever tried Taco Bell's Mexican pizza its 100x better). Honestly would be happy if it was an entree, it definitely can feed 2 people. I ordered the 3 amigos which comes with 3 different types of enchilada, rice and beans. I personally LOVED the chicken/spinach enchilada doused in this yummy white sauce.
Margaritas are served in a huge glass for those who enjoy them, check it out. I ordered the virgin Pina Colada which was eh..honestly couldn't finish because I was getting full and it didn't taste that good in my opinion but maybe that's because I ordered it without the rum..

Definitely wanting to explore their menu some more."

It makes me sad to have to say it -but good food or not, it's getting awfully frustrating to go here!"

Delicious food and good service!"

I had the chicken kebabs and they were good. The best part of the meal though was the rice.

Servings are huge. I took the rest of mine to go and had lunch AND dinner the next day!"
0ihQJhd_-nUP1p01NBDjLQ,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,1,"Wow. Sorry I tried to help. The last thing I was expecting from a 3 star reviews (that pinpointed exactly what could be improved on) was being attacked, blamed and not believed by the owner (see comment by business owner below).

If you can't take constructive criticism well from your own REPEAT customers then how can I feel confident that next time I visit your business that I would have more than .0002 seconds to look over the menu or I won't have to eat watching an employee using her cell phone (that I doubt she washes every times she uses it) in the front of the house. If that is going on in the front then I don't want to know what nastiness if happening in the back?

Blaming a customer that requested time to actually be fully in the store before asking what she wants is completely unacceptable.

So Business Owner let go of your ego, stop attacking customers that give three stars and perhaps listen to us.

I won't ever go back. I have updated my review to a one star because of the ill response I received from the owner.

I'll go spend my money where my concerns or suggestions are appreciated."
JIETwXSEGIHMNyxZVEnNKQ,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,1,"This review is solely for the employee whose name tag read ""syd the kid"". On Friday she wore a purple headband.

She is by far the worst restaurant employee that I ever came across. My supervisor (my supervisor is well known aka a public figure I won't mention who she is) and I came in for a mid-morning break. We both ordered smoothies and we both had horrible experiences.

Syd the kid coughed into my cup while she was writing my name on the cup. I demanded a new cup and she was like ""why do you want another cup"" and I said cause you coughed into it. She rolled her eyes and got another cup.

At this time a few customers recognized my supervisor and was asking to take photos with her which held up the line. Finally supervisor ordered her drink. As the others who were starstrucked to see my supervisor went away someone behind the counter asked Syd the kid if she knew who that woman was. Syd the kid said ""who knows. Probably a stripper"". wrong Syd!  Why don't you read the news a bit more often before making a complete fool of yourself. Even sadder that she knew her name (for the cup) and she has a very unique name that even if you couldn't recognize her by face at least do so by name! Supervisor heard and had this look of disgust on her face. Great impression of old town she must have had!

We both had the piña-kale-Ada which was okay. Didn't taste organic."
6ySrrRnMB_vb1oTroNFD4A,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,1,"Rude! I work nearby and come ever so often and each and every time that staff has been extremely rude to me.

It could have easily been my favorite coffee shop in the area (I rather support a local business than a national chain) but at least when I go to a national chain I know i'm usually getting excellent service."
h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,4,A cheaper version of iPic. You get to choose your seat when you purchase your ticket. More comfy seating than your average theatre. A bar to enjoy a pre movie drink. The food is subpar. Think Applebee's quality. Other than that I always choose this theatre if they are showing a movie that I want to see.
fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,3,"Please stop it with the attitude. I asked for an ""iced coffee"" and barista said:  ""do you mean iced toddy?"" Umm..sure whatever. Just get me some caffeine with iced over it.

Oh and don't ask for skim milk if you don't want a lecture.

I used to go here often since I like supporting small businesses but now with all the new coffee shops opening up in the area I will be supporting them instead."
lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,4,"Pricey for street tacos ($3 each--WTF??) but they are as good as you can get in Scottsdale.  I was actually quite surprise since I don't normally hold ""2am drunk food in the club district"" to high standards but these tacos are really good even when you are sober.

The chicken is my favorites."
sKrlmbrZWCyLIgiMihCPqw,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,5,"I am so happy that they moved closer to me. I've been a patron at their Central Ave location since forever but was always a pain to get to. I love their cocktails so to prevent any DUI it was always a $30 cab ride each way. No longer thanks to this new location!

The cocktails are good. The food is always delicious. I love the curry bowl, veggie burgers, tacos basically you can not go wrong with anything on the menu. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options."
wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,1,Horrible service. Felt rushed. Gave us a check before we finished eating and before asking if we wanted anything.
PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,5,Never had something I didn't like. Veggie burgers and the breakfast pasta are my favorites. Does get very loud in the evenings which is not my liking (I'm getting old)

Word of advice: get rid of all the gimicky advertisements including the sign for the casino. Make it into a french cafe NOT a billboard in Times Square."
QlJztL2aGEXgejgi5JM9Xg,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,5,"This review is solely for their bar.

I love fruity, tropical cocktails and Tommy Bahama's never fail to disappoint. Whenever I come here I feel like I am on vacation. They have an awesome Happy Hour--half priced cocktails. The happy hour appetizers that I had were the tacos, coconut shrimps and the 3 dips. All were yummy."

Fresh fish flown in. Lots of non-sushi authentic dishes (try the Dynamite. You're welcome) and an impressive list of sake."
zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,5,"Only been here for breakfast but let me tell you this place is amazing! If you looking for a big plate, greasy breakfast to help with your hangover this is not the place for you. If you looking for a lighter, healthier meal to give you energy to start your day then go here!

They have a small, limited menu but don't let that turn you off. With a small menu they are able to perfect everything on it. I never left disappointed. The egg Benedict is one of the best that I ever tasted. I also love their breakfast sandwich.

I want to try their dinner options."
J07TDs6qnTIaxm48EL1cKQ,z82b6JZqZVO0sVJFEhunIw,4,"The jungle curry rice bowl is absolutely delicious. Actually all of their rice bowls are great. Also love their tacos, veggie burger, sweet potato fries and all of their tropical drinks."

kYATtIsqVEoawS47UcSlDA,o5HQN7Y9wv2SkJkR-TJS9w,5,"Fantastic!!!!!! Ia couple of weeks ago I ran into their name again and realized that they were at the Ahwatukee Farmers market (Sunday's).  I  had seen them in central Phoenix but did not try them that day.   I tried Short Leash dogs that Day (fantastic also).

So... I gambled and told my wife and son that I had a surprise for them. Took them the the farmers market. Grabbed a great cup of coffee at the market an then walked around the corner and found trucking!   AWESOME was the words out of the three of us.   Today is Saturday and also planning on getting up early to great another crepe tomorrow!

Local entrepenuers, great food... You must support!  You will not regret it!"
AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg,o5HQN7Y9wv2SkJkR-TJS9w,5,"Just returned from a memorable dining experience.  We live in Ahwatukee and have been trying to occasionally make it there for the past few years.  But never seemed to be able to get a reservation within a few days of the desired reservation.   Now, I understand why.  Now, i am upset that i did not try harder to dine at Kai!  Definitely a fabulous dining experience.  My last similar experience was when Mary Elaine's still existed at the Phoenician.

The Duck plate was stupendous. The escargot was bursting with flavors.   The squash puree was unbelievable.  And I could continue on...  If you are not a so called foodie, you will think this place is priced too high and or not enjoy the nuances of each course and plate.

The service was fantastic down to the thank you card waiting for us in our car!   I had given up many years ago with finding this type of food and service in the valley.

Our hats off to the chef and the staff.  We will be back!!!"
MbAsfN3wwV22K7GZsgcBqA,o5HQN7Y9wv2SkJkR-TJS9w,4,"Well...  we were doing the typical ""where are we going to eat in Ahwatukee"" routine.   Not a lot choices.   We started bouncing ideas with our friends...   We came up with Mucho Gusto...  I did a quick search to find the number  and came across this site.   I was shocked to see such opposing reviews...

We end up there last night.   It was probably the best meal I have had there...

Words of advice...  If you are looking for traditional commercial Mexican food... THIS is NOT the place...   If you are looking for a cheap Mexican restaurant, THIS is not the place.  Yet, I do not find Mucho Gusto much higher than any other  sit-down restaurant.   Food is much much better.

My wife and I have been frequenting the restaurant for years. I have always had a good to great meal.   Yes, the menu has slightly changed, not a bad thing for any restaurant.  No, the ownership has not changed.   The Hibiscus Margarita's were awesome!!!. The pork flautas were GREAT!!!  Six of us, all our dishes were great!!!

Service was a little slow.  Waitress was VERY personable...   They were a little understaffed but everyone was very personable.  I have had a little attitude in the past from college waiters/waitresses.  But the food always ALWAYS made up for it.

I highly recommend this place...   Not many ""good"" Mexican restaurants here in the Valley.  Some my other favorites:  Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, Blue Adobe in Mesa,

Enjoy!"

9Cq_NVvWZOEAzmE7tqJgmg,o5HQN7Y9wv2SkJkR-TJS9w,5,"Last week, my wife were in Austin for an event over the weekend.  We walked around downtown and ran into a couple of food trucks.  We had a po'boy that was out of this world. Thought what a great idea...food trucks.  Low overhead for the owner, great food, cool dining experience with a local chef with the passion to serve great and unique food!

Now, a week later, back in Phoenix...  I am getting out of a meeting with my stomach grumbling and trying to figure what to eat.  So I hop in my car and now talking to my wife and asking where I can grab something that I have not tried in the downtown area...  She says ""...do not know..."". Then I see the food trucks!  I say to myself ""you have to stop, these are local entrepreneurs that deserve at least a shot!"".

Boy... Was I blown away!  I had a hard choice to make between the various food trucks...  I chose Short Leash. I was going to order the the Chicago-style dog. Because, if you knew my wife's family, anything else would be blasphemy!

I asked the recommendation of the owner between the Chicago-style and something else on the menu.  He recommended the Aiko that had mango chutney and jalepenos.  I took his advice!   He then called my name when the dog was ready...  Sat down... Unwrapped it... And was blown away with the presentation, the flat bread, the whole combination!  They even had the ""Mexican"" coca cola made with cane sugar.

Needless to say, I was blown away! Now, I have to take my wife there, probably kicking and screaming because she is a traditionist when it comes to hot dogs.  But I know she will love it!

BTW, they have a FB page with locations and times where they are at, enjoy!"

Was pleasantly surprised with the Nachos, not the typical Nachos, almost like a Chilaquile.  They were great!   The shimp appetizer looked fantastic.   The drinks were good!    Will reserve the 5 star for when we can make it to dinner there since we live in Ahwatukee.  Definitely stop by."

I have been to places like Roka Akor (delicious) but at $100+ a person... Not something I want to do every time I want sushi.  sakana's is a great place also in Ahwatukee with a little livelier place. Tried Sushi Eye the other day shortly after they opened... Will have to give them another chance.  RA's would not bother unless you think California rolls is ""real"" sushi.

Sushi Ken is a great neighborhood restaurant.  Will definitely go back."
Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ,o5HQN7Y9wv2SkJkR-TJS9w,1,"Well this review is not about the music... Nor the food... Or anything you would expect in a review.   This is to document an outrage that transpired last night shortly after an art event to kickoff Art Detour showcasing local Latin Artists at this establishment.   The outrage was not from any of the patrons but from two specific employees.  First, one of the bouncers and then the second from the manager.  I can unequivocally state that this has been the most distasteful, disrespectful, and rude behavior my wife and I have experienced in our lives.

It started when the art event concluded... Which my wife was one of the principal organizers.  As the change over began for normal business, my wife and I decided to stay and experience the venue and enjoy the company of the various artists and supporters.  Well... At a certain point, one of the bouncers approached us asked if I had a wrist band.  We identified who we were... This is when the rude and disrepectful behavior began.  We were then asked to leave and escorted out because we did not have the right wrist band.  We all encounter rude behavior at some point in our lives.  We asked him to verify with the principal organizer and his management.  But where both my wife and I lost it is when we were told by the bouncer that we we singled out because we were speaking Spanish!  REALLY?!

Well... Needless to say, I will NEVER  step foot again In this establishment. And yes, I will make the statement that we were racially profiled.   Never thought I would ever have those words come out of my mouth even in Arizona.  All the reteric about Arizona showed it ugly head at this establishment.   What then made matters worse... The manager got involved. Publically being singled out because we spoke Spanish...  And then having a manager not even be willing to acknowledge the wrong doing of one of her employees.  Not even a simple apology.  UNACCEPTABLE AND WRONG,

As a Latino in Arizona who contributes to the community and cherishes our diversity...  I cannot be accepting of this type of behavior nor should any other self-respecting human being."

Food was very good and could see the Richardson's influence.   Service was good, owner was attentive to ensuring we were comfortable.   I did not know this place existed until we were invited by some friends.  Definitely will be back.   Only a couple one misfires...   but was taken care of immediately when brought to their attention.   True test will be next time I visit.   Yet, I would be surprised if the misfires were not correct by next visit.

Meal was very good.  Small wine list but the Cab that was available went well with our dishes.   Crab cakes were AWESOME.   Glad to see a restaurant of this caliber in the 'Tuk.

I had the Pork Cheek Pot Pie, mmm.   My wife had the Fried chicken and was SO good!   The braised beef was TENDER.

Drinks went perfectly with our meal.  I had the ""fresh"" grapefruit vodka drink.  My wife kept getting the ""bartender's"" choice.  She loved all three of them!

We finished off with the donut dessert which was to ""die for"".

rJdEbOWNfAELa0YETWf9Lg,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,4,"Deseo was amazing , food and service was wonderful. It will not be our last time there."
pwablDuLsQOdpHAEcNFtww,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,4,"Our server was great. The food was good, we ordered the bacon shrimps and it was average for the price. The mojito drink was good. We will go back! And the fact that they have games on their iPad for kids for $2 was pretty clever."
hPfszfTC6xu9Ysd3sIHm8Q,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,2,Huh not good. Nice and clean place but need lots of improvement on food. Shrimps tempura was a 1 star!
0bF6jv97Z6VbruRpepUOcw,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,4,We had a great dinner! It's amazing how much food we got for a very reasonable price. The filet mignon was a 4 stars. Surprisingly there was no music background but the atmosphere was pleasant. The staff was kind and attentive. The creme brûlée was a hit! We will defitnely go back :-)
kv42obrz682yqpNy0yxrUA,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,4,Nice cozy place! We love coming here with our bikes and having our breakfast. Their leather sofas are so comfortable.
eDlgbI0Qg_mmI-Osvci0gw,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,4,I love their fried calamari. The beef sliders are too dry. I will go there just for that. The place is lacked of ambiance but great Happy Hour for all summer!
Se63tFm5tLlO5wuUlyww8Q,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,1,We used to come here few years ago and the food was not bad..we decided to go back last night and this place is going down hill. We will definitely have to cross this restaurant out of our list.
3HrT5IcO3sd4pSBCFP4OYw,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,2,Fried wontons was a 1 Star..i gave Orange Chicken  and braised tofu a 2 1/2 stars..service was ok. Over all it was médiocre food..
7ra_3K_ZebXNjMpaC6yVow,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,3,Beautiful view on a golf course! But the sushi was not amazing . They have a live band which is nice but the service is fairly slow.
iZMdwe0xebE3rF0x3LOr4w,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,3,"I got the chicken banh mi and I thought that the chicken was lacked of seasonings.. Blunt , no flavor. The carrots and white radishes are too big but the bread was good.
The egg rolls are not my favorite. I had the best crispy rolls at Angelina Pho.
Otherwise, the place is clean and that's a plus."
2Gh1Etnpn_BDy72hOXmCtg,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,2,I had some wonton soup which is one of my favorite meal but the stuffing did not have shrimp inside of the wontons and the broth was good but I wonder if they put some MSG in the soup.
MmQsPiVSN08WtmlsC_ZSVA,GwDdQUZzbOgNbxp3oawsGw,4,Best steak tacos we ever had..tasty and big portion. The chicken tacos is kind of dry. We love to come here. Prices are very good..highly recommended
oO5jC3tOmvIy7JDExKYl2g,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"I've been to this location quite a few times. When I am in the mood, I love their food. I recommend the roadies. They are sliders served on the rolls they serve at the beginning of the meal. Yummmmm. Last time I was there, we also ordered the appetizer combo. That was fabulous as well.

The service isn't memorable, never great but never bad either. The keep your drinks full and bring your food quickly but nothing exceptional.

So far I have received decent service and delicious food. If you'd in the mood for roadhouse type food, make a stop here!"
qFqueIKCVF5PlXmjl1YY9Q,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"I went with my friend to Frost last night. I've been to several gelato places before and I went to Italy a couple years ago and treated myself to gelato every day... so it's easy to say I'm a fan of gelato.

When we walked in, we were greeted right away. The super friendly gelato girl gave us the run down of questions: have we been to frost before, have we had gelato before, the perks of gelato over ice cream and getting samples is recommended.

They have more of a selection of flavors than any gelato store I've been to. Each flavor is decorated to make them even more appetizing. The gelato girl gave great recommendations and we settled on the tiramisu and salted caramel. They were both amazing.

The price is a little steep but for a treat once in a while, it is totally worth it. Also, with gelato a little goes a long way. That is why they give you the baby spoons with your cup.

The decor is very modern and the shop looks spotless. The owner put a lot of time and work into their shop and it shows. They even come about with cups of water to their customers. This was a nice little touch to show they care.

I will certainly be back with my boyfriend soon. It's a great location just outside the main strip of the mall."
w2gXToEf9ba78Qfmp42YRQ,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"I am not a huge fan of their food but their service is spectacular. All the employees I've encountered are incredibly friendly. I usually don't order food; I just pick up a lemonade. I LOVE that lemonade! But if you are ordering food, the chicken sandwich is doable."
y3bMutme81x4PUhb0zaC_A,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,3,"My original review of this place was very good. I have decided to edit it because since posting the review I haven't received the best food. The last few times I've come here, the soup was only luke warm. Nothing is worse than cold soup (OK, maybe a few things are worse...) I have a rule that I will never send food back because of fear that the servers or kitchen staff will do something to it. Instead I just write reviews on here. The soup was my favorite part of coming to Dilly's Deli. I was obsessed with the creamy chicken noodle soup so I am a bit disappointed in Dilly's for this.

The sandwiches though are consistently great. All ingredients look and taste very fresh. I get the Dilly Bird. On my own, I would never put cream cheese on a sandwich but it is a great compliment to the other ingredients on the Dilly Bird.

I would recommend giving this place a shot but don't be surprised if the soup isn't hot."
r0rtl4OsZy-F099jeO_DKA,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"My mom and I stopped by for a late lunch yesterday. The menu and the food were the same as other Paradise locations. This location wasn't nearly as busy as the others which provided a nice and quiet meal for my mom and I. The onlt downfall was that I have experienced friendlier staff at the other locations. But overall, it was a decent dining experience.

The thing I love about Paradise is their consistency. The food always tastes the same each and every time. And I have yet to find anything I don't like."
l2Gfm3CA20iCBCBt_GNdDA,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"I love this place. It is my go-to place when I am in the mood for the Italian.

So far I've had the gnocchi with vodka sauce (my favorite), pizza, eggplant parm with spaghetti and the chicken parm sandwich. All four have been delicious. The portions are large so I always eat half at the restaurant and save the other half for lunch.

The service is also wonderful. Every server I've encountered in very polite and attentive.

If you are in the mood for some filling food, this is the place to go. I highly recommend it!"
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"I've been to Four Peaks many times over the years for lunch, dinner and drinks and I am consistently satisfied.

Their food is great. I've had a variety of appetizers, sandwiches and entrees. Their chicken tenders are awesome. I am not a huge beer person but I love their peach ale. Very light for a perfect sunny afternoon.

The only downside is parking and it's always busy. There is parking in the back and on the street. The busy part is probably a good thing though because that means their food, drinks and service are always awesome so people come back for more."
0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"After writing my first review, the manager reached out to me and sent me a gift certificate for the poor quality burgers we received. He also asked when the food was purchased. This showed me the manager cares about the quality of their food and wants to ensure it doesn't happen again. I have been back several times since and the quality was spectacular, their usual norm.

Don't forget, you get a free meal on your birthday.

I love Joe's Farm Grill."
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"Let me start out by saying I am not a vegan or vegatarian. But seriously, this place is freaking amazing. I'll admit I was a little skeptical about the whole vegan thing but they proved me wrong.

I get the Thai spicy ""chicken"" salad. It is the perfect amount of spice for me, not too spicy but just enough to give it flavor. The ""chicken"" is so good and flavorful. If I didn't know it wasn't real chicken I would have been fooled. Their oatmeal cream pie just the right finish to the meal.

The way the restaurant is decorated is so different than most places around Tempe. All along the back wall they have old car doors lining the bottom half. On other walls, they have local astists display their artwork that you can buy. It's just a great atmosphere."
FkUcjHK7oQJIvZtUGjDxMQ,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,2,"The food is great but this location's customer service is poor. We had made reservations and specifically told the hostess and the server is was a birthday celebration.

We were introduced by one server but only saw her one time after she took our drink order. The rest of the service was done by three other people and they had no communication among each other. It took about 20 minutes to get our salads then our food was brought out not even two minutes later. In the process of trying to make room for more plates my drink was spilled. I assumed they would bring me a new one but it never came. So eventually I had to ask for another one and the server asked me if I was serious.

I have been to the carrabbas in chandler on ray and the 10. Everything there was FANTASTIC! I was completely thrown off by the gilbert location's poor service and how rushed they made us feel. They knew it was a birthday dinner but made the only memorable moment of the evening their poor service. I will never go back to this location again."
g13juipDPaqb170RDbIVJQ,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"I love this library so much. They have a great layout, a perfect location and friendly staff. Their website is extremely helpful. You can search for your books online, request a hold then pick them up in the reserved section under your name.

I liked the library so much, I begun volunteering a couple weeks ago. The staff is so nice to the volunteers. I feel very welcome here."
3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"I could not have asked for a better meal. I went there last night with my best friend. We got there about 7:30pm on a Saturday night and it was packed!!!! They handled the crowds amazingly and made it feel like we were the only people in there. I was so amazed how organized they are.

The food was delicious! I got the picnic salad and devoured the entire thing. I had a bite of my friend's sweet potato salad. SOOOO GOOD!!! I can't wait to go back and try something else!

Be sure to stop in the bathrooms. So original."
KFAJsmQ6GnHxyfmv16s9VA,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,3,"Growing up in Tempe, I've been to the Rooste a few times. Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about.

One of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.

My next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return.

If you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had. The view and atmosphere is what makes the restaurant."
Sb17eJkjHLjcPKSbpmRxWQ,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,1,"I visit the Gilbert and Warner location frequently. I've had fairly consistently good service and food at that location. This location is another story.

After taking our drink order (waters and soda) it took over 10 minutes for the server to actually bring it, blaming the bar for the delay even though she filled the cups at the soda station next to our table. After our food was ordered, half the food was brought to our table right away, leaving half our party without their meals for another 10 minutes. We had two orders of wings. One order was covered in sauce, the other had a dab on each piece. It was $.60 for an extra side of sauce. After clearing our food we waited 15 minutes for the server to bring our bill then another 10 for our server to actually run payment. Needless to say, she got a $2.00 tip on a $40.00 bill.

If you are in Gilbert, just go to the one on Gilbert and Warner. The service is better, the food is better; it was worth the drive."
J1qzIVBt3lGpiz-8UdjhXg,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,2,"This was probably one of the weirdest restaurant experiences I've ever had. We called ahead for a reservation but were told we could be put on a phone list that will speed up the wait for a table. We opted for that option since we were on our way. When we arrived we were told it'd just be a couple minutes then shortly after we were directed to the bar to find our own table.

Our server did his job of taking our order and delivering the food but there was something about him that was weird. On the menu it says every entree includes bread, salad and ice cream. We ordered the garlic cheese bread but didn't receive the other bread, which would be fine if that's standard or if they gave a price break on the cheese bread or something, but the table next to us with the same server received both items with their order. We got our food which ok... I had the veggie lasagna and my boyfriend had the chicken penne. My lasagna was decent but wasn't any better than a $2 lasagna lean cuisine. The chicken penne was crap. The sauce was like watered down paste. After dinner they server asked if we wanted dessert but we had to mention the ice cream that's included.

Now while all this was going on, on the patio there was a woman on the ground who was being attended to by other customers, not the staff. While the woman was laying on the ground, a server actually stepped over her. It was so weird. They brought out her food and just piled it on the table while she's laying on the ground.

All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant. I felt really weird the entire time I was there. If you are looking for Italian, just go to Oregano's. It is so so so much better!"
gNXfe1et9eZ7ytIsQCHXog,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"My mother and I went to this new location to celebrate her birthday. We frequently eat at the location on Mill and Baseline to celebrate various holidays with family. i.e. birthdays, graduation, easter, etc. The location off of Mill is quite small so we were excited to see how open and modern this new location was designed.

Upon arrival, we were greeted cheerfully and seated right away. Our server was very friendly and chatty, but in a good way. She took our drink orders right away and brought us back out beverages and pitchers to refill our drinks as we please. We ordered pumpkin waffles and the california benedict. The pumpkin waffle was heaven on earth! I recommend opting for whipped cream with no syrup. You won't be disappointed! And as usual, the california benedict was amazing. It's eggs benedict with bacon, avocado and tomato... so flipping good. At the end of the meal, the server even offered to-go cups for drinks. I always think this is a nice gesture.

I will certainly be coming back to this location and would recommend giving it a shot."
Noi53T0PWNEN9mQRS3-Ncg,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"I ate here for the first time the other day. I was a bit nervous that it'd be busy because it was a Sunday morning but there were still spots in their baby parking lot. Their drive thru is poorly placed for other drivers trying to park but their ordering system makes the line go pretty quickly. My friend and I ate on the patio. They was plenty of seating outside but little seating inside. The food and drinks were great! I had a breakfast croissant sandwich and an orange glorious smoothie.

All in all the restaurant is appropriately named. The food and drinks are indeed d'lish."
5nZVVPO_cYH9aQeClTP9zA,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"My best friend and I came here for dinner one night during the week. It was not too crowded. The cashier gave recommendations for pizzas and salads. They talked us into the combo for two which included a shared pizza and salad and two glasses of wine. It was the perfect portion and the pairing was perfect.

They could easily get away with higher prices because the quality of food is that amazing.

The location is perfect too because it is just outside the mall so you can  hit up the mall first then satisfy your hunger at Sauce afterward. I can't wait to go again."
AtSEe-B2mFmLFHBf4PLTrw,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"I have been here a million times over the years and have not met one person who doesn't love Wildflower. That includes my grandma who is a rather picky woman. Their service is great. The food is wonderful. And it connected to Changing Hands Book Store which is a fun little shop even if you're not looking for a book.

As for food, I recommend potato cream cheese soup bread bowl. It sounds weird but trust me, it's amazing. For salad, I'm hooked on their Thai chicken salad. I really like their iced tea too.

Wildflower is the kind of place you can just get a quick lunch or spend the afternoon reading, doing homework or chatting it up with friends."
q7zN2YFdNvi5mtg3uJ7tLg,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"I've been to Applebee's many times before and their food and service is always average. Nothing to write home about but not necessarily poor. This location was just that, average.

We were seated in the bar and we had a friendly server. The food was surprsingly good. We wouldn't have come here except for the fact that we had a gift card but I was pleasantly satisfied with the entire dining experience.

Keep in mind, they do half off drink and appetizers during happy."
yZAGhlsrmupLbrgdKm6reg,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"I went with my family to Don and Charlie's this week to celebrate my father's birthday and my parent's anniversary. It was a Thursday evening so it was not very busy but I happened to see everyone's favorite sheriff , Joe Arpaio, sharing a meal with some friends. To be safe, reservations are recommended.

The food was spectacular. They serve chopped liver with bread. The bread was delicious; the liver, eh, not my favorite. My dad though couldn't get enough of it. We ordered prime rib, BBQ chicken and ribs. Everyone was very much satisfied. For dessert, we shared creme brulee. Just loved the entire meal!

For the most part, the service was great. Even the bus boys were very polite and helpful throughout the meal. Our server ever offered us two free desserts because we were celebrating two occasions! My only complaint was when I ordered a cheese burger, our server told us burgers could only be ordered in the bar... but it was on the menu. Shortly after we got our food, the table next to us, had a burger delivered to their table!!! Then a burger was delivered to Sheriff Joe's table too! What the heck!?!? I was very satisfied with my order but they need to get that burger situation figured out because it looked damn good and next time I go, I want the damn burger! haha"
-Q8F0KbFIK3m3VeGXoCDEA,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"The food and service were spectacular!

Both my friend and I had Gyro salads and almond baklava. The salad had fresh veggies and an extremely flavorful greek dressing. They also did not skimp on the meat either. They was so much meat I couldn't finish it all! For dessert, the almond baklava was perfect. It was so rich and perfectly portioned.

When we walked in, we weren't sure if it was a sit down place with servered or if you went up to the counter. In fact, I am still not quite sure. Other than this confusion, the meal was perfect.

I will no doubt come here again and try something new. Also, if you check in while you're there, you receive 50% off your second item purchased!"
axi57Y3h5c8BxM1Xyj0KBw,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"I LOVE the pizza at Grimaldi's.

I would recommend giving this place a shot if you are a pizza fan. It's quite different from your usual pizza. The pizza has thin crust with light sauce and cheese. So far I've had pepperoni and sausage pizza as well as chicken and artichoke. They were both wonderful.

The service isn't spectacular. It isn't bad in the slightest but the servers aren't as friendly and open as I like.

Definitely give this place a try. I've heard both raving reviews and just OK reviews but I've never heard anyone regret going to Grimaldi's."
2lF1UsGcDpDpaI1lXgRX_g,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,4,"I went with my family to celebrate father's day.

I will start with the positives. delicious food, great decor, friendly servers, tasty drinks, quick service, yadda yadda yadda.

My only complaint would be the hostesses. They were both polite enough with the ""Welcome to abuelos"" ""thanks for coming"" but paired with the least enthusiastic manner. They lacked personality. The girls both looked like they were not thrilled to be there.

If the hostesses made me feel like they were glad to have me then I would've given the restaurant five stars! I would recommend eating here. Hostesses will not ruin your meal."
nbKSPpg3SONk_S_4ZR-t6w,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"A big group of us went to Monsterland last night. We had a great time. Our group consisted of kids (ranging in age 11-15) plus adults. A lot of the kids had never been to a haunted house before so they were a bit nervous. This is the perfect level of scary for those who are a little timid.

The guy running the door gave us a discount because we were such a large crew. It wasn't crowded so they allowed us to go in all together. The actors were very good and very creepy. From the outside I was thinking that the venue wasn't large but half way through you are lead into the basement. So that right there doubled the size of the place. The owners put a lot of time, thought and money into this place. I was very impressed!

I had a great time. For the price, it was worth it especially with the discount."
fBxDUu5ftmNHbbX5qD_FcA,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"My family and I have been coming here for years. It used to be named the culinary cafe. The eating area is small so I'd stick with groups of four or less. The recently renovated the place and the decor is much more modern. It looks great and inviting now!

The staff is always friendly. I love that you can here the chef singing in the kitchen. You can tell he loves what he does and it reflects in the quality of their food.

I always get their eggs benedict. They have several varieties that sound amazing but I always go for the regular version. I could not ask for a better eggs benedict. LOVE IT! My mother ordered the raspberry french toast this morning. I had a bite... SO GOOD! My dad ordered chicken fried steak. He ate the entire thing so he must have enjoyed it. The food comes out fairly quickly but not too quickly where you question how much of the meal was made prior to ordering.

I have only eaten breakfast here but from what I hear, everything they offer on the menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner is delicious. I recommend trying this place. Also, they do cooking classes here! I've always wanted to attend but haven't gotten the guts to try it. I would love to learn the chef's hollandaise sauce recipe..."
-01XupAWZEXbdNbxNg5mEg,fi4D4qlRmLgNkHr4GZusgw,5,"I spent the entire weekend at the rink for the turkey shoot tournament. This is our third year at the tournament and each year, 18 degrees proves to be such a great additive to the ice rink.

Throughout the weekend, we had our team pizza party, happy hour in the bar, the breakfast buffet and football on the couch.

All the service I experienced was amazing. The feel of the restaurant is warm and homey. Each booth has their own TV for whatever sport, or cartoon, you want. The quality of food is good. Nothing to write home about but amazing for an ice rink. The prices are affordable.

I recommend visiting 18 degrees if you have time to spare at the rink."
64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"Wow, I am amazed at how such an amazing, chic, cute, and inviting place like this can be in downtown Phoenix, no offense. The Phoenix area continues to surprise me with these little gems that are full of delicious food, yummy drinks, pretty people, chic decor, and for this one, an amazing pool and deck!

So, my co-organizer called in to make reservations for my East Coast Foodies group the day before for their Sunday happy hour. I walked in earlier than the rest of the group, the girl found our reservations and went to prepare our table. As she did that I walked outside to the amazing pool and people watched. As the rest of the party arrived, so did the waitress with our menus in hand waiting to direct us to our pretty table on the patio!

I am impressed! Everyone was professional, funny, prompt, and informative when it came to my questions about drinks and food! Their happy hour prices were very wallet/purse friendly.

The drinks were refreshing, cheap (during happy hour), and quite strong. I love love love love love this place and may make it my after church on Sunday event at least twice a month.

The tacos, grilled corn covered in delish Mexican topping, cilantro rice, etc. were all delectable.

I only thing that annoyed us were the flies that were trying to share our meals.

Go here, do a little dance, drink several drinks, and eat their citrus shredded pork, or shrimp tacos, and think of me!

E25-2ssHwsajyGtsllMXaA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"Okay, so I am rather new to town and have been to very famous and not so famous soul food restaurants around the world, and this one is to me, only decent.  I decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for Sunday service, that is right across the street.

As I walked over to the restaurant, I got giddy inside thinking that I would be welcomed by absolutely amazing down home soul food that I have experienced in Harlem, Houston, St. Louis, New Jersey, and even Philly, but I was not.  I knew that the ambiance was not going to be upscale, which is fine with me, but the food is not as exciting as the previous reviewers make it seem.  Maybe my taste buds are a little too snobby, but like I said I have had amazing soul food in other places, not just the South.

Moving on, I had the fried chicken, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, cabbage, and corn bread.  I must say that the black eyed peas and corn bread were pretty good, but the cabbage lacked lots of flavor, and so did the fried chicken.  Also the fried chicken was very salty, but lacked flavor, which to me is a little oxymoronic.

The waitress/waiter were very nice.  I will not go back because I do not feel like the meal was worth the $13.00 plus tax.

I will go over and try Lo-Los Chicken and Waffles soon and hopefully there, I will find delicious soul food that I left behind on the East Coast in New Jersey, NY, and Philly!"
35ACJdT8mJVtkJeFTbVsdQ,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,2,"I went yesterday to watch the Chicago and Houston football game with some friends.  I arrived after they have finished eating, but the food left on their plates did not appealing.  So, I ordered a Long Beach Tea, which is similar to the Long Island but instead they put a splash of cranberry on top.  I liked that drink, but the waitress did not come back with my change (after I gave her a $20.00).  When she finally arrived back to the table, I had to remind her that I gave her a $20.00 a needed my change, she apologized.  I must say, that that type of stuff does happen especially when a place is busy.

For food I went to enjoy slices at the two pizza restaurants just around the corner (see reviews)

At the end of the game they switched some of the tvs over to 80s videos, which is throughly enjoyed and started to do my signature Sexy Robot move to!

I do not think I will be back.  I will just check out El Hefe next time.

Cheers"

So, I finally arrived at Casey Moore's last night and was impressed.  This is an upgraded Irish pub/bar with a great beer selection, yummy yummy yummy crab cakes, and a cozy atmosphere.

It was Thursday night in which they have a special on Kiltlifter (sp?) and I was pretty excited.  The music was not that good.  I wish that they would have a DJ there on busy THursday nights.  That would really enhance the atmosphere and probably their people traffic as well.

I vote for a DJ on Thursday nights, heck, I have amazing music, I could just be the DJ.

I will be back very soon to try their oysters and some of the other seafood dishes and of course more beer on tap.

Seriously, you need a DJ on Thursday nights."
momjERcb6G6ienrfPuNArw,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"I am impressed with the food and service here.

I was initially looking to enjoy some delicious Korean food, but the place that I wanted to visit were closed on a Sunday.  I then opted for Vietnamese food.  I am rather new to Arizona, but have visited Saigan Pho in Tempe area twice thus far with my room mate, but wanted to try a different place.

I walked in and was seated right away.  I am not going to lie, when I first arrived the parking lot was almost fully empty, with just one SUV parked in front, which made me a little skeptical.  I walked in to find just one couple eating their food.  The aroma coming from the kitchen welcomed me and as soon as I opened the menu, I knew that they were serious about their Vietnamese food.

I ordered the fresh shrimp and chicken spring rolls, which come with a delicious peanut sauce.

My main order was of the seafood Pho which consisted of big delectable shrimp, squid, fried fish cakes, and crab meat (imitation, but still yummy) in a rich and flavorful pork broth.  I wanted to try something different, so I chose the yummy pork broth, as opposed to the normal beef broth.  I also had them combine two different types of noodles for me, ramen and clear ones.  The combination of the various flavors and noodles, really enhanced the meal.  I also enjoyed a cold Sapporo beer, which for happy hour was only $2.00.

I love their happy hour prices for appetizers and beers.  I will be back for more happy hour deliciousness at Pho Da Lat.

BTW, I went to wash my hands before I ate and the bathrooms were beautiful and clean and the waitress was very attentive and sweet.

I think I may have my next East Coast foodies event here.  THe prices are amazing, the food is delicious and plentiful, and the ambiance is welcoming."
vrpW_ZIjHvsAX3ByyeHjCA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"So,

I walked in for a last minute happy hour celebration and was impressed by the decor. As soon as I walked in I could smell the deliciousness of the food luring me closer to the kitchen. The bartender chats me up, hands me their happy hour menu and begins to make me one of the most delectable and strong Cosmos outside of NYC.

The meatballs and brushetta were out-of-this world.

I must go back!!"

Long story short I got the Duckling Sandwich which literally only had a small amount of duck, horseradish, slightly melted cheese, and came on an onion bun. It was supposed to be a hot sandwich which means piping hot meat and melted cheese in my mind. I ordered the mini and this sad Sandwich was $6.95. The meat was tasty but they do not provide a lot of protein. I should have biked straight home from bikram yoga where I would have saved a total of $9.13 and filled myself up with my yummy home cooking. Never again will I go to this overpriced and over hyped spot."

I cannot believe I found another gem in Phoenix where the food is overflowing, delicious, cheap in price, and just plain perfect. I never give 5 stars and this is my first 5 star review!

I went after church earlier because I was seeking something delicious, ethnic, and relatively cheap. I came across some of the reviews of this place as I sat in front of Squash Blossom debating on going in.  The reviews for Squash Blossom were horrid, so I sat put and then this restaurant came up as a place I might like to try as well.

I read the reviews and decided to take a walk on the wild side and head out to this pretty area in Phoenix.

I also got to practice my Spanish.

The Sopa De Pata- Beef Tripe Soul, Pupusa with beans/cheese, and the Pupusa with squash/cheese, a side of fresh Salvadorian style salsa and fresh shredded cabbage delighted my taste buds with every bite.

The waitress answered all of my questions that I had about the food, being that I have never has Salvadorian food before even though there are more restaurants like this back East where I am from; Shame on Me!!

I will be back here with my East Coast Foodies group and so should You!!

YWaiNzAOM7XePbUT0cdcaA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"So, after hearing about this place through one of my friends, my roomie and I decided to go and check it out on a Friday night.

I walked in and was impressed by how pretty and jazzy it looked inside and the musicians playing at the time were amazing and welcoming.

As everyone probably knows, during their happy hour it is 2-4-1.  So, we headed to the bar and were greeted by this rough and rather abrasive female bartender.  I felt as if I was in a ghetto hole in the wall at the bar, because her customer service skills were a negative 10.  Even at the hole in the walls on the East Coast where I am from, the bartenders were much nicer and attentive.  I may not be back just because of her.  Oh and they give you your two for one at the same time, instead of letting you sip on one and then come back for your other one later, like other bars, or restaurants do.  I do not like that system!!

Lastly, once again, the soul food out here is not very appealing and I think that I should just discontinue with trying to find it here in the Arizona area and just go back and visit friends in Los Angeles or family on the East Coast when I need an amazing soul food fix.

I had the cat fish nuggets, which were pretty tasty but nothing to write home about.
I also had the mac-n-cheese which seemed to lack cheese, warmth (it was luke warm when it came out), and flavor.  Even the color was rather pale and not filled with gooey clumps of various cheeses.

I am not sure I will go back, maybe on Thursday for Ladies' Night if that rude and rough bartender with the pony tail is not there!

Normally when I write reviews they are about the alcohol and food that I enjoy at the establishment. However, this time around I only enjoyed the delectable cans of beer here at Short Leash because we ate elsewhere before stumbling over to this place during First Friday.

I had the Coconut Porter in a can and it blew my hair back. I also tried a yummy Pilsner that they have in a can as well. Their beers on tap or not that adventurous or exciting to me so I opted for can and was very happy. I will return to eat the food there; it smelled and looked amazing as the servers walked the food to the tables behind me."
cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"Dear foodies,

I recently visited Windsor for the first time with a guy friend who is also a big foodie. He and I were really excited thinking that their happy hour would end at least by 6 pm like most places, but it ends Very early at 5 pm. That is something that does not make sense to me especially since most people's work days do not end until 5 pm.

Moving on...

We were seated on the patio, which at first was awesome and beautiful and comfortable since they had the misters on. Then as the sun started to disappear, the mosquitos started to appear. I was badly eaten up around my ankles and on the top of my feet by the mosquitos on the patio. My guy friend had to request that they bring over one of the citronella candles; that helped a little but it was already too late.

Now the food...

The beers that they have on tap were delicious and I truly enjoyed them. I had the Windsor Style Backyard burger without the bun, wrapped in lettuce. It was perfectly prepared and the toppings complimented the flavor of the burger. I had their Mac-Cheese as a side and was pleasantly surprised. When I think of Mac-n-Cheese, I think of only getting this dish as soul food restaurants normally when I am back East or down south, but they actually did a very good job with the flavors. :)

My friend ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, which on the other hand was not as culinary pleasing as my dish. The salad lacked flavor, dressing, and excitement. The Ahi tuna was prepared very well, but the salad portion lacked on various levels. He told one of the servers about his lack of culinary orgasms with the salad and the manager Lisa came out and talked to us and also removed it from our bill. We were not expecting that, but it was a pleasant surprise and I appreciate a customer service driven and involved establishment. Lisa was adorable, professional, and a great listener.

With that, I will be back. I am overall impressed with their establishment and the service.  Next time I will sit inside and arrive prior to 5 pm to enjoy their happy hour as well."
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"I am in love with this place. I finally visited on a lazy, hot, and beautiful Sunday. I enjoyed the misters and breezes as I sat at the outside bar. The bartender Silk was amazing, attentive, and can make a delicious drink. The coronado drink which is a combination of cherry bourbon, elder flower, agave, and one other ingredient that I forgot, rocked my world. This was during happy hour and this delectable drink was only $5.00.

I tried the goat cheese and bread, and fell in love with this dish after every bite.  Overall, this is a sexy, chic, and fun place to people watch, eat yummy food, and drink strong drinks!!!

GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"So, the other day my friend and I wanted to go and have Cantonese food down the street from this place, but they were closed for an ASU welcome back dinner; wack!! So, I scrammed to find a yummy place last minute on Yelp which was in the area, and Curry Corner popped up.

I am very happy that he and I went to this place after all. Since I am doing a physical and spiritual cleanse at this time and cannot eat meat, dairy, processed sugar, sweets, breads/white flour products, this place made me happy.

I had their veggie combination and was blown away by how well delectable they can make chic peas and spinach taste with their spices and techniques.

I am going back when I can eat meat and bread and will enjoy their fish/chicken dishes and supposedly amazing naan.

I am a fan!

Love,
The East Coast Foodie"
JEQaPs7jNT1M2os9lJDlUA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"Ok, so I finally got to enter the cute little home on N 7th Street where Coronado Cafe is housed for Saturday brunch.

I was impressed by how cute and cozy the restaurant is.  Our waiter was amazing, very knowledgeable about each plate, funny, and genuine.

My mimosa was rather yummy as well.

Now for the food: As my friend that ate brunch with me, ""This place did not blow my hair back."" The food was not that appealing.  I cook better brunch/breakfast meals that what I experienced there.  I had the : Arizona Omelet for $10
which comes with three eggs scrambled with caramelized onion, tomato and cilantro, green chili crème and avocado salsa, 9-grain bread, café potatoes & fresh fruit*

Ok, so you would think that my meal would have been overly, lip smacking, yummylicious delicious; it was not! The caramelized onions were overpowered by the tomato and cilantro, the green chili creme and avocado salsa were missing their sex appeal/flavor/spice.  The 9-grain bread was yummy, and the fruit was decent.  The potatoes were the best thing on my plate.

Also, my friend wanted to have their ""Best Crabcakes in Phoenix"" as a part of his meal, but they would not do it.  They only have the crab cakes as a sandwich and nothing else.  He really wanted to have a crab cake omelette, which sounded like a great idea, but in order to do so, they would have to ""add"" the crab cake to the bill, for an additional $9.00.  Give me a break!! Coming from the East Coast where I enjoyed many seafood delicacies at the NJ/NY/MD shores, I am sure that their crab cakes are not even worth an additional $9.00.

I digress!!

Overall, everything was pleasant.  I will more than likely not go back to eat, but I am happy that I got to visit and see what the hype is supposedly over!

Cheers"

RnR is one of my new favorite places that mirrors a trendy spot in the Village in NYC.  Upon turning the corner and seeing it's beauty, I was immediately in love.  Once on the other side of that by and beautiful wooden door, I was greeted by a lovely young lady with a pink bang and barely there outfit with great customer service skills.

We arrived too late to experience the $15.00 bottomless mimosa brunch but just in time for happy hour! Bingo!!!!!!

The menu had some unique choices and we opted for animal fries, which was about 1/2 pound of pulled pork over French and Sweet potato fries covered in herbs and aged cheddar cheese, and ahi tuna tacos which were good enough to order again.  As for drinks, the margaritas were banging!!!!!! My friend had a pineapple margarita and then a glass of the Alaskan Amber Ale on tap (good damn beer) and , I had a mango and a chipotle pineapple margarita.  They were amazing, each in their own ways and they were $4.00 each! The beer I think was $2.00.  I will definitely be back here as often as possible but next time with a Designated Driver and an IV filled with H20 so that I can simultaneously hydrate my poor body!

Oh, and the service was pretty good for them to be so busy taking care of drunk people who just want to have fun, me and my friend included!

The music was amazing as well, I almost created my own dance floor! Maybe next time I will!!"

It was such a beautiful day and I was in the area so I decided to head over for their happy hour.  Many of my friends have told me to visit Carly's since I moved here three months ago, but I have just not had the time until today.

I must first start off by saying, my ears were welcomed at the door by this great group of guys who were having their regular Sunday jazz jam session.  OMG, they were so talented.  I really enjoyed the various ranges that they conquered and the eclectic covers that they choose to take on, ranging from Amy Winehouse to Miles Davis.  There was a hint of funk, blues, and R & B present as well, with one of their singers and guitarist belting out two very soulful songs with smooth beats.

Moving to the bar, I was welcomed by this very cute and sweet bartender who was very observant and attentive.  Their happy hour is amazing with well drinks being $3.50 and 1/2 off of certain appetizers.  I had a well whiskey drink, which was made perfectly, strong enough and flavorful enough.  I also tried the Warm Brie, crustly bread, homemade apple relish, walnut, and dried cranberry appetizer, which created a culinary orgasm in my mouth (Yes, I am biting off of what Stuie on The Family Guy has said) lol.

Overall, my experience was amazing and I plan to go back again, maybe next Sunday for more cheap and delicious drinks, food, and jazz jam sessions!"
dIqMQYs6tmowQUygS8sQ6A,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"I finally visited here today after leaving church in route to FEZ for my East Coast Foodies Event.  I walked in and was pleasantly surprised by how cute and welcoming  the space is.  It is also covered in local art and there is a cool counter where one can sit and eat, read, drink, or chat with their friends or the employees.  I love the mom and pop homey feel of this place.

They had some yummy looking food and sweets, but they seemed to be a little pricey for what you were getting.  Their scones were a little more than Starbucks, which is a little odd in that it is a small family owned business.

I loved my cappuccino, she ran the sugar through my shots of espresso, which I had never experienced before.  I was impressed by the yummy flavor and the delectable foam that the barista created.

I will go back and try the crepes next time and another drink.

I never give 5 stars but this place deserves it. I went with one of my friend's foodies groups and it was an amazing experience.

The views are beautiful at every angle of the restaurant from the bar to the main dinning areas. The sunset was absolutely gorgeous while we ate our delectable meals. I did not drink any alcohol while there, but my foodie friends loved their glasses of fine wine. The french pressed coffee and their deserts looked and smelled amazing as well, although I did not partake because I was absolutely stuffed.

I had the Red Chile Beef Tips as my main entree with two sides: The Kale and  mushroom  and the asparagus.

I would love to go back and enjoy something different next time. Each person at the table ordered one of the appetizers and they were all delectable in their own ways.

I am a fan!!

The fried chicken here is moist, crunchy, flavorful, and all that real southern fried chicken is supposed to be. The Mac-n-cheese is a great pairing and the waffles here are delectable.

The owner has been there each time that I have been, and he has always asked how things were, taking orders, seating people, etc. I love a hands on family owned business that has really yummy food.

I have not been to the one in Scottsdale, because I am not a Scottsdale fan. I also have not had enough room in my stomach to try the red velvet cake. One day I will get to try the cake.

If you can avoid going here after church on Sunday than you may not wait in a very long line, like I always end up getting! But, nonetheless, I am impressed!"

So, we sat down in the bar area at one of the high top tables around 6:30 pm and there seemed to be only one guy working that whole area. He was not only serving but he was bartending as well.

I have been to great restaurants all over the world and could not understand why they had just one guy working a very busy area. There were people all around the bar ordering food and drinks and those of us who were at the high top tables as well. The other staff continued to walk by and head to their respective areas of service. We waited for a while for him to come back after giving us the drink menus. We did not eat until about 7:45 pm, which is unacceptable!!! I have a busy life and was not expecting to have to wait all night for a meal after a long day of work!!!!!

My guy friend that I was with who loves this place, reassured me that it is not always like this, but I am still annoyed.

Thank you for introducing me to bacon wrapped gnocchi with the most delectable cream sauce and very meaty and flavorful meatballs in an awesome and rich gravy.

Although my house bourbon beverages were not not prepared in a heavy handed manner like I normally like and too much cherry juice was placed into one of my two drinks, the amazing food made up for those issues. The next time that I visit you, I will explore your wines on Happy Hour and more of your culinary pleasing tapas.

BTW, the A.C. was blasting and the temperature outside was only in the mid-eighties, so maybe being a little more aware of the temperature outside is something to look into  and possibly expanding your beer on tap selection, because that is very limited.

The $3.00 martinis (cosmo, lime or blueberry) are the stiffest and tastiest drinks I have ever had, outside of me making them at home.  The blueberry martini is my favorite and it comes with delicious fresh blueberries floating in the bottom of the glass.

The food is delectable, which is why I decided to have my second event for my group: East Coast Foodies on the West: AZ Edition yesterday.

I loved the clams, which came out in a cast iron skillet smothered in a yummy garlic and herb base with tomatoes, corn, and other vegetables with a side of yummy warm crusty bread.

I am also a sucker for the moist grilled and marinated chicken breast that is only $3.95 for a nice helping and creamy sun dried tomato risotto croquettes!

The ambiance is sexy, chic, and trendy; it reminds me of a lot of bars/restaurants on the East coast where I am from.  I truly felt at home, relaxed, and full.

I will be back, soon!"
U6P56MjLrraN0JBNvOjxaA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"So, this was my first time visiting this spot after living in the neighborhood for 2.5 years. I was at a beer festival in downtown Phoenix and really wanted a hearty burger after all of that drinking and light railing it. Since, I run a huge Meetup group that prides itself on supporting local establishments throughout the Valley I decided to check out the Chuck Box to feed my beer filled, yet starving stomach.

I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with Swiss Cheese. I am used to Swiss cheese having the wholes in it, but this one did not. I was a little nervous to eat it, but I did, and I am still a live. I am a major foodie and know when things are of great quality, etc.

Moving on, the burger was damn tasty, in fact kind of hair blowing.  The condiment bar looked a little shady, but once again, I am alive and did not get food poison. The Bacon Cheeseburger came out to be a little over $6.00 just by itself, which to me is kind of pricey for what you get.

The ambiance is not appealing on the inside, but the outdoor seating looks to be a little nicer. I am happy to have visited this spot, but will not return.

The servers came around and offered their appetizers for all of us to sample and enjoy and I must say that food was amazing as well.

LjTK9yifZBHgj2HZn8Znww,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"Ok, I am all about customer service.  And, this place does not have very good customer service.  It is sad that such an attractive, and spacious restaurant/bar with such great happy hour specials would not train their bartenders to acknowledge everyone that takes a seat at the bar.

I walked in, and was greeted by two young men, whom I noticed later were servers.  That was really nice, and I told them that I was heading to the bar.

When I arrived at the bar, it was not very packed, but not slow either.  I sat down, checked my phone, responded to two text messages, and was greeted by two gentlemen to my right before the female bartender even looked my way.  It is as if she had tunnel vision and was oblivious to the new customers who had sat down, including myself.

I finally received a napkin in front of me after almost 8 minutes, while she chatted on her cell phone.  OMG, disturbing!

Moving on, she finally asked what I wanted to drink, ok about 11 minutes into the visit (Unacceptable)!!!!!!!!!

The guys next to me also commented on how long it took for her to serve me and, from what I found out, them too.

On a positive note, their beer selection is very nice, with pints at $2.79 during happy hour 3-7 I believe.  I tried the Orange Blossom beer on tap, and fell in love.  I then enjoyed one of my new favorites, Four Peaks Amber Ale on tap.  I did not try the food, because I was heading out later in Scottsdale for some food and drinks with friends, but it did look good.

After she finished her shift, several attentive male bartenders then took care of my new guy friends and I, and thus, my night ended on a positive note."

Ps4tmjscZNPHKF2rCS8tnA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,2,"Dear foodies,

As many of you may know, I do not normally give a restaurant or bar less than 3 stars. I must give this place 3 stars because their beer selection is very limited and boring.

The lemon drop martini that I ordered was prepared pretty well, but did not blow my hair back like at some other places.

Lastly, the food... Well, as a foodie that loves to cook and explore in the kitchen, I was underwhelmed by the tasteless dough that they use for their flatbread pizzas. I have made better pizza at home than this place. I have never had such lackluster pizza in my life; I ordered the vegetarian pizza, which they claim has garlic, spinach, onion, tomatoes, etc without the ""special topping."" I requested that the ""special topping"" be placed on the side. The pizza came out and I asked the bartender, where is the garlic, she said that the garlic is only found in the ""special topping."" The ""special topping"" consist of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. How tacky and unappealing. Where are the real pieces of garlic? Also the other veggies present were scarce and lacked in flavor as well.

I needed to wash down the nasty pizza and ordered a pumpkin pie vodka drink and that was yummy. But, no one could go wrong with this since it only consisted of pumpkin pie vodka, ice, and seltzer water.

The live jazz band made the experience tolerable but I will never good back. I was initially excited since I had never been here prior to that night.

Yikes!"

I was imrpressed  The flavors on my plate were amazing.  The cabbage, plantains, beans and rice, and jerk chicken were all worth the $9.50 plus tax.

I am thinking of having an East Coast foodies event there.  Good job with the spice this time A Taste of the Caribbean.

SdO1UHwE8Rjz3Pz2lBUa5w,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"Wow, I was in the VIP section of the BBQ and Beer festival that happened two weeks ago in Chandler and Rudy's was being served in that area. I had never experienced their BBQ before since they are very far from both downtown Tempe where I live and downtown Phoenix where I work. I am so glad that I was Blessed to experience their food finally. WOW, the tender and delectable beef brisket blew my hair back in a good way. The pulled pork was equally delectable and the potato side and coleslaw were out of this world. The staff that were working the event were awesome as well. I must say that the beans were disgusting, but everything else made my taste buds do a little dance!

Cheers"
QZJpXx1TbOXqzLx6u6xmaQ,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"Ok, so I have never been to Hawaii or had Korean food in Hawaii, so my experience is solely from enjoying the flavors and spices of the food.

However, living in Korea for almost two years has compelled my taste buds to know when Korean food is amazing, mediocre, and just plain bad.

The food here is actually rather tasty, and somewhat authentic.  It is not as yummy as Korean food that I have enjoyed in New York, California, and Korea but it calmed my craving for inexpensive Korean food.

I ordered the combination of the fried chicken patty and grilled spicy barbecue chicken.  My sides included kimchi (which was decent), seaweed salad (yummy), macaroni salad (a little too much mayo, but surprisingly tasty), and cabbage (which got lost in the sauce of the kimchi and spicy barbecue chicken).  The white rice was nice and sticky like I like it when eating Korean food.

The young lady at the cash register was nice enough.  She and I talked about Korea and how things had become expensive there since I last lived there almost 4 years ago.

Overall I received a lot of good food for less than $10.00.

I will be back and maybe have a beer next time with my meal."
apdb7MGnmnx6nGWBJ0ch_g,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"Wow, what can I say? I think I am in love with this place. The homemade-in-house Chai was yummy to my tummy and the big piece of moist and pretty chocolate cake actually made me scrape my plate! It is really cute and funky inside and they have a nice outdoor seating area.

Go here now!!"
MedWQ7ljpXnfyNnXPZaBmA,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,3,"Ok, so I know good pizza. I am from the East Coast and NJ/NY restaurants know how to make an awesome pizza. This pizza was edible. As some people have mentioned before me, the crust is not flavorful at all.

I was hoping to be have an awesome experience at this place due to the previous reviews, but I was disappointed. The only exciting thing about this place was the waitress, I cannot remember her name, but she was awesome and sweet and knew her stuff. Also, the Peroni beer on tap. Who has that beer on tap here in Arizona? Classic Italian does.

I do not think that I will be back!!"
5nWfU-qheLL-JzwYgHe_cQ,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,1,"What a horrible experience!!!!!

So I went to meet with a friend who was in town for her PHD program at Grand Canyon University.  She and several of her classmates decided to head to this hell hole for a friend's marriage proposal get together.  Since I worked all day, rushed home to wash up, and then headed straight there, I was hot and starving.

They are overly disorganized.  My friend and her classmates reserved a certain amount of tables, and yet they were not already prepared for us.  We had to wait for them to finish putting the tables together.  Strike 1

Happy Hour had just finished and I was not in the mood to pay full price for a drink from such an establishment, so I had one of the cheap Moose Beer cans for $3.00, it was rather tasty, surprisingly.

So, the service here is very very very very slow!!!!!! I ordered the barbeque-bacon turkey burger, and it literally took an hour to come out! It did not look appealing and so I spoke with the manager, who was not very customer service driven.  Strike 2

When we were served our food, the silverware did not come along with it as well.  Strike 3
Since, I have worked in the restaurant industry and I wrote food and wine reviews and blogs, I know what is supposed to happy when a client is not happy with the service, or the food.  Apparently the manager did not know, he then took the food away and said that he would take it off of the bill.  He was supposed to leave the food, let me finally eat it, and then still take it off of the bill.  My friend had to go and hunt him down with my food and so he brought it back out.  But, I was so annoyed that I left it sitting right there, to prove a point that I was not that hungry to eat their trash food after waiting an hour and then having it taken away!!!

The waitress was frazzled, the manager was incompetent, and the sound system was horrible for karaoke.  They need to close down, re-train everyone, and hire more staff!!"
N5B7OBTyNGgwU_Y2fwNcyw,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"I normally am in love with this spot. I have been here for many happy hours and food truck events. The drinks are always body-rubbable, i.e. delectable and boozy.  The food is also very yummy, although the portion sizes may seem a little small.  The sweet treats blow my hair back each time. Today, I got the fresh banana bread and almost scarfed down the whole piece while waiting for the light rail. I did not; I have to watch my girlish figure.

Since I am always here for alcoholic beverages and food, I did not know that they do not give cup discounts on their coffee like several other local and chain coffee shops do. I always have my Starbucks tin mug that normally gets me .50-80 cents off, which can add up to a nice savings over time.  Well, they do not do that here and, the coffee was disgusting. I am a former barista and have traveled around the world and Phoenix/Tempe sipping coffee with my pinky finger raised, and this cup of coffee did not blow my hair back.

Note to self: Never get a plain cup of coffee here, only delectable alcoholic beverages, food, and sweet treats."
Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"I really really like this spot, it reminds me of some hipster and cool spots throughout Brooklyn, NYC.  It is a cool live music venue meets Mexican restaurant.  The beers are tap are delicious and cheap in price.

I saw a very very good local band play during my first visit and the DJ in the front room always plays hot and upbeat music.

I love the crowd, the drinks, the music, and the vibe!!"

XHviODj3T9hesQPDGdPE1g,k3-rnDDoLuT_MCtA0n1SfA,4,"I am from the East Coast and am used to dive bars being a certain way, but this one is truly unique in that there are peanut shells littering the floors.  As I sat there, eating the roasted peanuts, and waiting for my food to arrive, I felt uneasy dumping my shells onto the floor.  I said to my friend, OMG, littering is okay here and I do not know how I feel about this.

So after my initial shock of dropped peanut shells and the first bite of my Sue-Ruben, and the country music performers on stage creating a nice atmosphere, I started to get into the groove of things.  Throwing your shells on the floor can actually be quite liberating! lol

I am a foodie and I must say that I was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben.  It was not as yummy as some of the places that make turkey rubens in NJ or NYC, but it truly did come in second for my taste buds.

My friends wings were a little bland and the hot sauce that he ordered on the side was not that appealing.  Maybe I need to try more of their wings another time, since everyone seems to love them; but I am a stickler at times.

The service was amazing and they had great drink specials, although I did not partake because I had been drinking earlier at RnR in Scottsdale and my stomach needed a rest.

Go here for: A great country-like setting, great sandwiches, good service, and nice drink specials.  I will be back."
7pGWy3mR7gjMSE6x2njqPA,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,3,"Came here on a groupon find. Coffee - good. Atmosphere - good. Service - good. Food - new American/gastropub fare that is ever present in Scottsdale. We had the chili cheddar burger and the veggie hash. Great presentation. Both of us remarked how they were kind of bland - not bad, but they just didn't have a lot of seasoning or flavor, maybe not enough spices, or maybe ingredients that weren't ripe? I pulled about half of the bread off the burger and added pepper and then I could taste some spice in the chili burger. To be fair, I asked them to hold the mayo so maybe that's where all the flavor was?  It sounds like the rest of the menu has some gems so will try a different item if I am over that way."
Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,5,"Fan. Tas. Tic. bbq.  The guy that runs this place is pretty well known on the national BBQ circuit, and is known as a great competitor and a great guy. The pulled pork, brisket, pastrami, and pork ribs are all fantastic. The hours are very limited though, it is open roughly 20 hours a week.
If I had one rub its that this place is still keeping lines deliberately very long when it doesn't have to be that way.  Good way to build anticipation and a name before anyone knows about you, but now Lil Miss has a following, they don't really need to do that."
iJi7yebXoPVXRyGqqL-v8g,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,3,"Decent brushetta, cheap wine, good happy hour.

Only problem is the live music on weekends.  This place has 2 rooms, the main room with the band and a back room. The bands here are WAY too loud, they are loud even if you are in the other room, and the only tables ever open are the ones near the band (hmm I wonder why). Came here as a couple with another couple to get wine and appetizers, all 4 in our group said, at the same time, ""mrmrhg rmrhr mrhghrh hgd"", but that was unintelligible because it was too loud so then we all shouted to each other, ""TOO LOUD LETS GO"".

This place is already OK, but it would be GREAT if it had dimmer mood lighting and a jazz CD.  Ditch the live bands."
tbmYBmGY9C_-A52rXyHloQ,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,3,"Not too bad, not amazing though. Tried brisket (good), garlic mash (ok), pulled chicken (ok), beans (great). The food felt a little pricey for the quantity, and no sides included with the sandwiches. The wrap was around the ""snack size"" wrap size from McDonalds, so don't go for that if you are hungry. No BBQ sauce sitting around (sacrilege for a BBQ joint) although you could buy BBQ sauce if you wanted BBQ on your BBQ. Staff was friendly.  There aren't many options in that immediate area, and there are quite a few businesses/offices around so maybe they have a captive audience? Or maybe I've just been spoiled by years indulging in the pleasures of southern BBQ spots."
ZQ0CBGI50UsOq2BZe1WIHQ,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,4,"Our table came here for the second time, for dinner on a Saturday night with a groupon. The waitress was pleasant and had lots of tips for us, the beer selection is varied and changes all the time, and the non-beer options are even really good.

The first time I came here I got the steak burger also, and since it was so good, I got it again. Ordered medium, it came out somewhere between medium and medium rare, very juicy and very flavorful. I'm not a fan of carbs so I did bunless, which they were able to successfully pull off.  The bacon jam is amazing, and really makes the burger.  We got a total of 3 steak burgers and 1 normal burger as well as salmon.  All options were really great.

Salad comes with an amazing basil dressing, I dumped it all on the salad and didn't regret a thing.  We also had some truffle fries, and they are pretty dang good too.  My mother didn't like them because she doesn't like flavors, but the rest of us thought the truffle and Parmesan were great touches.

If I had one complaint, $15 for a burger and fries is probably too spendy, even if it is good food. This place isn't going to shake the fact it is a brewpub.

They leave all the doors and windows and garage doors and whatever else open, so it's pretty freezing in there at night, bring a coat in the winter."
d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,1,"Not reviewing the food or atmosphere, just the management at CPH:

Went with a large group of 40 or so people - given the private room upstairs.  Due to what was apparently a miscommunication, CPH only wanted to allow our party to order from a set menu.  Many of us were not interested the set 4-course meal, and wanted food/drinks from the regular menu.  The management was not willing to allow this - since we didn't order from the fixed menu, they charged our group a $500 surcharge.

So, CPH got $500 from our group (instead of the much larger fare had they allowed us to order from the normal menu.

But that will be the LAST penny CPH will ever see from me.

Saddle House, on the other hand, took great care of our large group at a moments notice.  We ate and had drinks there all night, including some freebies thrown in because they appreciated our business."
UOtoOybZ5vAB4aXBLc57vA,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,3,"Came here on the Friday night before Super Bowl with my fiancé for some dinner, they are awesome because they are open late and still serve real food. Apparently a lot of old town restaurants don't get it, people that come to old town aren't going to bed at 9 PM.

Who shuts down their kitchen early when Super Bowl is in town? Brat haus does.

Anyhow rant over. This place was open and busy but not overcrowded which was great. The decor is modern and tasteful, warm and cozy.

I ordered the brisket and the cauliflower steak. The brisket was generously sized, came with extra barbecue sauce on the side because I asked for it, and the cauliflower steak was huge. Cauliflower was actually pretty decent, although I'm not a huge cauliflower fan, I wanted to order some vegetables. The brisket was very tender, to the point I would say it was overdone, almost like crockpot barbecue the night I was in there. I'm huge BBQ fan, so that cost them a star and a half. They do allow you to choose either fatty brisket or lean brisket. I'd be willing to give them another shot, maybe it was just the barbecue that night or the piece I got.

Service was great.

Drinks, I got the house moonshine and it was actually really good, maybe a little on the sweet side but overall memorable.

This place is worth checking out."
OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,2,"Came here to study - because of the music, this place was louder than Saturday night bar even though it was early afternoon on a weekday. It is also full of out-of-work hipsters. Headed for a more coffee-shop like coffee shop."
kUTusjnUPVZUgUJc2GuWuA,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,2,"Made a reservation a month in advance for 7, noting that it was an anniversary dinner (and hoping for one of the curtained off couples tables.) Called the night of and asked if we could change the reservation to 7:30 since we were running late.  We were informed that we could not and that we needed to make it within 15 min of our original reservation in order to be seated.  We rushed and made it right at the ""cutoff"" mark, and were seated at a huge table, I assumed because all the couples tables were full.  After getting settled in, we looked around only to find the restaurant dead empty.  We were one of maybe 5 parties there.  Why the rush?  Would have given only one star if not for the great food, and having plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  The server was quite attentive, so I think it's just the hostess desk that's not up to par.

Note; this will be a long meal so plan accordingly.  You can't do this place quick, its an experience."
AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,1,"Called ahead to let them know we were coming. When we showed up, they wouldn't honor our call ahead saying they had since ""gotten busy"". What is the point of a call ahead queue if they won't honor your spot?

There were tables available, they just wouldn't put them together to accommodate us. Even worse was their attitude about the whole thing. Went across the street to Hanny's, much better attitude and friendly service. If you are considering Piazza, check out Hannys which also serves pizza and is just across the street."
qOd7QUh-sIB7zN7RbP1-qw,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,4,"Grouponed here, great dessert and good service.

You will find the decor and seating a little basic, and the prices a little high.

However, they use high-quality ingredients, healthy stuff, and serve huge portions so it's not really that pricey from that perspective.  Check out their menu online first, since they have a lot of options."
k10rQp_ZRcXW63Fxxkojcw,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,3,"Wow. This place was a trip.

They are real slow here - if you're late for a flight, you may want to pick another spot.

Guy in front of me got frustrated that they couldn't follow his simple directions for what he wanted and left. Lady next to me asked if they could put hot BBQ on hers, they said they can't do that. Guy after me came up to complain that they had slathered his order in hot BBQ even though he asked for mild (I thought they can't put hot on anyone's? Apparently you can only get hot if you DONT want it). They put hot BBQ all over mine, even though I didn't ask for hot. Luckily i like spice! Another guy in line left because they were taking too long.
They were out of ribs and so they just made  me a plate without the ribs I ordered and tried to give it to me like that. Cashier had to send it back to get another type of meat in place of ribs.

After that comedy of errors I half expected to find a hoof in my meat, but actually overall the meat was excellent, though the workers are not on the ball at all. Very poorly run restaurant, but surprisingly good food.

UPDATE: Gave this place a second chance, same order again.  This time they had their act together, there was a guy behind the counter keeping everyone on-task. It was like going to a normal restaurant!  Much better.  Giving another star now."
DQXz0VTP6n14gKrop8xVvw,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,3,"Pretty good food. Great decor. Little pricey but you should know to expect that. Surprisingly un-busy on a Friday night during tourist season. Great open air dining.

Had the bleu bacon burger. It was very good, bacony and sweet and generous portion. Had the cheesecake, it was also pretty good, very creamy. The meatloaf got rave reviews from our table also.

We had excellent service from our waiter, he was really awesome."

I'm not sure it will stay that way when it gets too hot to eat on the patio, but the parking is easy (garage in the back), prices for lunch reasonable ($8-11 for salad and sandwich) and the food is awesome.  I had the maximus burger (burger stuffed with risotto) on the house bread with spinach salad.  Risotto inside the burger was a little out there, but I ordered because it was different.  Maybe one of the better burgers I've had.  Definitely coming back."
9Q9nXYkov-tCTOEhWJTgSg,SBSbNqZEIuwrTpYrasz2JQ,5,"Second large group experience here.

Out with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks.  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R, we walked to Saddle Ranch.  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10... but volunteered that since we had a wait, they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house. (!!!)

The wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes, but the bartender made great drinks, food and prices were good, and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots, again, on the house.

I was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here.  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyalty.


EDIT:
If you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink, the AMF is the house specialty.  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long island.

If you ride the bull as a guy, the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible.  For girls, however, they go pretty easy on you."

We called in a the next day to check over our bill and ask about a couple of inaccuracies.  The manager we spoke with and the GM went above and beyond to fix our issues and insure we had a good experience the next time we stopped in, which we definitely appreciated.

Buck & Rider has some of the best fresh seafood selection in the Valley, with a variety of raw oyster options, fantastic lobster and shrimp, and an interesting craft cocktail menu. The Buck and Rider and Your Money or Your Life (if you are a whiskey fan) are strong favorites. The fried chicken is also amazing, we ordered a second basket because we loved it so much.

We also are a fan because B&R has one of the better post-work happy hour deals going. Historically, Geisha has been a standard for our group of friends because their HH lasts until 7 for those of us that work longer days, and because they have both food AND drink specials in a fun and trendy environment.  Well, Buck & Rider can boast the same or better!  Will definitely be back."

No one goes here to dance, they come here for dinner.  We are a young couple and like music, but it was so loud we couldn't converse.  Totally inappropriate for the atmosphere. We told the waiter we were leaving.

Instead, he said he could get us a quiet table.  He found us a spot in the marketplace, which although it felt like a closet, it was at least a calm closet.  We had glasses of wine (reasonably priced), I had a kale salad which was amazing (first time ive liked kale to be honest), and my gf had some kind of fish dish.  Good food!  Like it.

Full of tons of hungry people with few food options. Chipotle has a line inside, and a mob of people standing outside. I go up to the door to pull it open --- Locked. Are you kidding me? You are sitting on the most desirable piece of real estate for a business in the whole US tonight, with literal mobs banging on the door to give you money, so you shut it down and go home?"

Very friendly greeting and equally friendly service (like, literally equal: it was the same girl), and the food .... my GOD the food. We got the catfish smothered in crawfish étouffé -- incredible -- and a monster combo platter of normal chicken strips and fried tilapia strips. Chicken strips don't NEED to be incredible, but these were. Hand-breaded there in the restaurant, and spicier than your average frozen ones. Really flavorful. The same can be said about the onion rings.

I'm not sure how, but I managed to reserve a corner of my stomach for some banana pudding.  I don't know when it was that I last had fresh, homemade banana pudding, but I'd forgotten how good it can be.

This place is the kind of authentic I look for in a restaurant. The owner grew up in southern New Orleans, and, according to our server, knows the difference between city Cajun and out-in-the-swamps Cajun. (Not that it matters, since I'd never know the difference.)

Next time I'm trying the alligator."

It's not spectacular, it's not innovative, but it's tasty, and ... good. The margaritas -- the one I had anyway -- were tasty and fresh.

But everything is badly, BADLY overpriced.

This isn't fine Mexican dining in Paradise Valley ... it's friggin' Chandler. If I'm paying $13 for a single margarita it better be prepared right there at my table, or served by a Mariachi band, or something. Like I said, it was good ... but not THAT good.

Same goes with the food. And order of shrimp enchiladas got me two normal-size enchiladas, rice (bleh) and tasty black beans .... and it was all good. But for $17 it should have been spectacular.

There's a lot of really great Mexican food to be found around Phoenix. This place just isn't worth it."

UPDATE!  Since I wrote this review I tried the food. Trust me on this: if you have an addictive personality, do not even TRY those cinnamon rolls. They are beyond delicious. The sandwiches are really good as well. I added the final star. Since I wrote the review I also moved out of Buckeye, and I'm still jonesing for one of those cinnamon rolls...."

The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!

Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.  Parking at the Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale locations is tight (as the Phoenix area tries to grow up and become a real city, this is inevitable, and will be more and more common), but it's better at the Mesa and Gilbert spots.  And since the food is fresh, you naturally have to wait longer for food that takes longer to prepare, such as the wings or the deep dish pizzas.

It was bland.  It was greasy.  The shrimp dish we ordered had no spice or flavor at all.  My chips were fresh, which judging by the rest of the reviews here was a lucky thing. A side of soft corn tortillas came pre-slathered in grease, for some ridiculous reason. And for what it was, it was terribly overpriced.  That's not to say it was expensive at all, but Filibertos is consistently better than this was.  Somehow the two green corn tamales I got to go were $10?  Give me a break.

Okay, you've been warned.  Believe me (and I'm one of Earth's least patient people), the wait will be worth it."
KYo0OqRr-q-TM2o66MBJYg,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"I've only been to Verde once (SO FAR!), so take this with a grain of salt.  But on that visit, Verde impressed me.  A lot.

Indoors is clean and decorated in a trendy, urban, utilitarian style. There was some audio equipment on shelves in a corner, and I wondered if they have a karaoke night or something.

Their menu isn't huge, but what they do, they seem to do well. The sauces were fresh and full of a ridiculous amount of flavor. I ordered the green chile, thinking it would be excellent, since the place is named after it.  So I shouldn't have been surprised that it was the best I've had in recent memory, but I was. Tender pork, fresh-tasting verde sauce with the right amount of spice.

But wait, there's more: even the rice and beans were fantastic. How many places put much thought or effort into a side of rice?

My friend had one of the taco dishes, and we noticed that the salsa that came with hers was completely different than the one that came with mine.  Both were fantastic.

If I have an experience on a future visit inferior to this one, I'll adjust my rating and edit my review ... but I don't see that happening. This is already one of my favorite downtown restaurants."
LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"I get a craving to come here about every other week.  Their food is consistently fantastic, even with their large, diverse menu.  The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!

Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.

CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"I have found my new favorite sushi spot.

I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.

You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi.

On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.

The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch.

Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.

Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi.

The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time."
JKsYM4eFoRtftDHbEf2j9g,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"This is not the kind of little café I'd expect to find on the west side. Their coffee is delicious (though I'm not a connoisseur by any means), and rather than make a half-assed stab at doing coffee shop-style pastries, they do crêpes. And do they ever do them well. Fresh and delicious.

Their menu expands by a couple items every month or so. They also have smoothies, but I can't vouch for them.

Typical warm, cozy café atmosphere, with plenty of IKEA couches and chairs to chill on."
S-Hksc_Hh_dMEbiTWDnblQ,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,5,"Inside the Bungalow really does things right.  The building itself is a large, old house, renovated with happy colors, artistic painting, and hardwood floors.  It's fun to explore the different rooms inside.  Outside, the patio is huge and beautifully landscaped.

The place has a very family-run feel to it (for good reason), and the food reflects that; eating there almost feels like you're having lunch at a friend's house. The menu mostly features sandwiches and breakfast items, and there are always tasty homemade pastries in their display case.  Many items are vegetarian.  Occasionally they offer chef's specials that don't appear on the menu, and are always fantastic.

But there's more to do than just eat, relax, and make use of their free wifi; behind the main building is a first-class yoga studio and massage facility.  And taking a yoga class entitles you to a free cup of tea!  Their selection is amazing, with loose-leaf and bagged varieties.

Their hours are a little strange, so check online before making plans to visit.  As they grow, no doubt they'll stay open longer."
8nP8ghEpT6WFcM6tfqAaGA,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,2,"Maybe it's a backlash to all the hype I've heard about this place, but I was seriously disappointed.

Yes, Sugar Bowl has old-fashioned charm. Yes, it has history. Yes, it has many Family Circus prints on its walls.

But the ice cream just isn't that good. It's not homemade; it's just Dryer's. When we went, we also got to try the caramel and the chocolate sauces.  They were almost the same thing: overwhelmingly sweet, but lacking in real flavor.

If you're in the mood for a nostalgic experience, Sugar Bowl might be for you. If you're looking for good ice cream ... keep looking."
j-SSlq3__BQr3H7lAyVvkw,7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw,2,"To be fair, I might owe Nello's another star, but it's only getting two because of the INTENSE disappointment I had when my wings arrived. I'd always heard that Nello's wings are the best ... turns out they're not.  They were soggy.  Really soggy. The sauce is about as flavorful as you can find anywhere.

The pizza, as I recall, was okay, but I honestly can't even remember what kind it was, so it obviously didn't make much of an impression on me. Nothing was actually wrong with the food, and nothing would keep me from going back again, but the blurb next to the 2-stars above says it all:  ""Meh.  I've experienced better."""
kO1-ZswCgQak2beKUMaYRw,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"This is the real deal.

In saying that, I cite other ""Japanese"" restaurants, whether some sort of fusion or what-have-you or not. This isn't any yuppie's vision of Japanese cuisine located in a cookie-cutter strip mall next to a Rubio's Fresh Mexican grill; this place was cut directly out of the landscape of Shinjuku-ku, circa 1985, and pasted in a rather unfortunate part of Mesa.

Some people might gripe or balk on the atmosphere, but I say it really adds to the experience. My server, I'm guessing the daughter of the owners, was very courteous and I found the inattention by the mother and father and the mother's talking on the phone to a relative in Japanese quaint.

SO YEAH, THE FOOD. It was great. I had an unagi (eel) roll with some kind of egg/chicken entree. Everything was tasty, and the fact the lights were off (presumably to save money) and everything around me was in Japanese made my white arse feel like Steven Seagal being a badass eating udon or whatever in silence in one of his 80s flicks.

Anyway, this isn't the place to go if you're looking for an upbeat atmosphere with tons of people and all that. I was the only customer, and there isn't a TV or anything. I guess I'd say bring reading material if you're eating alone.

The only con I have is that they don't serve alcohol. I'm not a fan of sake, but this place is perfect for it. I really wanted to have a Kirin in a ""real"" Japanese place, but oh well. They do serve authentic Japanese canned coffee drinks and things like that, though.

TOH ZAN ICHI BAN"
PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"I'd go for two stars since it says ""Meh. I've experienced better,"" but I suppose the staff here is more deserving than that.

Pros: Again, the staff. They're really outgoing and accommodating. Also, the interesting pizza choices and toppings are pretty nice. If you want to drink, they have beers and wine.

Cons: Gotta especially say ""eh"" to the pizza. The woman and I went in with a buy one get one coupon, and ended up paying about $10. The pie itself is probably around 8-10 inches, but it's one of those places that has the really thinnish crust and the toppings are kinda scant for that price. I get that they're new and maybe there's some overhead being in that place or something, but I dunno. Speaking of the place/atmosphere, it's not so bad; except it's pretty small and pretty much all the seating is directly in the afternoon sun, as the storefront is all glass and they have no blinds or anything.

Anyway, back on the pizza: It wasn't really that good. Somewhere inbetween a Kashi frozen pizza and maybe Brixx or something. Also not sure what's so innovative about their ""concept"" that the other reviewers are talking about; pretty sure you can get pizza made however you want at any other pizza place.


All-in-all, I'm probably not going back but I won't say it's a horrible place or anything."
frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"I'm not a fan of what's annoyingly referred to as ""Tex-Mex"" food, at all. It gives me the idea of pseudo-not-fast-food like Moe's, or lame cantinas, run by people whose ancestors probably couldn't pronounce ""cantina,"" that cater to the effete-minded ""Margaritaville"" crowd.

My wife, however, was attracted to the outside decor and lured in by the ""gourmet"" in the name.

Welp, folks, let me tell you: I'm really glad I went in this place. Their big advertisement is that they want to turn the tide of opinion on Mexican food/Tex Mex whatever from one of greasy, unhealthful junk to tasteful and thoughtfully-prepared fare- to the end of the latter, they did their due on me!

The woman and I had their take on quesadillas, which weren't the usual stupid flat flour tortilla cheese sandwiches with a pile o' salt and a not-pile of meat. In fact, these guys were made from homemade corn tortillas, deep fried (though not doused in grease) and filled well with your menu choice (In my case, al pastor; the wife got mahi-mahi). Folded over like a calzone and topped lightly with cojita sour cream, these guys are filled with flavor- flavor I've not experienced at any other Mexican joint in this city. The light crispiness of the tortilla really drives it home, and the quesadilla in all makes me think more of ""tamale grande"" than what you would classify as a quesadilla. (again, a boring flat cheese sandwich).

The price is kind of high; and while the portion is not *big* big as if you might get from a typical Mexican restaurant around here, let me tell you pals: It's well worth it.

Can't wait to try some new things here, sometime. In the meantime, go and try a quesadilla if you want to be flavor-blasted for the first time in Phoenix."
VsHhy9ixEze-AxNYt6UxLA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Disregard the ""get what you pay for ya'll"" guy on the $10 pizza; he doesn't even know where the apostrophe goes in ""y'all.""

The $10 pizza offered on Sundays is much better than any DiGiorno, the only problem with it is that it isn't actually 20 inches. I used to work at a place that had 20 inch pies and I remember having to fold the annoyingly big box. When I saw this box, I was skeptical of the size. When the wife and I got it home, we went anal and measured it. Sure enough, not 20"". It was like 16"" or 17""; that said, it's still a big pizza for $10- just not sure why they'd lie when you can measure the box and see it is 18"" or whatever.

Still, pizza was surprisingly tasty and plenty hot. Maybe try getting there to get your pizza on time, dude. Not sure why anyone would want a pie that's been sitting under a heat lamp, anyhow."
h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"This place is great.

Given the reviews, I was kind of leery; but a $5 ticket via Groupon to see a currently-out blockbuster (Skyfall, in this case) and I couldn't pass it up. Glad I didn't.

First off, I didn't see any problem with ""clearing time"" or whatever as other reviewers pointed out. We got into our movie at the right time with no delays. Second, I loved the seating; I was in a swivel office chair with the bar-like thing in front of me to lean on for added comfort. Most movie theater seats have me fidgeting, and this set-up kept me in comfort the whole showing.

Finally, with the Groupon $5 in non-stop swing, why *wouldn't* you go to this place? I get they're probably doing the Groupon thing perpetually to draw people in who want to buy the ridiculously-priced food and drinks ($12 for a crabcake appetizer), but if you're like me and just want to see a movie in a theater this is a no-brainer."
3_A59jPniLD5ViVuKMYpJw,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Typical ""upscalish morning café"" type place, with your expected menu of breakfast sandwiches and brunch fare.

The kickers are three: 1) Their bakery items rule school; even the doughnuts are great- you can tell they don't fry them in sickening soy oil like most places (owner said they do so in butter) and the chocolate frosting *gasp* tastes like and IS real chocolate!
2) This area, ""Arcadia,"" isn't much for such upscale places (besides maybe the organic eatery, Beckett's Table, next door) so it's kind of a diamond in the rough if you're in that dumb place.

3) The staff is bad-ass. I say that not in the way of positive thumbs up and smiles all-around, but in the way that they will show their irritation with you at the drop of a hat and respond rudely with no qualms, whatsoever. The owner guy looks pissed constantly, and seems the staff passes their bad treatment on to YOU. I have to hold back from laughing anytime I go in since they're so heavy with that stuff.

If you're in the area in the morn', hungry, and you don't want to die from food poisoning by eating BoSa doughnuts or the mexican ""food"" that's nearby (Cerritos, I believe), I'd say give Acacia a whirl. Just don't go in there if'n you're thin-skinned."
-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"Happened upon this place by accident, one day. The first time was good, I had the tasty Indian food staple of [chicken] tikka masala, and they spiced it to my taste. The server recommended that we try their daily buffet (11a-2:30pm) the next time we came, so about a month and a half later we did so. No disappointment, here! The buffet has a good mix of items to choose from, and the atmosphere is laid-back yet nice. I will agree with a previous reviewer that there could be some improvements to said atmosphere (mostly all the brown accents, yuck), but it isn't something that detracts from the overall experience.

The service here is top-notch. The waiter (seems like there's only the one guy, as we had him both times and it looks like he was servicing every table in the place both times) is exceedingly nice and always at-the-ready with a smile and something engaging to say.

Definitely give this place a try if you're driving down Broadway and looking for some eats."
e9UsRb-fmza5ukU8Ftduew,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Gotta knock a star off for the service I received, last night.

Our waitress was strangely rushing us along, even though we weren't meandering about any more than any other time we've gone here. It's nice to talk while we eat, and there were plenty of open tables so it isn't like we were holding up service for other potential patrons.

Anyway, we got club sodas and the waitress put them on the bill as regular drinks. Having been here a couple of times and getting club sodas for free (like water), I presented to her that I had asked the very first time I came and they said it was free and that every subsequent visit they've been free. She informed me of the exact opposite, saying they have always charged for it and pointed to the owner. I said ""All right, well let me talk to the owner.""

She went to the owner, came back and said ""She won't talk to you, but she says we have always charged for this since we have to pay for the club soda."" I dunno about that last part, seems fishy, but then she said ""You were just lucky the other times."" I joked ""Well, I guess my luck ran out!"" and she just gave me a rude stare; creepy, man.

Food was all right, as per usual, and I didn't even have to pay since my friend was treating my lady and me for our upcoming anniversary, but that kind of inconsistency and customer-blaming is bad service. I'm sure they don't care, as they get 20 bucks a head, but figured I'd mention it anyhow."
xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"So, in going to this place a couple'a more times I'm gonna have to knock it down some stars. HERE'S WHY:

My first visit looks to be the anomaly of all the visits, where the food and service were both great. All other times I've gone, the same thing has happened: The service has been piss-poor, with the person taking our order acting like ""meh."" Especially annoying is that they bring out our plates one-at-a-time, so that one person is almost done by the time the other gets food. I see other tables getting plates inbetween ours, so this just makes no sense; work on one order at a time, geez.

The food is also kind of hit-or-miss: sometimes you get a tasty treat and sometimes it's just a bunch of really overcooked or impossible-to-chew fatty meat atop rice. For the price, I'd like some consistency (with that ""consistency"" being the tasty treat).

Anyway, pretty disappointed."
v2p2jQ-FAse_FQI0LSh1pg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"So, it's a local business; that's cool.

I like finding out ""stories"" behind these one-off type places, so I asked the lady behind the counter to tell me about the ice cream. Apparently, it has a higher butterfat content than most ice creams and isn't made onsite, but by some folks in a nearby town or something. (Forgive the fuzzy memory, just wasn't too impressed with that).

Anyway, I got a chocolate shake and it was all right. Certainly not worth the 6.50 I paid for what looked like 12 oz. or so, but live and learn and say it was better than it was to save face!

The atmosphere is kinda hipstery, but it's nice. I may give it another try, but I'm not looking forward to it or anything."
VcGyezSNtkNBr2HidcaM1A,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"I always wanted to try this place, as I like sourdough and had rolled by a few times when I didn't have time to stop.

Anyway, it's not bad. The pizza itself was kind of disappointing as it didn't seem to have that hearty, ""slight mayonnaisey"" taste I attribute to sourdough, but it wasn't terrible or anything.

I really liked the atmosphere, here. My wife was less-than-enthused as it was kind of old in the interior, but it reminded me of places from my childhood (the 80s *cough*) and the people working inside were all very homey and welcoming. Definitely had a small business vibe where everyone knew each other and in fact many old customers came in and were greeted by staff with big ""How have you been?""s and hugs and stuff. Don't see a lot of that, especially being in the BIG CITY.

The only other thing I want to comment on is the wait time. It seemed pretty long for our pizza. When we got in, we were the only folks who didn't already have our food on the table. We ordered promptly, but it still took about 30 minutes to get the pizza. As it wasn't a super-thick crust pizza (though it was their thickest that we chose), it didn't really make sense...but oh well, nice place anyhow."
mYlNFkIiFY3SyDl-nPWR5g,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Pretty middle-of-the-road, food-wise. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you're looking for standard Italian fare, but it's the kind of stuff you can make yourself pretty easily at home.

We kinda pigged out here, as we bought the $20 for $40 Groupon; I got a calzone, the lady got a pizza, and we shared a plate of gnocchi. Again, it all was good but not spectacular or anything. As dumb as it sounds, I wish they had a Groupon option of $20 for $10 or something; if you're only eating for two, $40 of food is a lot of food here. If you don't have the Groupon, you're still paying about $20 for two entrees, so either it's pay that or gorge with the $40 Groupon- kinda lose-lose (but not really, because we're fat Americans).

Anyway, waiter was great and the atmosphere's all right- dark-lit Italian restaurant and all'a that. Everything seemed clean, et cetera."
TAoN9nsibXOxsOnnG7Kd_g,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Just moved to Tempe and wanted some gnocchi (my FAVE) and this seemed to be the only place nearby that serves it, though they call it ""cavatini"" and it's more like little snakes than potato dumplings. As usual for me, I replaced the normal marinara for alfredo; pretty much the most bland alfredo sauce I've ever tasted, but I guess they do advertise it as mild (though there doesn't seem to be any alternative alfredo sauce.) I just threw on salt and it was okay.

The atmosphere is nice; dark Italian restaurant and all that. It's nice enough that you can bring business guests but not too hoity-toity to just have a night out with pals.

I was impressed with the service, and our waitress in particular was very down-to-Earth.

Like other reviewers have said, the place is old but it didn't negatively affect my experience. I also agree with other reviewers that they should do outdoor dining; not only is it nice out there, but it could open up more tables so patrons wouldn't have to wait.

All-in-all good service and atmosphere, decent food."
VO-p1uczeMbzH8bEAv-RgA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,1,"I genuinely hate places like this; ""this"" being places that lull you in with some back story of the ""MUY AUTENTICO"" food/founder and their story of making wholesome food from old recipes, et cetera, and then you get your meal and realize either the founder was a liar or they just have been serving trash since she died.

I had a combo plate with a tamale, a tostada, and a taco. All tasted like they came straight from the microwave, and the standard beans-rice accompaniment was typical from a box/can in taste. (I got black beans, and they were served in a bowl. They were *just* like you would get from a can, and pretty sure they were floating in the can-water which most people discard).

I guess you can say one thing about this place: It's an equal-opportunity employer. However, that's not a good thing in this case: The college valley-girl type staffs the joint and very loudly gossips in front of customers- Like, welcome to Tempe! As if!

Can't believe they charge more than 3 bucks for a plate for this stuff in good conscience.

Leave it."
ioY-a1TntpsAGJAG5_1Zyw,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Welp, get ready to regret your choice a few hours later when you have a stomach ache.

This place is definitely in the category of ""fast food pizza."" Nothing more and anything less is probably literally inedible.

I used to work at a pizza joint that made pies that tasted exactly like these; thinking they're one of many who get their ingredients from a certain large distributor. That said, the cheese is tasteless (if you make the mistake of ordering here, take some off and taste it- definitely not worth the calorie investment!), the toppings are low quality (ground meat posing as gyro meat? Tiny specks of goat cheese passing as a fully-topped pizza?), and the pizza is greasy to boot.

I don't care if you're too poor to order elsewhere, go to the store and buy ingredients to make a pizza at home before going this route. Unless you're piss drunk or a masochist, you'll thank me.

At least the staff is nice, I guess."
jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,1,"Going to this place reminded me why I don't go to these places.

They should change the name of this place to Riff Raff n' Nausea; you get to be around all the rudest, most obnoxious people of S.

I'm pretty iron-stomached and rarely prone to sickness after eating subpar food, but this place had me breaking out the Pepto, PDQ.

Being from the south, I was surrounded by places that fried-up seafood, which is apparently what this place is all about. It has some more ""cajun"" style things than I'm used to, like fried frog legs, but still same concept: food put in a deep fat fryer. Yippee.

Being bored with such fried vittles, I opted for shrimp creole with andouille cheese grits. It was okay, but for the price ($22.50) it was a huge rip-off. I was with my company and thus wasn't paying, but I'd be mad if I had paid 23 bucks for a few shrimp in an average creole with an ice cream scoop full of grits.

I got their New York cheesecake, too, but it was typical restaurant (think Applebee's) quality, complete with food-colored cherry sauce.

The highlight of the place was the service, as our waitress and hostess were both very nice and attentive. The atmosphere is all right, too, but still pretty typical of a cookie-cutter franchise like Olive Garden.

I dunno, maybe I sound like a fuddy-duddy, but certainly not as exciting or ""authentic"" as other reviewers would have you believe."
ErHMVkPstNyefb3ZU_z1Cw,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"I'm all-in with any place that touts organic ingredients, so I wanted to give this place a whirl. After two visits, I'm just inclined to say ""It's all right, I guess.""

The pizza is more impressive than typical chain pizzas, of course, but both pizzas I tried (first being some Greek pizza and the second a masterpiece of my chosen ingredients) were pretty salty and greasy. I'm a fan of thicker-crust pizzas, Chicago-style and the like, so I wasn't super pleased with these more thin-skinned slices; but if you like that kinda thing..

Customer service here could also use work; it's not absolutely horrible, but both times I went the service lady (two different ones) gave the impression that I was holding her up or something. The second one, who I told we were going to be a second in deciding on our pizzas, said ""okay"" and stood and stared at us as we uncomfortably perused the menu. Better than disappearing, I guess, but still kind of jarring. The whole staff seems kind of ""irreverent hipstery,"" and I can't stress that vibe of ""We have something better to do"" more.

The ingredients seem pretty good, though, and there are plenty to choose from for you out there who enjoy a slew of exotic flavors on your pie. I'd recommend it over most pizza places, just say to order carry-out online so you don't have to deal much with customer service and to shy away from any oil-based sauce (pesto/olive oil whatever) so you won't have an oil rag for a slice of pizza."
cEfE7wuA68LBEH6581osNA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Pretty much agree with what Alan J. V said. It's a nice place, but so much of the food is bland.

We got a Groupon deal for the picnic platter thing that had 2 lbs of meat total, 3 sides, and even got free cobbler since it's free on Fridays...LOTS of food. We got pulled chicken, beef brisket, pork sausage for mains; beef brisket was good, had a nice smoky flavor. Chicken and pork sausage were okay, but really needed salt or something. The sides were lackluster (mashed potatoes, mac, and baked beans), but the beans were really super-bland. Toss some molasses in 'em, guys! We got corn bread that seemed like it was a ""third-party"" corn bread they had heated up. The barbecue sauce at their condiment station is not so good, either; came home and put Trader Joe's KC sauce on the leftovers, made it so much better. The cobbler was nice.

I was impressed with how nice and helpful all the staff was, especially the girl who did our order; I imagine she gets tired of going through how it works numerous times each day, but she was peppy and explained things like she was super-interested. The confusion is that they have ""premium meats"" that they upcharge $4 for, which is disappointing but I guess makes sense (The premium ones are bone-in stuff like ribs and tri-tips).

Atmosphere is nice, very homey."
RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Well, had to try this pizza since everyone on here and ON DA STREET has been raving about it. I gotta say, the pizza's not living up to the cred; oh, it's pretty good, but it's good in the way Pepsi is ""better"" than Coke i.e. it has more sugar.

Yeah, so they do they sweet sauce gimmick. While it makes your mouth want more, in my case my head was asking why I was eating a pizza doused in ketchup. Okay, so it wasn't that bad (in fact it was highly tasty), but y'know. I just wonder how it would've tasted with normal sauce.

Anyway, what I really want to comment on here is the customer service: I was impressed! I like when I go to a place and you can tell the people really give a damn about your experience and aren't flashing the fake ""Scottsdale"" smiles that have been rigorously trained into them by some customer service guru or whoever it is who thinks anybody likes that junk. The guys there were all about my needs, cool, and didn't try upselling me a bunch of junk. Just a breath of fresh air in this (and really any) city.

I'm a big Chicago pizza guy, so maybe I'll give them another chance; next time with what I call the ""real"" Chicago pizza experience. (Stuffed pie)

BYE"
dimv16yFu0JXR1n1SAqedQ,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Pretty good Mediterranean fare. I had beef shawarma atop hummus, and my tablemates all had other varieties of shawarma with the rice deal. It was fine, not too burnt like is often found at places that serve the stuff. The house-made pita was nice, and we had their take on samosas (beef filled mini-pies) which were called something else but same thing; pretty tasty.

The atmosphere was nice and fitting, given the theme. Middle Eastern-style music, upholstery, et cetera. The only off-putting things that stop me from giving this place 4 stars are 1) the bathroom, which was composed of all very-old elements (toilet, sink) and was pretty gross. It's an old building, I understand, but y'know. Other thing was we were seated at a table which was directly next to an exit door. Pretty sure that's a fire hazard. My final gripe for this otherwise-okay place: They brought out my food by itself and thus my tablemates had to wait. This should be a cardinal sin in restaurants; if you had seen any of my other reviews, you'd know how annoying I find it as it's pretty unnecessary. I'll save you the rant, but just say if you start a restaurant please refrain from allowing that mess.

Other than that, all was fine. I guess I wouldn't recommend going here if you want to avoid the Scottsdale (read: hoity toity) crowd, as they're all up in this place, but they were at least drowned out by the music."
Ln9fVEDjGdxmynkws2jICg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,1,"Used to love this place, but after the last few visits I'm finished going here. The big problem is the customer service: it's just gotten ridiculously bad, save for two employees (One younger waitress with glasses and a dude who looks like Clark Kent at the sushi bar). I'll take the teppanyaki guys off the hook, I guess, never did try that.

Anyway, all the sushi chefs minus the one I mentioned are either downright irascible or non-attentive. There's one Japanese or Korean guy with glasses who basically acts like you're not even there. We went during the Superbowl, and the place was dead...yet instead of making orders quickly, he joined other staff watching the Superbowl on a TV at the bar; ridiculous. Another visit we saw some guy I think the staff called ""Mr. Han."" He clearly was getting mad every time we ordered something and due to his poor English (not having a go, just saying) he couldn't understand what I was saying and didn't apologize or anything when he realized what I was asking was a reasonable request (I just asked for no avocado, and he was like ""IT DOES COME WITH AVOCADO!"" all angrily). Staff were clearly walking on egg shells talking to him; I remember that nice glasses waitress addressing him all super-respectfully, made me sad.

Anyway, this last time we went we were going for the 1/2 off sushi lunch. When our waitress, an older lady who I think may be the owner or something, caught wind of that she was all huffy and made sure we realized we had to get at least 5 rolls and that they had to be off a certain section of the menu. Fine. So, we ordered. I asked for no avocado and replace avocado with cream cheese. She informed me that to do so would be $1. In EVERY visit I had come and done this, no charge. Dunno if it's different just because of it being 1/2 off or whatever, but I think it had more to do with her prerogative. Anyway, I just said ""Okay, well just no avocado then."" Got the rolls, and you guessed it: All ones that had avocado on the menu still had it. I even got the receipt and she put no avocado (on the one, anyway), but it was still there. A meaningless gripe, I guess, but is this really that hard? Both wait staff -and- chefs screwing up (was the inattentive glasses guy, again)

Then, we got the bill. Whaddya know, they don't take off 50%! You can check against the white menu on the right someone posted vs. my receipt. Got two AZ rolls, normal price $8.95 charged- 10.96. 1 tuna roll, normal price $5.50, charged- $3.75 (Should be $2.25, since there's only one). 2 Shrimp Temp rolls, regular price $7.95, charged $9.96. You might say ""well that's each one with tax,"" but as you can see from my receipt they charge tax on the subtotal.

So, they lost at least two customers and I advise you to stay away. Shame, too, as the place has a nice atmosphere and decent food. Tsk tsk!"
mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"I'm not usually a fan of thin-as-paper style pizza, but this place's is pretty fantastic. Kind of a ""work of art"" like they try to push with Neapolitan pizza at ritzier places, but not quite at those places' price point. In fact, my pizza was free with the b-day coupon they gave me just for signing up for their e-mail fan club!

The atmosphere here is nice, too. Dimly lit like an Italian place should be, and replete with the whole red and white checkered table cloths that say ""pizza place,"" but they're cloth (not plastic or whatever) and nice.

All-in-all, pleasantly surprised for a free large pizza."

In terms of good pho in Chandler, I cannot complain much about this place. I always get a rare beef pho, and it's not bad.. The price is reasonable, service is prompt, and the soup is great. Location is good. Best after hangover. I will definitely be coming back."
sQV-yfhFjeRWnHw66n8qrQ,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,4,"The service was incredibly slow and it's for this that it lost a star. Eventually we got a wine list and then it took ages to order our wine and food. There was also a long gap between ordering and getting our food. The staff were very friendly and polite so I definitely wouldn't fault them on that, it was just very slow. The wine was very good. The steak was perfectly cooked for us (rare) and it was incredible. The best steak I've ever had. It was so succulent, tender and tasty. I love pepper sauce on steak but hardly had any on this as it seemed a shame to hide the taste of the actual steak.

This would have been 5 stars without a doubt if the service was quicker."
IUacTdoWEWEODMVFlUOOlw,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,5,"love the lil doggies! I think it's refreshing to have that instead of the usual Hot dogs. Also the toaster is so much better than having a bun for your burgers. Not to mention all of their beverage choices are awesome, the hardest part is choosing a flavor. Love the servers coming out on roller skates, very 1950's lol."
XJbTtaUgBCXZhhWt1_rYqA,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,4,"I'm not expecting quality food here. I mean they have to mass produce if it is 'all you can eat', right? That being said, this place is pretty decent for what it is.

The variety of foods was a pretty good mix of Japanese, Chinese, and American. I can see why people would take kids here that don't particularly have an affinity for Asian food: This place even has a decent selection of seafood.

Won't be a regular, but if I'm ever in the mood for a buffet. I might hit this up again."

I tried not to make a scene and told the waitress in the back. They were very apologetic and asked if I wanted take out, or another one, both of which I said no to. It's pretty disgusting knowing that hair has been simmering in my soup that whole meal.  They don't offer hot watered brown rice anymore. The banchans are same for last 5 years I've been here..  The waitresses were okay overall. I've been coming here for a Korean food, since there wasn't too much around the area.."

I thought the rib tips were on the dry side and generally not anywhere as good as what I've had."
nzV7HlERvD_v1DEfL_oiGQ,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,3,My experience at pita jungle was disappointing. I just went here to grab a quick lunch. The server seemed a bit rude and rushed. Price are decent for the portion. All in all just an okay meal with few disappointments. With so many other options on the street I probably won't be coming back..
UO_62NNq1pKY61teaoN2bQ,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,4,"This is a hidden gem in Arizona. Things are off to a great start when we tried out the ban chan. The HyeJang Soup and Bibim Nengmyun are my favorites.

The soup is a vibrant, spicy red -- thickened by the long-stewed and bits of meat that have fallen off the bone. The meat have generous portions of tender that just slide off. The spices are accentuated by just the right amount of fat from the meat."

Nothing on the menu looked fresh.  I ordered a lobster soup, and it was way too salty.  Yes, it tasted like frozen salt water seafood.

Not sure why people like this place, I can only assume because it is a seafood restaurant that caters to low class people who do not know the quality seafood..

Will not return again."
m1LOUjVzAAoCS61BTL5i5g,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,2,"The food is not even that good here, my favorite dish is galbi. For the same price, you can get way better food and service elsewhere.

ODQq6ba0rtpT2Iw0gY68Ug,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,3,The vibe and decor and so cool and quirky. The service was good.  I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was a big portion for the price.  I felt really good and healthy after eating it but taste was not that great.. So if you're just looking for a healthy meal this is the place to go!
EB0vzUuimM2nRXND5VJkIw,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,3,"So the food is solid, why the 3 stars you might ask. It's all in the service. Our server had a very negative attitude and rarely came back to check on us. my server took away my tofu bowl when I was still working on it. I'm not sure if I will get a better experience if I go back again, but I'm not sure I'd go back just because of the service and the feeling we were rushed. Overall service is 1-2 stars.

Bottom line is maybe it's just isolated experience but although my food was decent, the service really killed the night."
Clq09vq8uOjAbGY3BaQWDQ,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,2,"I've been here several times and tried different items per visit and none of them were tasty. Seems dirty and staffs here are so rude to customers.

It looked good when it came out.  When I took a few bites of the rib, something tasted not right.  The inside where the rib near the bone area was black.

That night I got so sick, couldn't go to work for 2 days.  Lesson learned:  Never eat something that is not a popular dish at a restaurant or better yet, try not to dine out because you never know what kind of food these people are serving."
83nnHcuC-PvkcUregRAr7Q,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,4,"Great place with great deals. I'v been coming here since it was opened couple years ago. You can find a nice range of stores, from coach, Neiman Marcus, Kate Spade, Tommy, and Polo and many many more. During the holidays you will find great deals.

The food courts are located in the far corner of the outlets, there aren't many. Food options are limited so don't expect too much.

The best time to come here are weekdays, it's difficult to find parking during the weekends. During the holidays it's pretty much busy at all times with a lot of tourists and locals trying to Christmas shop."

-sWz5r1dmPFXZP3f-EelLA,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,2,I'm not impressed. I came across this restaurant when looking for a restaurant close to my work. This place was not my type. The food was also not good. The only good part about the meal was the coffee. They give you a full pot. I wish we would have gone to the another restaurant. This was restaurant was a bad egg.

We called in our order for pickup, and were there ahead of its readiness...but it was still cold, as one other reviewer said.  Probably our lack of knowledge, but when we specifically ordered thin crust we thought that it would be at least somewhat crispy.  Instead, it was more what I would call a 'medium' crust and very soggy and doughy.  This was a Saturday noon, and they didn't seem over-busy, nor did they offer any apologies, so I assume it was 'as it is supposed to be'?  We ordered chicken/black olive/green pepper...and the quite scanty ingredients were sprinkled around the medium as if they had run out of everything as they were doing our pizza...also minimal cheese and sauce.  I know, only 17.95 for a medium, but I'd rather they charged a bit more and made it a 'meal'.  We were looking for a neighborhood regular pizza place, but now we will be looking on down the street."

Their 'greek salad' is to die for, and this makes my favorite meal when wanting to go to my  'happy place'!!   Self-order, delivered to table quickly and efficiently.

OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,2,"Scratch is still very new, so I'm looking forward to a lot of changes for the better.  They've got a great location, and the owner seems to have the enthusiasm for success.

Our first attempt at scratch was kind of a disaster.  We had quite a large group and were there within their first month open, so it was almost to be expected.  However we were assured they could handle our group so we gave it a shot.  The service was slow at best.  Our waitress didn't seem to know how to handle a large table and made it a point to tell us that many, many times.  She made us feel like a burden, but reminded us that she had 20 years experience (so I'm not sure what the problem was).  We were later visited by the owner, and I believe some friends who didn't even work there who he called in to help - bonus points.  Still, after being told we couldn't order anything beside basic drinks (because the bartender ""probably won't know how to make them), we waited forever for water, beer, and eventually food.  I can't vouch for anyone else because frankly I wasn't paying attention, but my veggie burger seemed like something from the Sysco truck.  Not impressed.

Try #2: Brunch.  Service was still slow and confused, but much better.  The Eggs Royale were commendable - their salmon has a uniquely mild and delicious flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  I was looking forward to trying one of their pastries, but was disappointed with the selection.  The pastry case looked bored.  With only about 3 different choices, the pastries looked good but unimpressive for bakery standards.  They had a selection of macaroons, which although likely fresh, seemed a bit pricey at $3.75 each.  I ended up skipping the pastries.

Lastly, and most notably, the place lacks personality.  There's something about the newly renovated complex Scratch lives in that makes it a fun place to go, but the atmosphere ends at the gate."
VrIskBdLuRxS0HsSimJOhA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,2,"It's like hooters, kind of.  Or at least I think that's what their going for.

Food - not bad
Drinks - standard bar
Atmosphere - ok for a sports bar downtown, lots of TVs
Service - yeah right.  You'll need to head to the bar at least once if you want to drink anything.

Would I go again?  Yeah, but only if I was meeting someone there and didn't have a chance to persuade them to go elsewhere.  And because it's close to the light rail."

MgHWbwuxxb_txhI3lK_bKg,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"TMI just earned its spot at the top of my go-to list in Phoenix.  I'm glad we made an impromptu stop for lunch here today.

The old, historic house offers a comfy, inviting spot to relax and enjoy an awesome meal.  Sara, our waitress, provided exceptional service, and the bonus was her knowledge of their beer menu.  They have about 10 beers on draft, mainly local, all delicious.  I believe their taps rotate, but if they have it don't skip out on the Sleep Dog Red Rover.  Delicious with lunch, and hard to beat at $2.50/pint before 6pm.

We started with their asparagus soup - amazing.  Next up sandwiches.  For me, the roast beef (hold the cheese) with their house-made mustard.  Main ingredient in the mustard?  Oak Creek Amber, also my favorite beer.  My friend grabbed the ""Cash Money,"" which we were uncertain about.  I can't imagine anything better - cashew butter (that I assume was home made), bananas, and a delicious cabernet-red pepper jelly, all served warm on toasted bread.  A-Mazing!

The patio was great for a nice Phoenix day, and the location can't be beat.  If you haven't been to TMI yet, hurry, you'll be sad you waited."
E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"I was going to give Maxim 4 stars, but I have a hard time holding out if I can't think of a good reason.  And in this case I just couldn't.

Don't hold the neighborhood against them... if you're from Phoenix, you know 19th and Osborn isn't the fanciest.  But then again, when was the last time you ate amazing Vietnamese food at the Biltmore?

An obvious choice is the Pho, and I have to admit I went safe with white meat chicken.  There was no skimping here... a huge to-go cup of broth, and an overflowing container of chicken, noodles, sprouts, veggies and herbs.  There's probably a method to eating it, but I just shoved it all in the cup and gorged.  And I couldn't be happier.

For some carbs and goodness I tacked on 2 egg rolls - a delicious mix of pork and shrimp.  They rank at the top of my best-egg-rolls-ever list.

I read a few things below about not-so-good service, and I'm having a hard time believing it was the same restaurant.  The lady who took my order was very receptive and made some great suggestions (including not being too exploratory with my food on my first visit).  Everyone in the place was smiling.

For a total of $8, I ended up with 2 full meals and a happy tummy.  And it doesn't hurt that I work right around the corner.  Glad I found this place!

Oh side note, I did find a Styrofoam cup in the parking lot that someone wrote ""Die Bitch"" on.  The neighborhood isn't great.  But the food's amazing, so get over it!"
Jj8ubiwwuCR-rrhrrjcryw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"Da Vang is 5-star food at traditional, 1-star prices.  I've never spent more than $10 here, and that usually includes at least one appetizer or dessert.

The service is the best I've had at a Vietnamese place.  Sure, there might be a pretty thick language barrier, but it's never gotten in the way of finding the perfect dish or having the order come out exactly as expected.

Of course I'd recommend getting some Pho (stick with chicken unless you're either very adventurous or completely sure what the other ingredients are).  You can also keep it simple and delicious by getting a BBQ pork sandwich, like I almost always do (and if you really want to be like me, make sure to tell them no mayo).

But seriously, if you take one thing away from this review - TRY DESSERT.  I'm not a fan of the spongy-green cakey things, but the deserts in the cooler are usually very good.  I'd recommend any of the coconut-milk-based concoctions in the plastic cups.  Ask for a cup of crushed ice, pour the dessert on top, and enjoy.  Don't be freaked out - there will likely be some sort of beans, maybe seaweed, who knows what - but it will be delicious.

Did I mention the people here are awesome?  Great food, great service, and your wallet won't be sore the next day (neither will your stomach)."
YaEPtPnEqh3WSsGq7cL44Q,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,1,"I'm not one to tear a place apart...  Sorry Wah Sun, you asked for it.

Normally, walking into a place that has all tables and no counters, no ""actual"" menus, only takes cash, and is run by an angry Chinese woman armed with an adding machine is a good sign -- seriously.  I'm all about no-frills authentic.  So I had high hopes, especially eating here on a recommendation.

Long story short, we kind of planned on getting stabbed by the worker for asking questions.  Don't ask what comes with anything, what kind of sauce, etc.  At Wah Sun, this should be common knowledge.

Anyway, the food took forever, and the place smelled like it was about to burn down, or had already partially burned down recently.  They don't take cards, no big deal.  We got screamed at a few times and ran away with our food, hoping for the best and receiving the worst.

All the food tasted like fish, and fish only.  Unfortunately none of us ordered fish.  Even the rice tasted like fish... not good sushi taste, but heated-up-in-the-sun fish juice from a dirty street fish taste.  Usually you can wash it down with an egg roll, but I think that's what they used to create that fire scene mentioned above.  It was like a black log.

Four of us got take out, four of us did NOT order fish, four of us wanted to vomit, four of us did, and four of us would have had to call in sick the next day if we hadn't been off.

Wah Sun?  Skip it."
ALn_0f-Usn3n0a9WBcjhhg,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"Hanny's is a pretty cool spot to grab a late-night snack and cocktail.  More of an intimate restaurant vibe than a drinking spot like I was originally expecting, but for a calm night it's a sure bet.  Definitely check out the elevator shaft you can stand in, as well as the bathrooms that kind of make you feel more like you're at a carnival than a classy establishment... but I mean that in a good way."
DW5TmdNGhepqrB0JGHnJ_A,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"Speaking as a non-vegan, non-vegetarian, non-gluten free, eat it if it tastes good type of diner, I can still say this is one of my favorite breakfast places.  The menu has a wide range of food with silly names (Koo-Koo Bananas Pancakes, Fruity Ol' Goat, and my current favorite, the Gluten Free Your Mind Waffle).  Each and every item comes from a carefully crafted recipe, and leaves behind any hint of healthy diet restrictions.  The pie, cookies, and even coffee and iced tea are all great.  The only reason a star is left off is that while friendly, the service is sometimes painfully slow.  We had to stop coming before work as it sometimes just took way too long.  Today it was far better, so this could be a staffing issue that's since been resolved.  Bottom line, everyone in Phoenix should check out Bragg's for breakfast.  If you've got visitors who are vegan, etc., this is definitely a place to bring them."
gHutuGMMMH-5Qv9DbemLFw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,2,"I'm surprised how well this deli is reviewed... I've given it about 5 chances now.  It always looks promising, and is right next door to the Jewish bakery which I love.  Unfortunately, I've been pretty let down each time I've tried to grab some good food from Scott's.

The service is terrible, at least for take-out.  They take their time and acknowledge you if they feel like it.  I don't know about dine-in service, but you can tell having a smile would get a waitress fired.

As for the food... potato knishs looked outstanding, tasted like something you could buy frozen.  Bagels were okay but I had the bar raised.  Scallion cream cheese left a lot to be desired, which is sad because I consider a good everything bagel with scallion cream cheese to be the ultimate new york breakfast treat (after a good egg sandwich, of course).  Damn, the egg sandwich was awful that one time... did they get their bacon from Wendy's?

Still looking for a good NY deli, so feel free to pass one on!  Wish it could have been Scott's."
47JJtwt6vhyYa5Z-mAFv7A,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,2,"I somehow only made it to Coronado Cafe once before they closed, and it was a great experience.  So I was naturally excited to see the transformation into Urban Vine.  Unfortunately, I wish it hadn't changed.  I see and admire what the place is going for, but it seems they've tried too hard.  Simple lunch foods were fancied up too much.  The burger was just okay, and the chicken sandwich didn't taste like any other chicken sandwich I've had before.  Boo.  Both came with chips that were so heavy on the salt and vinegar that we couldn't eat them.  A fresh selection of things to add to your water was fun.  Lastly, the table was as crowded as the menu, and simply wasn't comfortable.  Here's the thing - a simple old house with a simple old menu would have the chance to be very successful here.  If that happens, I'll be excited to return."
9AI96ikMEJv7e0WIfz0mjw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"The Phoenix Cheesesteak Co. adds a new flavor to the Coronado district, which along 7th St. is home to some of the best local restaurants.

I thoroughly enjoyed my ""Westside,"" a gigantic cheese steak made with portobello mushrooms, bell peppers, avocado, onions, provolone and chili mayo.  The bread was fantastic, as was nearly everything else.  I do agree that the ""chunks"" of steak might not be the best idea, as some of them are a little gristly (to the point of looking for pieces to avoid).  That didn't stop me from finishing the sandwich from end to end.  The chili may is delicious... and this is coming from someone whose biggest fear is mayonnaise.

On top of that, the place is shiny-clean, and the service is top-notch.  I'm convinced I was helped by the owner, and his motivation is clearly to provide the best possible customer service.  I could walk here from home, but it just feels so much better to drive after one of these belly busters."
6Z3lZEEIKv6opbyavmnGbA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,2,"Wow, Monkey Pants, you really let me down.  I've heard so many great things, from Yelp and from friends, and I couldn't wait to check this place out.  I finally did, and was honestly very surprised at how much I didn't like this place.

So the basics... you can usually get 2 out of 3 on service, price, and quality.  Well the service sucked.  The waitress was literally angry we were there.  The prices were ok.  Quality?  When your coke doesn't taste like coke (we're talking about soda here), the lemonade doesn't taste like lemonade, and the nachos seem like they've been prepared a few hours ago... not my place.

The decor confused me.  It seemed like they wanted to try for a sports restaurant, with a ton of TVs, but the TVs were fighting with the grandma's living room section.  I didn't feel the vibe, in fact I felt the desire to go home.

They have a free comedy show on Thursday nights as well.  The MC kept reminding us that you get what you pay for, but he must have been lying because they didn't pay me to sit through it.  Just about nothing offends me, but these ""comedians"" had offense on lock.  Jokes about rape and abortion, one after another, and nobody was laughing - time to give it up."
EV1jAj7NFNmNIqOnwZ4Acw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"Initial impression was that this place was awesome - a ton of tap bears, great music, a kind of stage behind the bar for the DJ, lots of people everywhere dancing and hanging out, and what looked like a pretty kick-ass outside bar.

Upon further review - this is just a haven for douche bags.  Andrea hit the nail on the head - totally Jersey Shore, although I think the people here were more Jersey Shore wannabes.

I'll go back again in case it was just a weird night.  Who am I fooling, they do have some great beers - I'll definitely be back."
vC23Fq8lMkNiZ4F8yh3ukQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"Hidden Gem.  And this gem shines bright (literally, it's got tons of fancy blue light oozing out through the doors and windows).

Good evening, Downtown Phoenix, it's past 10pm and there's still a place to go.  The reverse happy hour here (starts at 10:30pm Fridays, not sure about other nights) brings me back.  $7 sake bombs, where being loud and making a mess is never a problem.  Shannon (possibly the best waitress anywhere) will probably just come be a loud mess with you.

There's been a DJ in the kitchen every time I've been by, and the music is perfect for a Friday night transition between bars.

Oh yeah, the food's good too."
5oeiMlQFtJFZV6H8qatznw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"One of my top-5 restaurants in town!  I first tried El Salvadoreno because I had a Restaurant.com card I needed to use.  I felt like it was a pretty big risk, seeing as I've never had Pupusas before, and I didn't speak the same language as any of the workers.

Fortunately for us, the menu has English subtitles, and better yet - Pictures!  Let's cut to the chase... Pupusas are the specialty, and you'd be a fool if you didn't try one.  I'd go with pork, cheese, beans, but why not get 2 or 3 and try something adventurous?  Be careful, the food is filling and I can never finish my plate.

My favorite dish is the Arroz ala Vallencia, which is basically rice with chicken, shrimp, onions, peppers, etc.  It's served with their hot black bean mash type thing, 2 chips, and 2 home-made tortillas.  Their fresh, hot tortillas are the best, especially dipped in the beans.

And as with all my favorites, they serve Mexican Coke (the soda), as well as Jarritos and a few other bottles familiar to most Spanish-speakers.

Plan to spend a while here.  The service is great, but rushing is not part of the experience.  Relax.  Eat a pupusa (kind of like a stuffed, doughy tortilla pancake... with stuff inside it).

Delcious restaurant, authentic and very reasonably priced.  I first went to the Maryvale location, and they are both pretty much the same."
hNsRj2nXuALlJS4Op-8MmA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"The Garage is a great new place atop what is slowly becoming my favorite intersection.  The service is fantastic, they have a few good beers on tap, and the food looks to be promising.

They also have a decent happy hour, which as I remember has $1 off tap beer and some wine specials.  What they lack is any happy hour food prices, which would definitely bring me back here often.

We only had food once, which was a flatbread.  Pretty good although nothing to write home about.  Their menu looks promising but I would consider the food a tad too pricey.

The atmosphere is pretty good (with the exception of the lighting in the men's room, which can kill you if you're not careful).  I think its a great place to stop in for happy hour before heading over to the Swizzle Inn to get your drink on."

_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.

The good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.

I didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good."
jq9gzjKbVWgeMYzA0aFzxw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"Lola Coffee is definitely my favorite downtown coffee shop.  The service is always quick and friendly, and they always make my drink exactly how I like it without asking.  They just seem to do it right, each and every time.  There's always something delicious waiting for you in the baked good section, and if you're lucky enough to catch the cherry rice pudding, you're luckier than I've been in several months.  The coffee might just be the strongest in town (and it still tastes great) - I've always got the good-shakes for a while after I visit."
jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"This is another great place on what is becoming a great intersection for drinks - 16th St and Bethany Home.  I love it.

I've never been here for food, but I'm looking forward to it.  I like that you kind of eat and drink at the bar, and the bathroom is hidden somewhere in the kitchen.  And I also like that there isn't a sign outside and you just have to know where the place is.

Drinks are of good price considering the warm, upscale(ish) atmosphere of the place.  They also have a happy hour, during which you get a free snack-sized piece of food alongside your discounted drinks.  At last check they did a reverse happy hour also, which I'm a sucker for.

Why the minus-1 star?  I took a very large group of people on a bar crawl through my favorite intersection, and Dick's Hideaway was one of the stops.  We literally filled the place.  I accidentally broke a Stella glass (the true form of accident, not the drunk kind), and the bartender was pretty rude about it.  But that won't stop me from going back."

My big gripe was the fondue, which was just bleh.  And I'm not the only one who's felt that way.  Our last waitress said they hadn't had complaints about it ""lately,"" so they might have fixed it.

$5 for an awesome cocktail, glass of wine, or 2-pint-pitcher of a decent beer selection has me using Windsor as a starting point fairly often on the weekends."
WOz66UuVsfc2K9GxzfDnGg,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"Who am I fooling, I love this place.  7th Ave location is perfect for take-out on my dinner break at work, and the 7th St location is just right for walking to from my apartment.

When you go there, order:
-Chips and Salsa (spicy, or course) - delicious, and don't be shy about asking for some free refills
-Carne Asada Vampiro
-Pastor Vampiro

Nothing more, nothing less.   This is one of my absolute favorite meals in Phoenix any day of the week.  It also makes for a great hangover cure!

I have been disappointed by the size of the regular burritos, but the Vampiros really are over-the-top good."
xVtdfNY51JlTpXLGzQs5ag,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,5,"I have been here a couple of times for breakfast and the food and service have been very good. Their Benedict's are very good and just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. Coffee is delish and they put a carafe on the table so you can refill at will. My only complaint is the ranch potatoes...both times I've had them they were way over salted, almost like the potatoes were soaked in a brine. I have one request...make the jalapeno cake benedicts that you had as a special in August a regular menu item!"
FmraE2CWt65VRnEqCAqNEg,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,2,"The first time we went it was just for drinks and we didn't have any food. Went this past Saturday night as we were looking for somewhere new for food. Uh....not good. I had the Pinapple Pico Burger (priced at $12), I'm not really sure why they call it this, because I tasted none of the so called Pinapple Pico, as a matter of fact there was not much flavor at all! The meat was not seasoned at all and was very dry. I ordered the house homemade chips instead of fries and although they were okay, they also needed more seasoning and I got wayyyyy to many of them...covered half the plate! My husband had their wings and they looked really good and he liked them. For 5.99 you get 8 wings or 1 lb. My kids ordered off the childrens menue and each had a cheeseburger. It was the right size for kids, but a little skimpy on the fries. I was however disappointed with the price of the kids menu...$5 and the drink was NOT included...that was $2 more, so basically $7 for a slider and a few fries and drink. Our waitress was nice enough, although I have to say she was pretty unknowledgeable about the bar drinks, when asked what flavors of vodka they had she gave a blank stare...all she had to do was turn around as they were all right behind the bar. There was another couple with us and we all had the same burger...cooked differently and they gave me my friends burger and me his. Need to be more observant I guess. I don't think we will be returning for meals, expensive and just not worth it."

Good wine and beer list and dinner was very good. I had the creamy shrimp pasta and it was good, but for the price the portion should have been bigger. The hubby had the burger and it looked delish! He asked them to substitute jalapeños for the bourbon mushrooms and the were happy to accommodate. The salmon patties were very good and decent sized. We also ordered a meat and cheese board for am appetizer. We had the prosciutto and the lamb jerky and both were excellent, but again the portion sizes could be bigger. They had a live jazz band playing (it was saturday night) and it was nice, not to loud. We were there on a very rainy night and even still the place was busy.

The 1st time was last Jan for my husbands birthday, we had a large party and our waiter (sorry, can't remember his name) was great. Large parties can be a pain, but we never had to wait to be asked if we wanted another drink, etc. My husband and I went back about 3 months later, had the same waiter and he remembered us...including my husbands name! Pizza is very good (it's very thin crust which I like) and I always ask them to leave it in a couple minutes longer than normal because I like the crust a little crispier. Always comes out right. The Capo is probably my favorite, but the Aloha, Meditteranian, Buffalo Chicken and Marg pizza are all good as well. Last time I was there we had to wait for a table and we ordered a drink at the bar...I ordered a Manhattan and the bartender was quite thrilled to ""finally make a real cocktail"" Funny!

We had salad, penne pasta with tomato sauce. some linguine dish and lightly breaded chicken breasts as our buffet meal. The salad was ok....hard to mess that up. The penne with tomato sauce was just that..penne pasta with what looked and tasted like canned crushed tomatoes. No seasoning what so ever and I ended up adding salt (I never salt my food), very bland. The linguine dish was noodles in an oily broth like sauce that had random mozzarella cheese melted on top and canned looking plain diced tomatoes...again no seasoning or flavor. My mom said she had a garlic clove in her serving...I tasted no garlic or any other flavor for that matter. The chicken was plain lightly breaded breast that was...if you can believe it, so salty it was nearly inedible. I ate the chicken with the linguine just to give the linguine flavor. This place was packed and for the life of me I don't know why. If all the food is as tasteless as ours was, I don't know why anyone would spend their money here. I was looking forward to trying this place because I love Italian food, but I am glad this was on someone else's dime because I would have sent my meal back if I was the one paying for it. Would not recommend this one..."
-CfFjcCcGGDM9MVH_d42RQ,dldj15ncHvA7xMfXUjKdDQ,4,"Food was good, although $22 for flank steak is a little much, it had good flavor, but I ordered medium rare and got well done. The club sandwich was really good and more reasonably priced. Our waitress was friendly, but did not have much knowledge of the menu. She had never tasted any of the items we asked about, stating ""that's to expensive for me to taste"" which I guess means she has to pay for her own dinners.

Owners: I don't blame the waitress for her lack of menu knowledge...I blame you. Your staff should try every menu item in training so they can sell it.

I would go back again. The lunch menu is available for dinner too if your not looking to spend $15+ per person on dinner."

Ordered a shrimp and a fish taco and they were very good, fresh ingredients and they were just the right size. Salsa is very good, but if you want more spice ask for the habanero version. My only complaint is that they don't have full sized pitchers of beer...small ones at about 2.5 pints each. However, that being said it was happy hour (we were there about 1pm) and they were only $5 so all is forgiven. I like that you can sit outside and the back outside patio has a large grass area so if you bring your kids they can lounge around and not bother anyone as it is not right next to any tables.

Wednesday night trivia is fun, but don't go here if you expect stellar food. I can't for the life of me understand why people say the food is ""stellar"" here. Last night a group of us went in after a long day at work and I ordered the ""Port Wine Burger"". The waitress said ""it's really melty""...sounded good and I was starving. The ""port wine cheese"" that I made the mistake of thinking would be actual cheese was in fact port wine cheese SPREAD akin to the cracker spread in the tub. SERIOUSLY?? The burger itself was cooked fine and was seasoned. I ordered sweet potato fries as a side and they were not only way overcooked (or had been sitting over a fryer for to long) and cold. My friend also ordered the sweet potato fries and hers were the same. We asked for a new batch and the ones that came out were obviously fresh made and you could see the difference...wish now that I would have taken a pic to share to compare the difference! Why on earth would you serve the old ones?? So far the only things I have actually like there food wise is the Southwest Cobb and the fried zucchini....not much else. They have plenty of draft beers to choose from including some craft beers, so go for the beer, but save your money for food elsewhere."

The grilled tomatoes really make the sandwich! For breakfast there are several sandwich and oatmeal (steel cut) options and if you really want a treat get a fresh made bun or cinnamon roll. I have had both the sweet and savory buns and both are fantastic. The sides are the usual chips and sides salads with one exception...THE KALE SLAW! It is the best! If you don't think you are a ""kale person"" this is your step to liking it. Not your typical slaw...no mayo but instead a sweet honey vinegarette so you can eat the whole thing without the guilt!

I got the chili verde benny and it was delish!! The hashbrowns were ok, but for me combined with the benny a little much. I learned I could get fruit if I wanted...next time!

It's been a while since we have eaten there (not since it was Irish Republic), but the food was good. They have a large beer selection and I've tried several of the ""blended beers"" from the menu, my favorite being the white chocolate (mix of vanilla porter and chocolate beer..sounds strange, but it is delish!) They also carry my favorite blueberry beer (Big Blue Van). They make a great Moscow Mule, but beware...they take your drivers license so you won't steal the copper cup. This is a huge put off for me as I feel they are accusing their customers of stealing. I'm sure this has happened in the past, but come on...FYI Bourbon Jack's does not do this.

One improvement I have noticed since becoming Murphy's Law again is that the place no longer smells like urine. I had posted a review back when it was the Irish Republic House about the overwhelming urine smell (it was ok in the front, but the closer you would get to the bathrooms the smell became unbearable and you could not sit back there.) Something obviously got fixed and I don't think scented candles (I saw another review about to many scented candles) could have masked that retched smell.

Live music on the weekends, but we always leave before that...don't like to sit and yell my conversation, but I'm sure the bands are good!"

H1Mp8I2YuyBe8lFHnRk3iA,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,5,"OK, first $32.99 for Dinner...at first I thought it was a lot, but quickly tasted everything they dish out, and let me tell you...This place is a great place. Better come hungry so you can try everything.  So basically starve yourselves...

5 stars all the way"

Wings
really, this place rocks"
wSpUTl9Bho2WRo9C5p_-Pg,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,4,"Can't really say anything bad about this place, but it did not knock me off my feet. I went to use a Veebow discount at a restaurant next door, but saw that this was a lil more kid friendly so we stopped in.
Pros: Pizza was really good, not great, but really good. Salads was good as well, the food was not bad at all. They had a mac and chees for my son which I caught my wife enjoying as well.
All in all, we are going to help promote this business, because of friendly mgr and staff. They will keep seeing us there over and over.

This place is Good."
sQV-yfhFjeRWnHw66n8qrQ,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,5,"I have been here about 5 times. Every time I go, they do a great service. The staff is always helpful and create a great atmosphere. Defiantly worth the $$$$."
go7g1fwoeg4a8JATkGzW0w,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,5,"This place is horrible...I just love their Nachos & Big A$$ wings. This is a must go, at least once to see how good it is. I said it was horrible earlier because it can't be good on the diet...oh well, everyone gets a cheat day."

A lil $$, but really a cool place to bring out of towners...."

Thank you for finally opening one close by me...."

I was so shocked how I have never heard of them before.
Can't wait to go back. This is a different  type of pizza place.
I am a fan"

OK'

It's a hole in the wall. It did stink in there, so I wonder if I came in on a bad day.
Food was OK, Once is enough for me.

Not Bad, just not good enough to go back. It didn't wow me."
O_J5e6aoskxhGx8meOm1Og,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,2,"Went in n a Valpak coupon. Had dinner there. It was super slow, but thought maybe because nothing else is open around them.The Super market was closed down. The service was friendly, that's a Pro. the Cons, where do I start. Food was hot on one side, colder on the other or in the core of the meat. Wierd.
Food took a lil longer, but that was ok, if it was busy.
It was a lil $$$ for the quality of the food. I will not leave Pei Wei again, I swear.
My last thought, we should of ate next door at Los Fav taco shop."
QbtJvTQfTFbPqBhjkI59BA,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,4,"Wings are great.
Awesome place to go and catch up with friends."

Great service.
Food is really good, had a flat bread BBQ pizza, wow.
I will be back"

Teriyaki Chicken with Spicy sauce, oh yea.
A lil $$, but everything is going up now-a-days except my paycheck..."

The BBQ Chicken Pizza is the bomb.

Gina and Bruce, you need to get on Veebow. That's Valarie Bertinelli's company."
_R2r4SlngDt9X2K1UZyWXw,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,5,"Super nice staff.
I love the Thai Chicken Salad, and Tomato Soup.
I go there 3 times a week mainly because the food never disapoints."
CFyPbqZaxoBTjOmVjSn_8Q,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,5,"Best street tacos in the state and sooo close to the Suns and Dbax game. a must pre game dinner. much less than anything at the stadium and so much more flavor.

A must...."

Great patio and the Happy Hour is unreal.

Buffalo Chicken sub, awesome."

Protein style or not, these burgers kick tail."
hDDh3dtuFZyty5KOUN0JmA,m-OpLxewxny8FIQZjUoNOA,3,"I was told this was a great place so I wanted to try it out.
Went there for lunch, sat at the bar tables.
Pros: TV's, Food, Helpful & friendly staff.
Cons: place was a lil $$, Garlic Fries were not at all how I have had them at other locations, small portion, and just a lil Garlic... Hello Garlic Fries.
This is still a very nice place, I could as easily give it 4 Stars, but I went for Garlic Fries and was heavily disapointed, I will be back."

Love The Thai Chicken Salad & Tomato soup, That's my go to meal.
If you love the Club Sandwich, just have them add cranberry, you'll love me later.

This place is awesome."

Only strike, and it's not enuff to take a star off.....too much butter  on cheese crisp and greasy tacos....

But this place is legit."
Xv4PTiQ_scrhC4oc5kf6aA,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Excellent food, unique in the best way possible. Try the specials, they rock. This place has a great atmosphere and scratch made food. This is what your Grandma would make if she was Polish and had the chops of a Michelin chef. You will be surprised and will come back. Oh and the soups are exactly what any good polish place would have."
3RHgRaCRPuLdJ6PLZL6MGA,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Updated Review - Still going strong, now with house made pita!!! The falafel (house made and fried to order) is superb; excellently spiced with a crunchy exterior and moist center. You will want to order extra pita, grab a bag of six to elevate your same old lunch 'wrap'. Worth the carbs!!!Great service with a smile. Ask if you do not know what something is and be a little adventurous."
C3gKBIsZKR3bp43BbOu8qA,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,5,"Everything we get here is fresh and tasty. Unique Thai in the best way possible. Paht Thai is great, get it spicy. Tempura green beans with a surprise of cilantro that delivers a good spin. The best silver noodles we have had; add a little broccoli for nice crunchiness. Get a Thai iced tea; you'll love it. Great, friendly staff who remembers us easily, and knows what we want or what to recommend. Drop by anytime and you will be glad you did."
LtNgP4FqXp5nMFOHErK8cw,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Great sushi, very innovative with use of ingredients. Tomato, jalapeño, etc. May not be traditional, however well executed. The Ono Sashimi shows great respect for fish, just garlicky soy sauce, radish. Quite good. Service is good, Paul is a great chef. Sit at counter, enjoy the show."
ROuiI7sWhEMLodSylU2Qpg,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,3,"Not really fast, not fine dinning either. Casual place to get tacos with handmade tortillas (corn and flour). Mexican sodas, beer, Jamaica, and Horchata. Good food, at fair prices. The salsa bar is a plus."
jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,5,"This is what Phoenix should be known for.  Come in, and find a cool, dark comfy spot (the best show is at the bar, where you will watch the master chef assemble your feast) with some of the best New Mexican cuisine you have even heard of. Get the Richardson's combo of Jalapeño Benedict and Enchiladas, or better yet, the best non-mom Meatloaf a la Vic. You WILL be back, so do not worry that everything looks delicious; order the first thing that catches your fancy (adovada if you cannot decide), then get the next thing tomorrow, and the next thing the day after that... Get a drink, sit back, and await the love your tastebuds will receive."
9Cq_NVvWZOEAzmE7tqJgmg,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,5,"Have followed these guys from when Sit-Stay was the weekend parking spot at Camelback and Central. They rocked then and have only gotten better! The fried green tomatoes stack will change your life. This is not your Dad's dog joint. Think haute cuisine in a Naan wrapper. The Bear is what you try first. I mean it, the peanut butter, bbq sauce, and cracker jacks totally meld into heaven in your mouth. They have beer floats also, I know, BEER floats. And now with Rollover Donuts; I should live here! These folks are so cool also. This is what Phoenix is supposed to taste like. Great local food, without the pretentious attitude. Go now, get up! Your palate will tongue kiss you for it."
szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Dim sum - Excellent choice, fresh ingredients. Be adventurous, try the rice noodle - beef, pork, or shrimp. The coconut bun is stab-your-neighbor good. Good price as well. The staff is hit or miss, friendly one visit, rude the next. I do not always care about that, though, as long as the food is good.
Menu - Noodles are great. House chow fun with gravy and e-fu noodle are great. Otherwise, go wild. Pick your favorite choice and then try everything around it for fun.
(5 stars on good staff days. 3 stars on really bad staff days. Average is 4 stars)"
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Great place for Happy Hour and Brunch on the Weekend. Funky interior - garage turned into fine dining. Head upstairs and you will feel away from the crowd. The Moroccan meatballs are well spiced, well proportioned and a nice surprise to the palate. Drinks are well poured and whet the appetite. Uptown is well represented by this local restaurant (that is the sister of Phx Public Market)."
-i0DZp5-KT54MpqvREmqXQ,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Excellent Vietnamese food hidden away in a Grocery store. Be sure to explore the menu. Start with some Pho (try out the real pronunciation - 'Fuh'), with BBQ pork or fish ball (oh yeah, I said fish ball, yum). Then move on to some DIY food prep with the apps you build yourself. Rice paper you moisten slightly, then stuff to make your own Spring Rolls (get the beef wrapped in grape leaves, beyond tasty). Great place, great food. Go shopping after you are done..."
-yQHIYKXH3HAdhh1W52OMQ,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,5,"Good food, good drink, good people. We have followed these guys from the days when Sit...Stay was behind Stinkweeds at Central and Camelback. They work hard to bring the best to your table. Schreiner's Fine Sausages. Local Brew and Spirits. Now with Donuts. If they had a room in the back, I would move in. Try everything, especially stuff you think does not work. Start with the Bear - dog or doughnut, then Fried Green Tomato Stack, and add on a Beer Float. Your tastebuds will mouth kiss you for coming here.

It WILL be yummy. And may enhance your date night."
g_6gQKZxj9HHbTa1OaUtnQ,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,3,"Excellent food. Good prices. Nice balance of flavor and heat. Have not had a bad meal, have just had to wait a little longer than I wanted. Plan to relax and you will be fine. Actually would give this place four stars if they could be more consistent on time. Good service otherwise. Maybe food that tastes this good deserves some grace. Maybe I should be able to embrace the moment of peace it offers. Maybe I should go to the Fast Food place down the street if I am in such a hurry. Maybe...

Food and Service -

Wait time -"
5DDumAHRKumv3gZiPKW6iw,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Excellent alternative to froyo and the normal packed coffee house in the neighborhood. Nice atmosphere. Easy place to work on papers or meet with friends. Good coffee, good sweets, and good frozen treats. Try a tsoynami with some frozen fruit and be open to trying some vegan quiches. Parking is scarce, so be sure to carpool. Get your hipster fix in an unpretentious way."
atLCqV8RGezSxgLzcM9HaQ,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,5,"Real food, great value. This is one of the places that remembers its heritage and yet caters to modern tastes. Go wild on the menu, try something you do not already know about, especially the Aguas Frescas - fresh fruit drinks to die for. Also, head over to the far wall and pick out some pastries you wish your nana made. Great service, even better food. Get something to go or stay for awhile, your mouth will thank you."
HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Excellent Chinese food. Real Chinese. (Get the Chinese Menu) Bitter melon soup is sooo good and just feel free to explore. You can bring your friend who is not adventurous as well, they have good Americana Chinese. Definite hole in the wall, however like so many good food AND good service."
vF7uhHELpV2mDo9VkDNosg,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,3,"Good diner fare. Big omelettes with lots of filling. This is one of those fair diners with good food at good prices. Not our favorite place. Not the BEST diner EVER. However good breakfast, good grilled tilapia."
cXgXRqB40CGHEMKQgxLDTg,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"$10 bucks gets you any pizza you create and a drink. Not a bad deal. Be creative on your choices. Get pesto with the marinara, then load up on capicola and spicy Italian sausage. Or no sauce with extra garlic and anchovies. Good food. Try a Bellini, tasty."
Lm61pehc-oyqR6DBAAQNCg,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Still a good place to grab some brunch. Always a good special on the board to be had. Service is always good, even when the wait staff is curt. Forget 'Donnie's' up on Peoria and come here instead. True gem in Glendale."
nFVqjh-JCOuV2Uci1ZfJ_Q,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,5,"Macaroni Salad. Let me say it again, Macaroni Salad. These guys excel at good food at good prices. Tried half the menu, enjoyed, now ready for the other half and expect more of the same. Get an Hawaiian Aloha Maid Natural Soda while you wait, and then order something to go, because you will crave it later that week. Good service, quick food that is not 'fast' in flavor. That great middle of quick and tasty."
cTZmf7B-4yciMc1WKiCVOA,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Be ready for yum. These guys hit all the right notes - quality food with no pretense. This is what diner food should be. Get a nice drink to start, then order the special. Whatever it is, it is what you should have that day. Scratch made tomatillo gravy, brunch burger with spicy ketchup, etc. Cool staff are eager to please, chef that knows his stuff - works the flattop like the pro he is."
utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ,7KMO5yGSx5Vypb-jzHVTrQ,4,"Food good, service is good. Be prepared to WAIT. Try the pancake flight and Bennie combo with another cake subbed for the browns (at least 4 us, I like crisper browns) on the first visit so u get to know the menu. Brewmosa was good (beer and oj). Good shade outside, sat comfortably outside on a warm September mid morn."
5VXsbrqyJx0a4iaa43RNFA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,2,"So I have eaten at this place twice and the reason I give it 2 stars is primarily the atmosphere and very friendly staff. The ambience is cool, fresh and bright. The staff is very attentive and nice.
Now to the food. Very mediocre. Had a hard time believing it was on the food network. The Wolfpack was just a plain tasting meal. And the second time I went I ordered chicken fried steak. The gravy was sooo bland I scraped it off the meat. The home fries were also kind of lackluster compared to other breakfast eateries in Gilbert such as Liberty Market or the Farmhouse just as examples.
What really had me miffed on the second visit, my friend and I sat at the bar. Shortly after we arrived another couple sat next to us. We all waited about 20 minutes maybe a little more for our food. But the couple that sat next to us got their meal paid for bc of the wait and my friend and I didn't. We waited just as long and also had a single item each. Just didn't seem right but all I can say is that I have no imnmediate plans to return. I believe two chances is enough especially after this incident."
c7lAaz-pW58i1h1rSlyqcw,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,5,"Great simple menu. Great pricing. Had the lunch special today with my husband and it was super good. The rice and beans were very tasty. My usual pet peeve about empanadas is that they are either too greasy, too doughy, or the insides are greasy and tasteless. Soooo not the case here. I had the potato and the cheese one and both were very tasty, not greasy, and not doughy. I will definitely be back."
0vdw9E5zzYDNsW_smjBmHA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,4,"Tasty and cheap has always been my personal motto. I came upon the place by accident. I haven't lived in Arizona long and had been craving pan dulce (mexican sweet bread) for a while. Then all of a sudden I am just driving around and see the sign. I am greeted very warmly and appreciate the basic menu, and they also had a substantial supply of pan dulce. The food was very good. I had the shrimp tacos and a burrito.The burrito wasn't overly huge and the tacos not greasy at all. The salsa was fantastic with just the right amount of kick. I didn't leave feeling overly stuffed and gross like I do sometimes when I have mexican food. An hour later I tried a piece of pan dulce I picked up and that was great too. I was very pleased with my under $10 meal and 4 pieces of pan dulce."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,4,"Parking does suck as well as service sometimes on a busy night, especially during the ASU school year. But, over the years this is still a great place to get a great beer with some food and just hang out. And yes, service is great too. I try not to come during peak hours so I can really sit and enjoy the patio during the fall/winter. Oh, and did I mention the amazing ice cream cake option for dessert. Yessir."
WAWWO9PCDTDiXwkKdkw5yA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,5,"Very clean, nice ambience. Was greeted very warmly. The ramen was soooo flavorful. All of my friends ordered ramen so I had a chance to taste the different kinds offered on the menu. Each one had very flavorful broth and noodles. I also ordered a side of chicken teriyaki with my ramen which was also very tasty and flavorful. And the best part, the chicken was not smothered in a ton of sticky teriyaki sauce. I will definitely be back for more."
-QgX4QofONhh6XFZ4Zbnvw,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,5,"I've been coming here for years, and still love it. Great reasonably priced and fresh sushi, awesome sake menu for those who appreciate a good Japanese sake with your meal. It's also a plus to see the owners every time I go to the place and they are always so friendly and welcoming. Tempura ice cream is delish."
mFrkBUEyop52sYWAQhBm5A,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,4,"Had breakfast there with friends for the first time on Saturday and was impressed. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We never had to ask for refills for coffee or water. Sure it's a bar, but it smelled like cinnamon and was way clean. We shared a cinnamon roll and it was amazing. Huge fresh roll of fluffy with a wonderful not too overly sweet cream cheese frosting. My country breakfast was very good except the gravy for the biscuit. That was pretty bland...ok very bland. But they didn't give us a problem when we asked for separate checks which is always a plus in my book. It was also very reasonable for the amount of food served. My friends and I will be back."
3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,3,The customer service here is awesome! The sandwiches and hamburgers are awesome. I like that there is rice pudding available amongst the other delicious cold case items. Here's my problem...the breakfast blows. Now I have tried breakfast items here more than once so this review is not based on a one time experience. I have not been impressed with the breakfast other than the biscuit. It's very average and super pricey for the portion you end up receiving. There coffee bar is also pretty pricey for what you end up receiving. The only thing I don't mind paying for other than the hot tea service is the hot chocolate because it's very delish and comes in a bowl.
NlymcSxDnjtCLyGvmMoyFg,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,5,"Hands down, most delicious Hawaiian food I've had since moving to The Phoenix area. I have dreams about the macaroni/potato salad."
_MVSmAYSl4RkgXBg5e8JaQ,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,2,"Food is good. For what they charge, yes portions are a bit on the small side. I have been here on two occasions. One time I ordered the silver dollar pancakes which I really enjoyed. The other time, I ordered bacon pancakes which were just ok. The place is clean and they offer a nice looking menu with an array of breakfast items, but the quality of customer service is bad. I don't like going somewhere where I feel like I am being processed through. On my second visit especially, my friend and I had arrived an hour and a half before closing. Now I fully understand that people are tired but when chairs are being stacked and the register is being closed out before the closing time is a bit much, especially when the server and manager kept coming up to our table asking us to hurry up and pay. We had just received our food and had them in our face demanding our money. May come back here, may not."
ELUUibdDcrZHyvE-e-QsVw,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,4,"I have yet to have an unpleasant experience here. Besides the fantastic beer options, everything I have ordered from here I enjoy from salads to sandwiches and pasta. I mean a nice tasty cheeseburger with fries(or salad if you choose to avoid fried objects) and a pint of beer for $9. How can you say no? I just wish it was open a little bit later."
vsFFbN71ehRCp46KeR5RdQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,2,"We have heard about this place for quite a while. Given the friend reviews and the look of the building, one would think it was more of an upscale breakfast joint. Instead we were greeted to a large open restaurant that was very loud and with what seemed like a group of robot teenagers running the place. The sense of urgency (to be seated, take order, etc) was there (as they rushed us through every bit of our visit) but with no individuality or customer service. Autopilot.

First, we are shown to a table that is not ready for us and we are left standing in the middle of the dining room. Very awkward. Then the waitress asks us what we would like to drink. Coffee for him, coffee for me and.....had to get her to stop the robot talk (and almost flag her down as she walked away) so I could order an OJ. Since it was our 1st time, we took a bit of time to decide what to eat. The open menu on the table with my face buried in it should have been the first clue I wasn't ready to order. But the robot-server came by 3 times ready to write everything down; and I mean everything, spelled out and repeated as she wrote. Wow...

The food was OK. A little on the bland side, but tasty. The chorizo was very flavorful and the sausage gravy was excellent. The menu is extensive with something for everyone - French toast, crepes, pancakes, skillets, specialties and more). The food came out very fast which was good because we were hungry!

Maybe my expectations were too high in general. I truly thought this place would have been nicer. If I want my check delivered to me in the middle of my meal, I would have eaten at Denny's. I was shocked and surprised."
xIbtbAJLWLNZcqfqF4f-Nw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Love the local beers on draft!  We tried a variety of stuff from the small plate menu.  I've been wanting to try the bone marrow since they opened!  It's a little chunkier than I expected, but very good.  My hubby had the pork tacos and loved them.  We also tried the eggplant fries - great with the dipping sauce provided.  We will definitely be back."
HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Not bad!  We stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago.  My hubby had eaten here before so he showed me the ropes, so to speak.  They have a large menu and it can be quite overwhelming, especially if you go during lunch and everyone else seems to know what they want.  If you have to stare at the menu for a while, it's best to step aside or you will be trampled.  Not knowing what I was doing, the employees were quick to suggest things and very helpful and patient.  The food was good, but a little bland.  Spice it up a little people!  It's a Mexican food restaurant!"
DMyoxEaTGTakZxWgh1D5bw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"While strolling through the Biltmore, we came across this restaurant.  I liked how the menu revolved around dishes that are lower in calories then most restaurants.  This didn't come with a compromise in taste either.

The service was very good both at the hostess stand (friendly) and with our waiter.  They were a little busier than I think they expected so the get the check took a bit, but you could see everyone running around being busy so no worries.

I ordered the veggie sandwich.  It was quite messy and falling apart, but so worth it.  It was very tasty.  I didn't like how it came with a plain jane salad though with a little too much dressing on it.  I wish there were other options.  My hubby had the buffalo chili and after trying a taste we both agreeded that was one of the best chilis we've ever had.

We aren't in the area that often, but I haven't forgotten the restaurant and would like to return to try other items."
jvnMR2D-YVtnQWCP4PN_kw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"We found this little place on yelp when looking for a new place in the ""hood"" to go for lunch.  We are hooked!  They have outdoor tables, indoor tables and an old school counter to sit down at where they cook the food right there.  There is plenty of staff on hand so the service is GREAT!  The food selection is mostly healthy so they have something for everyone:  Soup, salads and sandwiches.  I believe they serve breakfast but we are never up in time on the weekends to try the brunch.  They have hot sandwiches (Panini's) or cold sandwiches and plenty of sides including macaroni salad, pasta salad, potato salad, chips, etc.
They also have quite a selection of soft drinks and the place also doubles as a mini-mart, kind of.  You can stop in and get pre-packaged food and drink.  The only thing I wish they had was a 1/2 sandwich with a 1/2 salad or cup of soup.  My hubby and I sometimes get a sandwich and a salad and split.  Definitely worth trying out.  The prices are normal - $6 - $9 for a salad or sandwich.  The sides are extra.  Try the green tea ice tea.  It is absolutely refreshing on a hot day.  I could drink gallons!"
wJY74R0zAgjxvBf-d4gm9g,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Gonna be short and sweet!

Stopped in here with some friends to grab something quick.  We all sat at the bar.  Great service, great food.  Definitely will be back!

Meatballs - yup!
Jalapeno Popper Dip - Not too spicy, but we have a high tolerance.  Very good!
Bruschetta - We tried the Mozz.  Very good.
Cocktails - reasonably priced and strong

Will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu.  Worth stopping in!"
PpnHlk95jbeK261RHuXflw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Wow! Great food, great service. We were lucky to get in to the restaurant without a reservation. Not that sitting at the bar would be a bad thing because their happy hour (only served at the bar) is very good.

We started out with the lamb appetizer, which was a small meal in itself. The lamb was cooked to perfection and went well with the arugula salad. We decided there were too many items on the menu that sounded good so we ordered 3 more items all to share.

My hubby had never tried the green chili pork stew so that was the first must-have. It was excellent. We also ordered the green chili mac & cheez and the burger. I don't know what the sauce was on the burger but it was good. The burger was cooked perfectly (medium) and was about 8 inches tall! I would definitely split the burger. It was huge and came with string shoe french fries, enough for at least 4 meals. With all the food we ordered, we had enough leftovers for another meal, or two.

Overall the experience (especially the food) was phenom and I would recommend trying this place out over and over. Make sure to make a reservation."
Qv0OEziLJwyAqcgtrTsA4w,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Good food; good service; consistent and accommodating.  They are an institution in Chicagoland and keep the quality high here in Arizona. The only downfall are the locations.  The original one at 16th & Indian School has a tiny-hard-to-navigate-through parking lot which makes it difficult to get in and out.  The North Scottsdale one had a small parking lot as well and heavy traffic but it's near the Walmart so you can always park in the corner of that lot and walk over.  When you want Chicago-style food, you'll do anything to get it.  Thanks Luke for bringing a bit of home to Arizona!"
OugQjN04sQNahWzYEdTExQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"I worked on Central Ave for a number of years in the past and never saw this place.  And it's been there for 60 years!!!  I'm slackin' in my mom & pop shop dex duties!

Had to run some errands in the area so I Yelped sandwich shops looking for one I had never been to before and came across this one.  I looked at their menu and immediately saw a bunch of items that appealed to me.  I still couldn't believe I had never seen this before, especially since I'm sooooo in love with Cheese!

The poor people behind the counter must have thought I was nuts!  I get the impression they are used to people knowing what they want when they walk in the door rather than having me stare at the menu for a good 10 minutes, again.  To my credit, the only lunch meat I ate growing up was a slice of bologna once a year and I've eaten the same Subway sandwich for 20 years so this whole deli thing is new to me.  I asked about a number of sandwiches and they were very helpful in answering all my questions.  ""You can have that hot or cold"".  ""Sourdough or rye"".

I settled on  a chicken salad sandwich, surprisingly.  I usually shy away from ""salad"" sandwiches because most places use too much mayo, or there's funky ingredients like walnuts or raisins or grapes.  I was feeling mighty brave today I guess.  The sandwich was AWESOME!  Great flavor and not drowning in goo.  They have a huge selection of chips or you can try their homemade potato or macaroni salad.

I can't wait to bring the hubby back for him to try."
FirWX-Ep5203TsdiGgShKg,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"This was my first time at the Vig - haven't been to the original yet either.  We met some friends for brunch.  Not bad.  The food was a little more out of the box than we expected but good.  They easily and happily made a couple minimal substitutions (not ready for chicken and eggs for breakfast) and the server was very nice.  It's interesting how they turned the old bank into a restaurant.  Love the natural light coming in over the bocce ball court.  Would have loved to play bocce ball but there were kids everywhere playing with the balls.  It's a little loud inside, but not deafening.  It's definitely not a place I would frequent - seemed a little cold - but no regrets on checking it out."
hNsRj2nXuALlJS4Op-8MmA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,1,"Stopped by for just a cocktail and to check the place out.  The bartender was rude and short with us.  After three attempts of trying to figure out what she was saying, we got it!  We didn't even get a chance to look at the menu as we couldn't finish our cocktails fast enough.  There was not a very welcoming atmosphere, apparently unless you are a regular, and the ""smoking patio"" is a joke.  Because of the non-welcoming atmosphere, we won't be back."
oZcbn7ENit23xbCsyu9xbA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"The food here is very good. Definitely not old school traditional Japanese that my dad was looking for. The quality of the food is consistent and tasty! It's worth checking out. Service wasn't too bad either. It's a little pricey but not overly so. The first 3 items my dad asked for they didn't have. No pickles, no breaded chicken and I can't remember the 3rd. There is plenty on the menu to chose from though. Don't let my dad's taste-buds shy you away. Definitely worth a trip. Great date night destination too. The atmosphere is a little upscale but still casual and quite relaxing."
oSI3qAZI_zhd91twB-ivqA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"Let me preface by saying I'm not one to seek out Italian food for din din.  We had a family dinner and this was a restaurant in the middle of where everyone lives. We have been to the one on 64th and Greenway for a birthday before as well, so we were a little familiar.  This restaurant (Glendale) is quite larger than the one in Scottsdale and decorated beautifully.  The staff was very friendly and courteous.

The app menu was a little weird.  Some apps were suited for 2 people and others were suited for our table of 8.  Meaning, if you and a date wanted the carpaccio or the calamari, it would be enough for a meal, but the Ravioli plate only came with 4.  Also, don't miss out by reading the menu too fast - the apps are separated by cold and hot.  i.e. there are two sections on the first page.  We ordered both the carpaccio and the calamari by request of our waiter and were pleased with both.

The portion sizes are decent and not too large.  Plus they offered a shot of sambucca at the end of the meal, on the house.  Overall not bad, but it was a little pricey for the quality and portion sizes.  ($10.95 for the Ravioli app)."
7IEQBmoEe7ne20rp5Aup-w,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Most everyone knows ""Cheers"". This place is Cheers on steroids! It's probably 3 times the size, but everyone still knows your name. The bartenders are seasoned vets and there's always one of the owners there making you laugh and/or making you drink!

The food here is incredible. I would recommend the chicken tenders (chix breast marinated in Italian dressing over night and lightly breaded) which can be served with veggies or fries. They are so tender and juicy! I would also recommend the sliders. My favs are the tenderloin toast sliders. Their salads are good; brunch on Sundays is good. I've never had a bad meal here. Definitely try the clam chowder on Fridays but get there by 6pm to #1 secure a bowl of chowder and #2 secure a seat at the bar.

The crowd is a little on the older side at times, but we are working on changing that! There's always music on (overhead or live band) and they have Wii bowling on Monday nights. The TV's are plentiful and there is a nice smoking/drinking patio which allows you to watch everything going on inside. Great people watching place too.

Once you've been there, you are family. The bartenders will remember your name and/or what you drink the next time you are in. Check it out and remember the sliders!"
tcgmfbWugkHI3FRrjlH6lQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here.

Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!"
Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"My hubby LOVES this place!  We just moved into the area and were looking for a close breakfast place.  The food it good (not 100% to my liking but that's just my taste buds).  The staff is very friendly and they have a few tables outside for when the weather is nice.  Inside is a large, high-ceiling one-room restaurant.  It's clean and consistent.  Again, don't let my taste buds defer you from trying this place out."
CElwRv4CtK56NljAuCwepw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"While I'd like to give it more stars, I just can't for two reasons:  The food was delish but not memorable and it's a chain.

Upon entering we noticed the atmosphere was a little mixed.  Meaning the decor is a little cold, but the employees were very warm and inviting.  We decided to sit at the bar.  We started out with the Firecracker rolls.  Interesting and not bad.  A little on the bland side.  We split one of the Neapolitan pizzas, which was also not bad.  The service was friendly.  This location (16th St.) seems to have quite a few regulars as they were popping in and out throughout our stay.

If we are in the neighborhood we might try it again, but there are so many good restaurants in that hood..."
Kx_lrGQDNXT0owqBgs2how,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,We've been here a couple times to see some friends play music.  Great outdoor patio!  We've had good service too.  Employees were very friendly and welcoming.  We will be back.
tt9Jy2HBhkKpEG3KxFX0fQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"We yelped ""brunch"" and found this cute little place. After reading the reviews we decided to try it. (Plus I thought we'd hit everything in the neighborhood.) It's very small but quaint. The food was great, service was great and the portion size was perfect. Not too much, not too little. It seemed most stuff was ala carte so if you would like potatos just ask for a side. They also have a bakery case with tasty looking goodies and they cater. Worth checking out."
GMcit-31kUNFVulQGwSEwA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,Kind of like an upscale Denny's.  The menu is HUGE and has something for everyone.  They can even make it spicy for you!  The service is quick and friendly.  Typical diner though...
bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Way cool concept!  I love the build your own burger and they have the BEST turkey burger I've ever had.  Took my parents there for brunch a couple weeks ago.  Didn't realize they had brunch even!  My mom really enjoyed making her own omlette.  I stuck with the turkey burger.  ;-)  We tried the fried pickles and they were good, but I prefer the jalapeno pickle spears rather than the dill.  I love how they bring out the home-made fries with the parmesan cheez on top in the beginning!  We were fortunate enough this time to not have a wait.  I would recommend calling ahead to see how backed up they are - the new outdoor seating area should help with this too.  Sometimes, it's worth the wait!"
HVyxN-G8NOfUHo2cEnilVw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Friendly staff! I love the concept of make your own. There are so many choices here. The reason for the 4 star is sometimes the veggies aren't fresh. The zucchini can be mushy and the shrooms a little dark, for example.  But overall, the quality of food is good."
_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Wow!  What a happy hour!  The food here is incredible and during happy hour all the small plates are only $5 each!  This gave us an opportunity, over a few visits, to try almost everything on the small plate menu.  The first time we were there, we ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the steak skewers and the brie mushroom toast.  For two people this was a meal in itself!  We were full by the end.

The bacon wrapped scallops, the tenderloin toast and the oysters were ordered on the next trip.  Thinking this couldn't nearly be enough food, we ordered the chicken tacos too.  The oysters Rokerij were incredible!  I'm not a big fan of oysters - in fact, can't eat them unless they are covered with lots of gooey stuff.  These were a step above Rockefeller!  The bacon-wrapped scallops and the shrimp both are served with three different sauces on the plate.  It would be best if you tried all three.  My favorite is the spicy red sauce.  They are all very good and everything tastes better with bacon!  The chicken tacos were not my favorite.  There was a funky taste to them that I can't pinpoint.  I'm not against trying them again...

The bartenders are great!  Can't beat the service here (at least in the downstairs bar).

Happy Hour is only from 3pm to 6pm, which makes it hard to get there after working until 5pm, and prices are only good if you are sitting at one of the bars (there is one upstairs and one downstairs).  The bartenders upstairs are attentive and for the most part friendly but not nearly as good as the bartenders downstairs.  They make you feel at home and will do everything to try to accommodate you and your party.  The new Richardson's is opening soon next door and we are looking forward to trying that.  But our heart is with Rokerij."
Wag4bnx38zJ4ihDn8-7--A,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"This down-to-earth, gritty neighborhood bar/grill should be a destination must-see for Scottsdale.  They will be celebrating their 35th year anniversary in October and there aren't many places that can claim this feat.  Even though I'm not a fan of country music, I must say this place is fun!  The bartenders are spot on and friendly.  The drinks are tasty, but the people watching is the BEST!  The bathroom is a little tiny but workable.  I haven't had a chance to eat there but my friends who have say the food is good.  Check out the bar on Sunday nights (Chris is bartending - awesome bartender!).  The house band is rockin' and it's always busy.  It's a great place to get rid of those Sunday night blues."
KOQw4e1rwCY5e0RnmB5rgQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"The last few times we have been here, we've sat upstairs at the bar.  Franco has always been our server so the last time we were there I asked him how long he had been working there - 35 years was the response.  Kudos Franco.

We have tried many items on the menu.  The food is mediocre, but satisfying and flavorful.  The lavosh is incredible.  Stay away from the cajun chicken quesadilla (very messy and only cheez and chix) and the buffalo wings scared me a bit (not a fan of pulling apart pieces of chicken).  I would recommend the veggie lavosh or the cajun lavosh.  We have had the fruit plate (LOTS of fruit - great for a hot summer day), and various sandwiches.

The prices aren't too bad - the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  The other employees are generally friendly and helpful.  It's a great place for late night eats."
DncR06kFZ_u2O4NlbPPE4w,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"This place never disappoints!  They have a scale of 1-7 for hotness/spiciness in the food.  We always go for 5, sometimes 6.  It's always consistent and spicy but also flavorful.  My favorite dish is the Singapore Noodles.  Perfect every time and enough for 2 meals, at least."
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"We heard mixed reviews about the place so we weren't sure what to expect when we dined there. We were very pleasantly surprised. We started out with the goat cheese app (a recommendation from our awesome server Jose). My hubby is not a huge fan of goat cheese, but with the added ingredients mixed in (pesto, tomato) it was a hit! The menu has a wide variety of foods from brick oven baked pork chops to roasted salmon (which was phenomenal!). I left it up to Jose to choose the glass of wine. He made another great suggestion of the Burgans Albariño.

There were multiple items on the menu that appealed to both of us so we will definitely be back to try more!"
75u8X_saAIETRHgpECi8YA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Cool little place tucked away in an old strip mall.  The ""bar"" top consisted of three high wood table shaped in a ""U"".  Neat idea!  The best part....you can actually get a flight of salsa!!  They have eight salsas to choose from and you can get a flight of 3 or 5.  The southwestern had some flavor, but not spicy.  The habanero was spicy but still had flavor.  The Chipotle was bomb!  We also split a taco plate with black beans and rice.  The tacos were huge!  The rice was excellent as well.  The service was great too.  We will be back."
iUHz8jIWjkbx6pXsTUNIaw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,Great sports bar!  The place is huge and can be a little loud.  There are TV's everywhere you look so there is no bad seat in the house.  The service is incredible and the food is amazingly great!  They have a thin crust pizza with a sauce that tastes just like Lou Malnati's in Chicago.  Try the vodka pasta too.  Never had a bad meal here.  Ask for Lori - best server EVER!
-faYl3ejjjm7ciR_j1ke7A,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"I'm not a fan of corporate restaurants, but we know quite a few people that work at this location so we like to stop by and see them once in a while.  I don't know if all RL's are like this, but they seem to hire the best kids here!  All the staff is hard working and seem to work together to make sure your meal comes out in a timely manner, etc.  Love the grilled fish menu (trying to stay on the healthy side) and they will make modifications to your order without hesitation or grief.  I wish there were more of a selection of sides, (asparagus or something on the healthy side) but that also might just be my taste buds."
HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Love love love!!!  Great service, great food, great drinks, great wine.  We sat outside on the patio on a Saturday night, listened to live music and shared some wine and food.  Very romantic setting, and peaceful.  The appetizers are not truly appetizers...they are MEALS!!  Had the ahi tuna tostadas...couldn't eat anything after that.  The portions are large, so split if you can.  The food is very very very very good.  We ended up taking some friends there a few days later.  They loved it too.  Love the atmosphere.  This is a perfect place for a nice romantic dinner on the patio.  Absolutely make reservations first."
aJR1iUWwNVBM692gq7adBA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Stumbled across this place when my hubby was out of town and I wasn't feeling well.  Great pricing, close to home and they deliver!  The egg rolls are HUGE, you get twice as many crab rangoon as other places and the fried rice seems homemade, just made, fresh.

The first time I ordered delivery they said 45 min.  Totally fine.  It was a busy night.  They showed up in 15.

The second time we thought they were closing soon and felt bad ordering for delivery.  The gentleman said it wasn't a problem.  They expanded their hours as they are continuing to get busier and busier.

This is def our new spot!"
IohmLyQ-spRYgGldapMSyg,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Love love love Schlotzskys. I have frequented the one on 90th and Shea. It's kind of hard to get to only because that intersection is so jam-packed all the time. The food is great and consistent. I only gave it 4 stars because the staff is not the friendliest and sometimes forget things (no onions, horseradish, etc.). This is the closest one to my house. If it were to be any closer, I'd be in big trouble."
2OkYkQRItlqbKw9Mz7flCA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Awesome place!  For a local neighborhood Mexican restaurant, Julio G's can't be beat!  The service is always consistent and good.  The staff is friendly and the food comes out WAY fast, which is good because then you don't have time to eat too many chips.  The have changed ownership in the last year or so and with that came some improvements.  I'm not sure where they are purchasing their meats but it has definitely improved.  The chicken especially.  I love the combo platter in the middle of the menu.  You can pick and choose and try out different items all served with rice and beans.  The green chile tamale is a favorite as are the fajitas and the Tijuana tacos!  The leftovers actually taste good too."
1d6c6Q2j2jwVzBfX_dLHlg,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"We've been meaning to check out this place since they made the Rep's Best years ago.  On a whim we decided to stop by for dinner.  The wine selection was so large but the server was able to recommend a wine.  We split the mac & cheez, which was delish!  They we both ordered the espresso-rubbed filet.  My new thing is to try the dish as it was meant to be prepared rather than alter my order and driving the server crazy.  Not a big fan of this one.  You can order the steak without the rub, which I will try next time.  The menu was quite eclectic and next time we are definitely going to try their special mushroom dish (which you can also order in a smaller portion).  The food overall was very rich but the portions were just the right size.  Worth checking out this place.

Quick tip - it's easiest to valet park in that area; otherwise you could potentially be driving around for a while looking for a spot on the street.  Most of the valet guys are going to college, so think of it as a donation to their college fund."
-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,2,"Let me preface this by saying I have been in the service industry for the better part of 20 years. I understand how restaurants work as far as service, reservations, repeat customers, etc. I was so extremely disappointed in this place. Here's my story:

While looking for a centrally-located place for the fam to dine, we came across this pizza parlor and remembered seeing it on TV. On their website it states they take reservations for parties of 6 or more so I called to make a reservation. The gentleman that answered the phone took our name and phone number and then proceeded to let us know the rules: 1. They won't seat you until your entire party is there (not really understandable since they pushed tables together and could have easily separated them should our party not all show up) 2. They only hold the table for 10 minutes (kind of understandable since so many people flake out on reservations, but 10 min is a little short, especially if there's traffic) and 3. We had 1.5 hours to eat because another party was coming in. He asked if #3 was an ok time-frame. I said it was up to his kitchen and how fast they can pump out the food - they did good.  He said there was only one table in the restaurant that could sit 6 or more.  However, when we arrived they were pushing tables together on the patio to accommodate a party of 6 and they had another large party just in side the patio and we sat in a different location, so not sure how he thought there was only 1 table for large parties.  Plus each table is a 2-top and can be combined with x number of other tables to accommodate - there was plenty of room inside the restaurant.

So after hanging up I already felt like they didn't really want us there. Four of the six of us arrived a slight bit early.  We introduced ourselves as the reservation and they promptly corrected us by saying they don't make reservations, they just hold the table and our table would be given away at 6:10 if the entire party was not here. Right at 6pm we called the other two who informed us they were 3.6 miles away (according to their GPS) but they still wouldn't seat us. We explained they were only 7 min away, but they said it didn't matter and asked us to wait outside in 100 degree weather sweating our a$$e$ off. They never offered water or anything to drink. Just literally shuffled us out the door and proceeded to ignore us for the next ~7 minutes. Sign #2 they didn't really want us there.

Since we were in 3 cars and not familiar with downtown Glendale, we decided to stick it out. The other two arrived and we were seated back by the bathrooms. Sign #3 they didn't really want us there.

The restaurant was not packed, nor did it get packed while we were there so I'm not sure why they couldn't seat us or even let us wait inside in the air conditioning. The ONLY reason this place rec'd 2 stars rather than the 1/4 I would have preferred to give it is because of our server, Sandy. She was AMAZING! We wanted wine so she made some suggestions for both red and white. The table took her up on all that she suggested. She was polite, timely, funny, professional; she just rocked. She saved the dinner for all of us. Thank you Sandy!

The food was fairly good. We ordered the fried ravioli (REALLY good) and bruschetta as apps. The salads came next (ok to split with someone - they are fairly good size). Definitely ask for the dressing on the side. We couldn't eat half of ours because it was absolutely drowning in dressing. The pizza was pretty good. Be careful of the pies that have garlic on them - they are large pieces of garlic so you definitely want to make sure your date likes garlic too. ;-)

We won't be back nor would we recommend this place to friends. We will tell them our story and let them make up their own mind. And we will definitely have them call ahead to see if Sandy is working because she really did save the night."
YiuI4YHJnrl9898gE50_ow,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"This restaurant never disappoints! The first time we walk in was at 10:30pm on a Sunday night, there was healthy stuff on the menu and there was a Dave Matthews Band concert on the big screen. I thought to myself...is this heaven?

In this neighborhood, the only food establishment open after 9pm is Jack-in-the-Box. To be able to eat a late dinner and have it be healthy is a blessing to those of us that work a little later than normal and don't cook at home much. Their menu consists of apps, soups/salads, sandwiches, pizzas, entrees, wine and more. Over the past 1 1/2 years, I have had the opportunity to try quite a few things. Some of my favs are the Chilean sea bass, the hummus, mahi mahi tacos, stuffed chicken breast, mac & cheese... the list goes on. Nothing is over $20. The choices are very eclectic - from fish to Jamaican jerk chicken to meatloaf. There is something for everyone.

I would recommend starting with the hummus. It's a trio of roasted red pepper, garlic and jalapeno/cilantro served with pita chips. The flavors of each just explode with every bite. The Floyd's House Salad, as simple as it may be, is just the right combination of flavor and texture that make this house salad stand out. The Chilean sea bass is served on a bed of roasted red pepper cous cous with a creamy artichoke sauce drizzled over. Again, the combination of flavor and texture make this dish one of the best on the menu.

I'm personally not a fan of meatloaf, but my hubby and father seem to love this recipe (and dad is really picky).  The NY Strip was prepared perfectly and the mix of veggies complements the various entrees they come with.

If you are in this neighborhood, or even if you're not, check this place out.  The service is always spectacular and the food is consistent."
wfxmuA7LbKZKVLV58EiWBw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Great staff! (We have had Deb, Chris & Randy the few times we have been there) Decent food (however a little over-priced compared to some mom&pop shops out there). Friendly.  They just started opening for lunch by us.  Not the first place I think of when I think steak (see TexAZ), but closer to home and pretty good!"
jDHDb20vTRKdJou7XE1DjA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"This was our first time here and we were quite impressed!  The atmosphere was unique (high top, nice looking tables in the bar, a bar you could sit at, tables of various sizes throughout, a couple booths and a separate, glassed in room for dining).  People of all styles would feel comfortable here.  The menu is quite large and was overwhelming until our AWESOME waiter explained everything to us.  The food was great and there are quite a few more items on the menu that we would like to try.  What made the entire meal was our server James.  He knew his stuff!  He suggested some wines; some we liked, some we didn't.  The ones we didn't like he took back and suggested another glass.  We never waited on anything and he kept us in the loop about the status of all the different small plates we ordered (there was 6 of us)

The idea of a mushroom bar is unique in itself.  I like how you can pick one large or 3 smaller mushrooms.  The choice of toppings is incredible!  I gave this restaurant only 4 stars because we were only there once.  Even though we don't live close, we will be back and I would think the # of stars would raise to 5.  Especially if we get James as our server again."

The restaurant is under new ownership so new menu, upgraded decor, etc.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by multiple members of the staff.  We were dressed kind of casual so we sat at the bar rather than a table.  There was a funny regular sitting at the bar that helped us choose the first course:  The Parmesan Tuile.  We were very hesitant (hubby is not a fan of cheese) but the regular told us we wouldn't regret it. Well that didn't suck!  It's essentially the leaning tower of pisa made of cheese.  You know when the cheese in your grilled cheese sandwich oozes out the side right onto the flat top? That's what it's made of.  So hard to explain.  Just try it.  It comes with marinara and poblano dipping sauces.  The marinara is killer but the poblano...yum!

We decided to split a wedge salad.  They gave us the option of having it served chopped or the usual style.  I asked for it chopped but with the onions on the side.  The bartender said they use kind of like a pico de gallo so it's impossible to separate the onions.  No problem, I'll try it as-is.  Holy crap it was THE best wedge salad I've ever had!  Even with onions!  No joke.  Who knew pico would work that well on a wedge.

So many good choices for the main course!  My hubby chose the meatloaf, I chose the jambalaya.  (I'm a firm believer in the only thing that should come in a loaf is bread.) I did ask if they could spice it up a bit.  They were able to and it worked!  The meal was full of shrimp, chicken and sausage with a good heat and great taste.  Took half of it home and had if for lunch the next day.

Oh, almost forgot, the rose on the menu was killer.  We'll def be back!"
6Iu4YDjAPrDRRrPCt_E2zA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Love love love this place. We have been frequenting this place for about 10 years. It is a neighborhood staple. The food is always consistent, as is the service. The menu is small: steaks, chicken, shrimp, etc. They are famous for their chicken fried steak. I'm not a fan personally but that's just due to my taste buds. I've recommended the dish to many people who loved it.

Recommendation when ordering the chicken fried steak at dinner, ask for the lunch portion. It's a little smaller and you are more likely to be able to finish it. The dinner portion could feed a family of 4!

The filet is my fav but the strip is just as fab. If you make it to dessert the bread pudding is phenomenal. Ask for it a-la-mode. It has a whiskey sauce drizzled over it and it comes out very hot so the ice cream evens the temp out a bit.

If you haven't been here yet, you need to check it out. There is so much stuff on the walls that you always have something to look at. Great place for families and they can accommodate large parties (maybe not 25, but 8-15 definitely!)"
wcNvlrB5xSxzXex2M3UyvQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"It's out of my hood, but had to check it out anyway.  While waiting for a friend, I sat at the bar next to a gentleman that had recently been cut off.  Instead of asking him to leave, he hung around telling everyone how he had been cut off - and by everyone I mean anyone sitting at the bar and anyone that would answer his phone call. (He was obviously a regular - every bar has at least 1 of those, if you know what I mean)  I know the ""you have 30 minutes to secure a ride rule"", but his friends were there to take him, which means the 30 minutes does not apply.  Anyway, once I got a bartender's attention the service was good.  They were training someone new and she was very nice and polite.

I was told to order one of the hot pretzels so that's what I did.  Holy CRAP!  The sauce was not what I was expecting....it was every better!  I didn't have time to try anything else, but I will be back with my friend to try some other items.  The pricing wasn't bad, there were sports on the TV and there is a smoking patio.  Coolest thing:  TV's in the booths!"
p-8AMN9Q0qwym-3Pdle20Q,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,2,"We have been to 4 of their locations (3 in Phoenix & the one in Flagstaff).  The food is great and is usually fast and consistent.  For this review, let's focus on the Scottsdale/Shea location.  They were busy, as usual, but...

We waited 8+ minutes for the server to ask if we wanted drinks because she was at the table next to us the entire time talking about her personal life with some customers.  (She grew up in South Africa with her family and I think a twin sister until she was 9 and misses it terribly...)  When we wanted a refill, my husband (after a 15 min wait with no one coming to our table) got up and went to the bartender for refills.  She said she wasn't allowed to (direct quote).  The hummus came out as a large, we asked for a small.  If you have been here before, you know it usually takes 5-8 minutes for hummus.  We waited closer to 20 and then another 15 for our meal of a beef gyro and the spicy chicken wrap.  My beef gyro came out and it was disgusting.  The meat was crusty and dry.  I couldn't eat it even though I was starving.  The server brought the manager over to talk to us.  We should have taken that opportunity to let her in on everything, but we were too hungry and frustrated at this point and potentially not thinking clearly.  She comped the humus (was not necessary, for the record) and my meal  and then disappeared.

Another 20 minutes goes by, my hubby is done eating, we still don't have refills and just want to leave.  We had to get up and go find the manager so she could run our card.  This whole lunch took WAY over an hour and I left hungry and frustrated.  We have been to this location before but never had such poor service.  We probably won't be back to this location."
AyZePvrWz73d3B0hafFCKA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Wow!  This place is so tiny, but yet they are able to cram every important part of a bar into this little space.

#1 - Awesome bartender!  We went on a Saturday and Posey (not sure of the spelling) was serving us.  She joked around with us immediately and gave crap to some of the regulars, which was HYSterical!  We never waited for a drink.

#2 - Wings Wings Wings!  They were incredible.  They deep fry the FRESH chicken wings, then turn them in the sauce (many different flavors to choose from including suicide, a little mix of all) and then throw them on the grill.  I ordered the hot wings and they were both temperature hot and spicy hot - just perfect.

#3 - Small but still there smoking patio.

#4 - Satellite TV and football games on multiple TV's

Can't get much better than this.  This was our first time in and the regulars welcomed us as if we had been coming there for 10 years!  We will definitely be back.  The wings are just too awesome not to have again."
Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"This is the first time we've been there since they went all organic. The menu isn't as obnoxiously large as it was before (HUGE bonus!) but the food is just as good. We tried the whole wheat crust but our taste buds didn't like it too much. I love that there are options for those who are vegans, gluten free, etc. There is pretty much something for everyone. The pizza is not bad but you definitely have to be in the mood to try something new, especially if you are new to the ""foodie"" world like I am.

We started with the spinach/artichoke dip. Highly recommend it! It comes in an edible bread bowl with slices of pita, celery and carrots. The dip was good with all four options.

There were only two servers on at the time and the place was busy! We still never waited for a refill on drinks. We will be back."
gugN1sgyheBJ6aKtNcv_gQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"This is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is ""cursed"".  The turnover for businesses at this location is high.  But I think Oink is going to make it!  They were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee (need bigger cups) and the food took a couple minutes longer, but no worries.  Who I think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were serving, clearing plates, filling coffee.  Love to see that!

The menu is decent.  I'm not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in.  The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didn't realize this until after we finished eating!  So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!"
fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"My friend and I were hellbent on going to restaurant A. It's closed. After standing in their parking lot for 10 min we decided on the Village Tavern. She was more familiar with the place than I was. We walked in, sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by a friendly bartender. The woman sitting next to us, however, kept demanding his attention. Every time we started to ask a question or even order our first drink all we heard was ""Blah Blah Blah"" and our bartender was gone. A little frustrating. She quickly left and he was all ours! Our martini's were large and made perfectly. We order a couple appetizers (chilled sampler and the crab cake sliders, minus the bun). The chilled sampler was surprising. For the price there was quite a bit on there, and really good. The smoked salmon was definitely smoked! The sauces that came with the dish complimented the items perfectly, and I'm not a sauce person. The crab cakes were good, not incredible. They were served with a plain tartar sauce.

Next we order the chicken tacos off the regular app menu. Holy CRAP! These were the best chicken tacos I've ever had! What a perfect blend of seasoned (to perfection) chicken, guac, and lime crema with a tasty salsa. WOW! Three tacos come on the plate - it's more than a meal.

I was surprised at the reasonable prices, especially for the amount of food and the quality. Although our trip started out really crappy, it ended on a good note and we will be back."
HGLMe4y0y_VsBkDLdpfBLA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"We had a groupon for this place and were in the area so we decided to cash it in.  We sat at the bar.  It took a little bit for someone to notice us but after that the service was great.  The food was ok.  Not anything I would seek out again but our friends mentioned they go here for happy hour and love it so we would definitely try it again with them.

We started with the Papi's trio.  The salsa was great, the guac was great, but the queso dip was not very good.  Too much spinach.  I ordered the grilled chicken entree.  A little too much oil but nicely seasoned.

It's worth trying."
x8_NelKV1JY5S5bN7mWJuQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Amazing!  We stayed at the Biltmore over Christmas with an all-inclusive package.  With this package we were able to try a large variety of items on the menu.  The staff was incredibly friendly and recognized us by the 2nd day.  The first day we started off with the smashed avocados.  Great flavor - def not boring!  We also tried the pulled pork empanadas.  Not too much flavor, but not bad either.  During our stay we tried the pizza (late night and the pie was HUGE), the Burger (awesome taste) and the chicken and goat cheese flat.  All were very well prepared and had great flavor.  So maybe the reason the cheese pizza was incredible was because it was after cocktails, but really not bad for a resort.

Definitely need to try the FF prepared in duck fat.  We tried this one and the sea salt fries.  They were both good, but the duck fat fries had just that little something extra.

We ate Christmas dinner at F&A's also.  Very good again.  The best part was the table-side smores!

Overall our experiences were wonderful!  Even though most of our meals were eaten here, there is still more on the menu I'd like to try."
fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"I've never been a fan or Oregano's in the past - only eaten there a couple times in the last 10 years.  However, I was willing to try it again since it opened up near our hood.  They have changed the menu since the last time I was there.  For the better, that is.  We ended up stopping by the first week they were open and wow was it absolutely NUTS!  I ordered a deep dish (being from Chicago and seeing it's a hard time to find good deep dish in Arizona, had to try).  It was undercooked but edible.  Sometimes you can't judge on first impressions, especially since the restaurant just opened, so I went back the next week with a friend.  I order the deep dish again and it was awesome!  The crust was cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of seasoning.

We have been back numerous times since the first week.  The staff is very friendly and most are down-to-earth.  We have met bartenders Robin and Brooke - both incredible bartenders with incredible customer service and a senses of humor.  We have also met a couple servers, Shawn and Jill.  They were attentive, quick, polite, funny and made our experience worth coming back and asking to sit in their section.  We end up sitting at the bar most of the time though since there always seems to be seats there without a wait.

We have ordered takeout quite a bit (slice & salad).  It's a 50/50 chance whether they get the salad right for takeout though.  We've never had any problems with the food when we go in for lunch or dinner - only takeout.

The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars:
1.  The 50/50 chance of food being wrong or not cooked properly.
2.  The staff is GREAT!!  (other than that one time we sat for 17 minutes while the bartender hit on a girl on the other side of the bar.  Brooke came to our rescue)
3.  The front house receptionists don't always seem to work together and there's sometimes confusion about tables, etc and they are obnoxiously friendly, at times. :-)

Overall, they are a great neighborhood pizzeria and worth checking out.  Wish they delivered..."
DQXz0VTP6n14gKrop8xVvw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"Well, I had no idea this changed so much!  I was going in expecting a dark, all-wood, old-school restaurant.  The only thing the same is the name.   GREAT food though!

The food we had was wonderful though.  The pretzel with the beer cheese...YUM!  We also tried the Nosh board.  Not bad...not bad at all.  Our friends split the meatloaf and said it was one of the best they've ever had.  Some other friends had the green chili pork.  They said it was very good, could be spicier though.  Guess it depends on your tolerance level.

My hubby and I split the burger, of all things.  It was cooked perfect and tasted amazing!  Overall the food was delish!  I wish they had tried to keep some of the charm from the original place.  Right now it seems very cold and unwelcoming.  That said, the staff was the complete opposite.  The general manager seemed very involved in how all his customers were doing and the wait staff was very attentive and nice.  We most likely will be back at some point."
9meJA6ap0hf9pjmJPweaTA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Only 4 stars because I've only been there once.  We would have never known about this place if it weren't for Groupon. We were greeted by the chef who sat us because the servers were a little busy.  An entire wall of the restaurant looks out to the runway and where they park the planes - so cool!  We watched a larger private plane come in, park, a black SUV pulls up, there are all of a sudden 5 guys running around with luggage, etc.  It was like a scene out of a movie!  (a man on crutches and a woman and possibly a sleeping child but too far away to see who it was) Anyway...The servers are attentive to each table and don't just throw the food down and dash.  There is a little friendly conversation and banter between the servers and the tables.  This makes for an experience you won't forget but it also means you might wait an extra minute for your bill, or whatever.

I had the chicken chopped salad and my hubby had a chicken wrap.  The food portions were perfect and the food itself was very tasty!  We also ordered the chips.  How can you go wrong with homemade potato chips with blue cheese crumbles and bacon and some delicious aioli on the bottom.  WOW!
Overall, we had a nice lunch and we will be back!"
dc6sPg9kNliz_Cy2yX19tw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"I'm a fan.  The atmosphere is a little cold, but the staff makes you feel welcome.  The food is not the greatest (sometimes the goza (sp?) is cold) but it's consistent and flavorful.  Rob behind the bar may seem very busy but he makes time to leave the nicest notes on your receipts - ""It was great to see you.  Have a wonderful evening."" etc...

They have a great happy hour too - it allows you to try a variety of sushi at 1/2 price.  Def try the Godzilla tails.  Too much fun!"
-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"So being a creature of habit, I usually have 1 or 2 dishes at fav restaurants that I order every time.  This is the first restaurant where I have found over 10 items on the menu I'd like to try.  We've been there 3 or 4 times now and I've tried something different every time (go me!).

*  The veggie burger had quite a bit of flavor and was well worth giving up the beef for the night.
*  The mac and cheese is pretty good, sometimes cold, but that doesnt' stop me from ordering it each time we eat there.
*  The turkey and brie gallette was also good,  but gets a little rich towards the end.
*  The jalisco sandwich is a fav!  A little messy but soooo worth it!
*  Just recently I tried a bite of the baked lobster and crab puffs - will be ordering that one again!
*  The bruschetta - there are two different kinds on the plate.  The first time we ordered this there was waaaay too much balsamic on the ""caprese"" but the ham & artichoke spread bruschetta was absolutely to die for, melt in your mouth, must have every time you go there good.  The second time we tried the bruschetta, both flavors were very good.

I've had bites of other things on the menu as well and I have no complaints.  The menu is extremely eclectic and it's worth multiple trips."
CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"Took my dad here when he was in town.  He is a traditional Japanese eater so no bistros or fancy sushi for him!  We don't live close to this neighborhood at all but we were in the hood and asked around about a Japanese restaurant close by.  Hana was recommended to us as a good but a little on the pricey side place to eat.  They were correct.

It was almost hard to find a spot to park.  The restaurant is very tiny and it was very packed.  They told us 20 minutes for a table, but we only waited about 5.  The hostess was very nice and polite.  The service was quick and to my dad's excitement, our server was Asian.  (he has this weird thing about not eating at an Asian restaurant unless some of the servers/chefs are Asian - says it's a sign of ""Americanization of the food"").  The ambiance was welcoming but yet had that urban feel to it.  All the employees seemed extremely nice and polite and there were some large parties waiting for tables for over 40 minutes.  There's something to be said about the restaurant if these people were willing to wait that long with children.

We ordered the usual stuff, edamame, soup, salad, sushi, etc.  The edamame came out cold - never had cold before.  When my dad asked them if we could get hot ones they nuked the ones we had, making them a little soggy.  All the food was good, not exceptional.  The reason for 3 stars is it's quite pricey for the quality and for what we had.  We have a Japanese restaurant in our hood that serves the same quality food for less.  Of course, there are no Asian people working there so Dad's out...  Overall, if I was in the area again, I might stop by to try some other items on the menu but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop again.  If you are in the area, it's definitely worth a try."
k-NEUIXaPnXtrzCo1MeO7g,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,3,"I was excited to see a sub place that delivered in the area.  We now have another option rather than pizza or chinese food.  And they deliver until 10pm!  They can be fast on delivery, if they know where they are going.   I have waited up to almost an hour before, and we are literally kiddy-corner from the store.  The sandwiches are good and filling but I don't get the hype.  The tuna salad is ok, a little it on the onion-y side.  They don't have but 2 bread options - an 8"" white roll or regular thick cut multi-grain bread.  We do order from here about once a week solely based on the convenience of delivery.  Worth a try."
-yWvniZVC6TjhnnptXRVrA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Great food, great service. The best part is the fact that you can get half a sandwich and a cup of soup or side salad. The tuna salad sandwich has the perfect blend of flavor without too much mayo. You can get the breakfast burrito all day, to the happiness of my husband. I've had that too and it is wonderful. Never had a bad meal here.

Bonus: The green tea ice tea is amazing!"
6ON9B6DsL5cUnPmIy8A06w,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,2,"We were excited to move into the neighborhood and find a bar and grill so close to our house!  That was short-lived.  They have an outdoor patio, but no service.  Let me rephrase with the longest run-on sentence ever:  They start out serving you and then disappear so you end up standing in the middle of the dining room with empty baskets of food and empty cocktails while 10 servers and 2 bartenders are running around you completely ignoring you until a patron at the bar offers to move over a bit so you can put stuff down and then you proceed to stand there waiting for more cocktails when the bartender comes over, looks at the empty baskets with a perplexed look on her face but still doesn't look up to take my order or even ask if I'd like anything and now it's been 20 minutes (not kidding) of standing in the bar being ignored.

Taking a breath...

The patio doesn't have misters or heaters either.  My hubby is a smoker so we always seek out comfortable smoking patios.  Boooooo on this one.  We have been to the Zipp's at 16th and Bethany and their patio is awesome, except for the picnic tables.

The drinks were short, not much booze unless you are a regular there apparently but the food is consistent and fairly good for bar food.  Love the chicken skewers."
tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,2,"You hear quite often how people just LOVE this place.  I thought it was a regular Chinese restaurant on steroids.  We had a gift certificate so we took our friend there for his birthday.  The service was OK until we were done with our meals.  The empty, dirty plates sat on our table for a good 10 minutes while our server cleaned the tables around us.  I would be a little more understanding if it weren't close to closing time and those other dirty tables needed to be cleaned in order to be sat again, but it was about 30 minutes from close and 3/4 of the restaurant was empty.

The food was ok.  Nee House is so much better though, without the hype.  Unless we have a gift certificate we wouldn't seek this place out."
BvTU8s3v-qfTtsSKV6Y16A,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"We have been to this place multiple times and the food is great every time. I have noticed they have changed the menu over the years, but the changes have all been really good! My favs are the bbq pork quesadilla and the ahi tuna salad. Portions are very large so feel free to share. Their brunch is also good. I prefer more of a traditional breakfast, but the entrees they have are just as good. Love sitting at the bar and the service is always great."
TQ-FgDYJbJhIXTvSdv-jUw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"This restaurant location has been a gazillion different names over the years. I'm not a fan of BBQ but it sure smells good the minute you walk in the door. They have done quite a bit to spruce this place up into a sports bar. There are TVs everywhere (VERY nice TVs), except on the patio. The bartender, Jen, was super nice and friendly and gave us GREAT service. The patio is an odd-shape but they have done wonders decorating it. There is shade and a misting system. The couple regulars sitting at the bar were friendly as well. The place is clean and comfy. They have live music on the weekends as well as the UFC fights and football. The prices were reasonable as well with many items on the menu a non-bbq girl would like."
-LVpf-mKjrWT51JgCY3gRQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"I know, I know...it's a chain.  But it's in the hood and it's GOOD!!  We have been there a handful of times and mostly like everything we have ordered.  I love that you can choose 1/2 and 1/2; meaning 1/2 salad, cup soup, 1/2 spud, 1/2 sandwich and use ANY combination.  That means you can try 2 different salads, 2 different sandwiches, salad & sandwich, salad & spud, etc.  Here's what I've had so far:

Savannah Chopped Salad:  Mmmmm... gorgonzola cheez....The ingredients were fresh but I would recommend changing the dressing to ranch.  Not a fan of the sherry shallot.
The Smokey Pepper jack Turkey grilled Sandwich:  Melts in your mouth!  There is a little tang but lots of flavor.  You can taste the bacon in every bite.
Spicy Southwest Chicken Griller:  The Chipotle Ranch is a little sassy!  Love it! I'm usually not a fan of ""warm"" guacamole (it comes on this sandwich and the sandwich is grilled) but it tasted fine and added that necessary ""moisture"", for lack of a better term, to the sandwich.
Cobb Club:  MY FAV!!!  It states on their online menu that they add mayo but I'm pretty sure the one here uses Light Mayo, which I love!  The gorgonzola (mmmmmmm.....) makes this sandwich pop in your mouth.  It's a perfect combo of all these ingredients without being too much.
Mac & Cheez:  You can get this as a side.  I have a rule to try the mac & cheez wherever I go.  This one was creamy enough but had a weird, industrial, mass-produced taste to it.  Not nearly as bad as some I've had.  Would I order it again?  Maybe...
Bacon/Cheez Spud:  Holy crap these things are huge!  I didn't know potatoes could grow that large.  It took three meals to finish it, as a side dish of course, but so worth it.
There are still more items I'd like to try.  They have special takeout parking so it's easy to get in and out.  Happy eating all!"
ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Great restaurant/lounge on 7th street. I've only had apps there as the food is not my fav (my taste buds only). Crystal, the new bartender, is AWESOME! She is right on top of drinks, food, everything! I'm sure the other bartenders are great as well, just haven't had a chance to meet them yet. When we were there the staff was setting up for a very large birthday party that was supposed to be outside on the smoking patio. Then it started raining. Instead of displacing those of us in the bar, they were able to accommodate current customers and the large party in the dining room. The owner was right in the middle of the mix helping to move things around and get set up rather than barking orders. He seemed to create more of a family feel with the staff and customers, thus making everyone feel comfortable.

We ordered the quesadilla and the calamari. The onion-ring-looking calamari has this very light breading that was just perfect. The quesadilla was huge and filled us up quickly. There is a red salsa-tasting sauce that comes with the calamari that was very good. The other sauce (not sure what it was) didn't compliment the calamari very well. Crystal suggested the chipoltle crema sauce, which went with both the calamari and the quesadilla. I have had the chips and salsa before and that's definitely worth trying as well. All the apps are 1/2 off during happy hour.

It's under new ownership so if you haven't been there for a while, check it out again.  I also heard a rumor they are opening for lunch starting next week.  Curious to see that menu."
F-PmkzyN80fVcNMN8Z2aiw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Never used to be a fan of this place...apparently they've changed their menu in the past few years, or my taste buds have matured past grilled cheese and pbj, which is a high possibility.  My hubby and I stopped by for lunch/brunch once and again a few weeks later for a late lunch.  I honestly can't remember what we ate for brunch/lunch but I know it was good (quite a bit of food though - recommend sharing if you can or doggie bag it).  The staff is all very friendly and welcoming as well.

For the late lunch we split the chile pork verde.  It was very very good (in love with Renegade's green chili pork stew though.)  We also split Leo's Street Tacos.  Both of these were very filling and absolutely amazing.  The salsa/sauce that accompanied these dishes had so much flavor - in fact all the ingredients had flavor.  These two dishes combined with the corn bread...too much good stuff!  There were more items we would like to try so we will def be back.

For dessert, we found out the apps were 1/2 price due to happy hour.  What a sweet treat."
9d3xGYst3o4KhDwhF2dFMg,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Semi-fast food, I guess is how you would describe it.  We were pleasantly surprised at how non-greasy the burgers were.  They had a great char flavor to them.  I can't wait to try the tri-tip sandwich or the tuna sandwich, both of which I heard were very good.

If you get a meal deal, keep in mind they come with A LOT of fries.  The fries are very good, just too many of them.  The staff is young but seem to learn quickly and are extremely friendly!  We will def be back.

ps - They are open until 10pm!"

We stopped in for a few appetizers in the late afternoon.  Maybe 2 tables, 3 people sitting at the bar...not busy.  Oh, but the entire staff (about 6 or 7) was at the end of the bar talking the ENTIRE time we were there.   We sat at the bar because we were on a bit of a time crunch.

Acknowledgment......acknowledgement....ackNOledgment....a c k  n  o   w   l    e    dgmennnnnnnnnnnnnntttttttttt...And we've got it!  Bummer...just wiped down the bar in front of us.  Didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink, menu, nothin'.  About five minutes go by, I raise my hand like a little school girl.  ""Could we get some water please"".  Another five minutes go by...I REALLY don't want to interrupt the popular kids from their recess chat but for the love of god puck drops in 55 min!  I raise my hand like a little school girl again.  ""Could we order some apps?"".  Another 5 minutes goes by.  Now I'm frustrated because the popular kids at recess are still ignoring me!  I raise my hand again.  ""Could we order some beers?"".  Word to the wise servers at Bonefish, NEVER judge a book by it's cover.  Just because we weren't dressed up doesn't mean we aren't good tippers or even the sausage kings of Chicago.  Plus, you do know you are working at a chain restaurant....no need to be snooty or snotty.

Food came out fairly quickly.  It was quite good.  I would recommend the Bang Bang shrimp with a side of the sweet chili sauce that comes with the mac & cheese bites.  The mac & cheese bites were kind of blah until you added the chili sauce. There were quite a few things on the menu that I'd like to try.  Their bowl looked good as did their chicken, of all things.  I'm not much of a fish eater but some of the meals look pleasing.

Wasn't until we were almost done when the bartender (one of 2, by the way) came by and asked how everything was.  I was quite excited that I didn't have to raise my hand again to ask for more water.  Oh wait, my husband did...He filled my glass but not the one sitting 6"" away.  Final hand raise - the check.  Not once did he ask if we wanted another beer.  Way to upsell buddy!

The final straw to this poor, poor service was what was overheard said by one of the bartenders.  This is not a direct quote, but you get the gist:  ""We need more experienced bartenders here.  But where are we going to get them?  Chili's?  Outback?  Olive Garden?  Those are just pretend bartenders.  They don't know what they are doing.""  As my friend Johnny said:  Dude, when I think ""mixologist"" I'm definitely not thinking of a bartender at Bonefish.  And given the HORRENDOUS service we received, and the fact that I actually know some of the bartenders at those locations, it might be beneficial to Bonefish to actually hire those bartenders because they have more experience in their little finger than the current bartenders and could bring people in because they know people in the hood.  Plus they are friendly, attentive, non-judgmental and actually know how to make a drink.  Gosh, I even hired one of them to bartend for me.  Best hire in a while.

We MIGHT be back in a few months.  Maybe then they might have their stuff together."
5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"I would love to give this restaurant 4.5 stars, if possible.  The food is home made and good, but you will have to wait a few extra minutes so don't come starving.  The service is spotty, sometimes.  The prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are large.  I love that they have the lighter fare menu as it is so hard to find a decent breakfast under 2,000 carbs and 50,000 calories.  ;-)  The breakfast burrito is huge and tasty; the pancakes are light and fluffy but soooo flavorful!  Haven't had a bad meal there."
3rWRNL9sFX4YiWPqaUvUzw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"When HRC was on Camelback, we frequented the bar for happy hour.  During that time, we befriended the bartenders, who are still there  They create a neighborhood feel to this international chain.  Phoenix HRC is different than the other ones I've been to because of this.  When they moved downtown we continued to frequent the bar.  Number 1 reason to drive downtown for happy hour - the bartenders Javier and Eddie.  They have incredible memories and pick up the conversation you ended with the last time you were there, and that could have been 8 months ago.  They are quick with the drinks and with their wit.

The food is ok and over-priced, but that comes with the HRC name.  We have found the entire staff to be friendly and accommodating.  A neighborhood HRC bar...hmmmm.  Sure feels like it."
n8fGqb4CCheGyWtr9KM6qw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Wow!  Who knew a little Italian restaurant at 40th St and Thunderbird in a strip mall would be this good.  Not just good...phenom!  It's mostly northern Italian food.  The portions are the perfect size, which allows you to try an app, meal and dessert.  We started out with the eggplant app.  My hubby doesn't like eggplant but gobbled this up!  The sauces are a little on the sweet side but still excellent.  The wine selection was good and the service was good.  I love that they serve the house wine by the glass, 1/2 carafe or full carafe.  The house wine was actually quite good.  Definitely need to check this place out. We will be back for sure."
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Wish we lived a little closer...Really like this place.  Because of the design of the building you can't hear all the traffic out on Camelback, which just adds to the ambiance.  I think it's really neat their herb garden is on premise as well.  My fav is the grilled veggie sandwich with the pesto spread.  This is also a great place to lunch with a friend and split one of their pizzas and a salad.  The service is good too.  It's a little loud and some of their items are a little pricey, but the food always tastes fresh.  Way cool that they kept the old barber chairs and pictures of the building back in the day.  Definitely need to check this place out!"
Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,5,"Incredible service from the hostess to the kitchen. Only downfall is they are really busy all the time. Good for them, not the greatest when you are starving. Of course I guess that would be my own fault.

We went there with some friends to check it out.  We ended up ordering a butload of food to split.  Here goes:

There was a chef's special bruschetta - can't remember what's on it but it was REALLY good!

Big Artichoke:  This is not something I would order as my hubby wouldn't normally eat this and I would end up eating the whole thing.  However, this time he tried it and loved it!  It was large and had quite a bit of ""meat"" on it.

Patty Jane:  Perfect to split between the four of us.  Specifically because of all the other food we ordered.  The pears were poached perfectly and the dressing complimented the salad very well.

Manifesto Pizza:  My hubby and I ordered this, without the fennel as we are not fans.  It's Schreiner's sausage.  How can you go wrong!

Casanova Pizza:  Our friends ordered this one.  As I said earlier, we all shared everything.  This is not a pizza I would have EVER ordered.  Holy crap was it good!!!  (we ordered no dates as we are not fans)  The ricotta and pecorino cheeses melted in my mouth.  Yummmmmm!!!

Lamb Bolognese:  I said I was hungry.... My hubby actually ordered this because he said he wasn't in the mood for pizza (he was wrong, ate both).  It was a little rich for me, but lamb can be rich after a while.  The sauce was amazing.

For the record, we did have quite a bit of left-overs taken home.  We all enjoyed the dinner very much and will be back.  By the way, if you can, ask for Jill.  She is an amazing server!  Just the best!"
-3oxnPPPU3YoxO9M1I2idg,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,3,"We were the only two people in the restaurant when we ordered. The girl who made our pizzas got one of them wrong which wasn't realized until it was brought to our table because the wrong item was added after being baked. Rather than complain, we ate our meal. The manager came by a short while later and asked how everything was. We informed him of the error and he did offer to make a new pizza. We declined as half of the wrong one was already eaten. He was apologetic and very friendly. I appreciate his offer to correct the other employees mistake but seriously...she had one job and we were the only two customers!! That's only a 50% success rate! I'd hate to see what happens when they're actually busy. The quality of food itself was good; no complaints there but I just don't see is frequenting this place after our first impression."
HwEDsb1xtRBTuFwATTRjpA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,2,Absolutely terrible customer service!!! Both over the phone and in person!! I waited on hold twice to place a to go order. The first time I was disconnected after a couple of minutes the second time I gave up and hung up as I was almost to the restaurant anyways!! Walked in the was rudely directed to the bakery. Waited there to place my order. Was given the wrong order and had to ask for it to be corrected which it was. The cheesecake is always good but I will drive further to a different location for better customer service any day!!
I-VD-o4JDGSG5GHQ2EbrVA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,2,"Their burgers and chicken sandwiches were good but nothing great. Their smash fries weren't very good. Very salty and very thin and short making eating them difficult. But my biggest problem is the rude staff! Cashiers who ignore you when you're asking them a question. And not just ignore you but have a conversation with the cashier next to them while you're mid-question. Also, the girls telling you they're coming right back to wipe down your dirty table and never coming back. It wasn't even busy lunch rush hour yet every table was dirty. We won't be going back."
09psTuUYhUMA2ZRzQlm30Q,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,4,We've always had friendly service here and our order is always correct. The burgers always taste great. The portion size of their fries is huge but the quality isn't great. They're usually on the soggy and warm side instead of hot and crispy. If the fries were continuously good I'd have given 5 stars.
LKOo9nZKMI6WPzSa7wMvOg,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,1,"Before Paradise turned into Panera, we always had terrible service at this location and inaccurate orders. We gave Panera a try hoping they would be different...but it's the same problems! We went in for dinner and there was one couple ahead of us ordering cookies. There was one employee helping them out and I counted 3 others mindlessly walking around behind the counter without a word to us or the now 4 other groups behind us.  Eventually a 4th woman, I'll assume the manager based on how she was dressed compared to the others, rudely came out and said she'd help us. She had no enthusiasm, no apology for the 15 minutes we'd already waited, and had zero friendliness...not even a smile. We placed our order and took a seat in the next-to-empty dining area. When our order came out it was all wrong. We mentioned it to the girl and she giggled like she was embarrassed and did nothing to offer to correct it. So there we sat and ate our inaccurate order not wanting to deal again with the rude manager and risk getting our food spit in or messed with some other way. The food itself was ok...the salad was mostly hard iceberg hearts. Needless to say, we will never be going back here."
MM8n7SPaIuMlDGbUM5SZhA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,3,"We were so excited to check out this theater!! Comfy seats, dinner, and a movie?! Sounds great! It was ok. Movie was great! Seats were more comfy than typical theater seats but were made of some material that you kind of stick to...which in hot Arizona weather isn't so nice. Service was ok, our server was on the rude side and acted as if we were an inconvenience to him. Food was ok, about what you'd expect from a theater. I would give it another try but I'd go for the upgraded cinema seating next time."
Ws8V970-mQt2X9CwCuT5zw,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,4,Obviously a huge assortment of teas! I had the Banana Jack and it was pretty good.  The food was great and the dessert was amazing!  The location was nice and although they seemed short staffed the one girl was fairly quick. I will definitely be going back.
nsNONDHbV7Vudqh21uicqw,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,1,"This restaurant has so much potential! Maybe we just had a bad server but my experience here left no desire to ever return. When a customer orders their food a particular way, you don't then serve it completely different with the excuse of I think you'll like it better my way. Because of this server...the best part of my meal was the steamed baby carrots...and I paid much more than I should have to enjoy baby carrots."
h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,2,We came here because the movie we wanted to see was in 2D here and at our fave AMC it was 3D. The customer service was ok; the website was not allowing me to order my tickets in advance so I called and was told there wasn't anything that could be done on their end. We arrived and purchased our tickets at the box office an hour early and had a drink at the bar until our theater was open. The bartender was nice but MIA when it came time to close our tab. The theater itself seemed outdated and we weren't told at the box office our seats were actually only computer desk chairs at a counter. Seriously...we paid to sit in a computer desk chair. They allowed us to switch our seats to another row but that meant we had to split up our group. Had we been told about the seating situation prior we probably would've been able to get us all together considering we purchased the tickets an hour early. The food was ok. The appetizers were by far better than the dinner options. Guess it's hard to mess up pretzel bites. All in all I think we'll stick with AMC for our future dinner/movie theaters.
QK9Sy16uWUqEwTPdoKSiEA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,3,"Food tasted good, service was slow. The worst thing was this: we were seated in a booth with a straight shot view into the kitchen. I saw a server rub her nose with her bare hand and then pick up a thing of butter and plates of food and served them! There were also several employees eating in the same area!"
VtgFuz3LXsrGB-SzPSQbDg,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,3,"No indoor seating but there was shade, misters, and an outdoor AC unit. The food was not bad but who doesn't have any type of chicken on a BBQ menu? The owner came out and asked how things was and we asked why he didn't have chicken and be straight up said he never would. You'd think he'd be more open to listening to his customers about what they want...after all, it's the customers who keep him in business. There was a lot of fat on the meat and the burritos were filled with ""mush"" rather than shredded beef. The mango salsa was good and the bean quesadilla was good too."
BWsCjBVMR289vtojIz-gWw,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,1,Tonight we saw an employee laying in the dirt next to the restaurant smoking. He then got up and dusted the dirt off and went back inside! Now I know we won't be eating here. It is absolutely disgusting and anyone near food should not be laying in dirt on the job!
4byJn6eBAZmkPO8A8Vtxlw,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,2,The order taker was friendly and entered the correct order. There was only a couple people ahead of us. The actual cashier experience was terrible. She was the only cashier/drink maker/drink server working and the customers in front of her had to stand and wait 10+ minutes to just pay for their food!! Management is terrible if they think Sunday brunch time can be efficiently done with such little staff!! I typically love Einstein's but after this visit I don't have any urge to rush back in!
EVbEdWYLE9GDpVG97MGw-w,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,4,We were sat quickly and in a booth. Our drink order was taken almost immediately. Took a while to place our food order. The chips and salsa weren't great. Overly greasy chips and the salsa was more of a from-the-jar and not homemade. Our food was good. Huge portions so we had plenty to take home. It took a long time to get drink refills...but I think our server was new as he seemed way overwhelmed. I'd return if I were in the area again.
HLaSleAoR2PMF7s5ogqYqA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,3,The food is about what your expect from a typical diner/restaurant. The pies are good but not the best. Service has been good but slow. The servers always seem to have too large of sections to take care of efficiently. The front end staff seems to vanish when needed. A server finally seated us when there wasn't a host in sight. Then when it was time to pay there wasn't anyone at the cash register. Because we are honest people we waited around for her to show up so we could pay. Has a nice quiet atmosphere which is good.
Qa28KVKttuch8opQfVRUAQ,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,5,"We ran into this place by accident and decided to treat ourselves to a sweet treat after dinner. The shop was very clean and had a really nice, relaxing atmosphere. We were greeted by Madison (I hope I remembered her name correctly!) and made to feel welcomed. We asked about a couple drinks and ended up learning that they're actually a non-profit who help women and their children who've suffered from domestic abuse. I think this is an amazing place and a much needed place! Our drinks were delish and the price was way less than expected! We were invited to come back for one of their many nightly events. This place is a little out of the way for us but it's well worth the drive knowing what their mission is."
sJNcipFYElitBrtiJx0ezQ,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,2,We phoned ahead to put our name on the wait list. When we arrived on time we were told we'd be seated next within 10 minutes. 40 minutes later we finally were seated. Service took forever and everyone seemed to be in a bad mood. The sever even rolled her eyes when my husband asked her a question about their fries vs chips. She never offered any drinks to the couple of us who weren't drinking beer (designated drivers) and only brought water.  My food was so so. The chicken in my chicken sandwich was very dry. The guys loved their food but they were also drinking so I'm sure it tasted much better than it actually was. I love the idea of keeping things local but this just isn't worth the price tag or the waiting.
kG_EB5RAsSA3f9HJikI1rw,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,4,"The place was super packed inside (and uncomfortably hot considering it's not summer time) so we opted to dine outside. We asked the hostess to turn on one of the heat lamps, she looked at it and said she didn't feel any heat from it so we asked again to please turn it on again thinking maybe she misunderstood us. She fiddled with the knob and then left. She never actually turned it on. Our server took our order promptly and brought us our drinks quickly. The loaded fries were less than impressive. It was like fries sitting on melted velveeta cheese with sour cream drizzled on top. Not worth their price in my opinion. Our burgers tasted great. Can't complain about that at all! However 3 pickle chips as a side is a little weird considering the high price of the burger. I'd expect fries or a salad to be included with the price of the burger. All in all, 4 stars for the taste of the burger and for our server who was friendly and quick but this isn't a place we'll be frequenting because it's too expensive for what you get."
nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,3,Service has been great both times that we've dined. I wish their salsas were more authentic and not so sweet! Their green sauce was sweet like candy and even their red sauce was too sweet. I know some salsas are made to be sweet but that should be an option...I expect a spicy salsa delivered with chips! The food was pretty good but I would've loved it even more if I could've smothered it in some authentic salsa! Atmosphere is good but the booth seats are in pretty bad shape. Overall this wouldn't be a first choice or even a second choice of Mexican food for me.
-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,5,I love this place. Everything I've tried has been really good and decently priced. I love the atmosphere as well. Although I prefer the outdoor dining area more because the music is really loud indoors and difficult to have a conversation.
FlDrZAqMcDVtbxJ19M6EQg,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,4,"It's hard for me to give this place 4 stars because of the cashier but other than her everything was great! The cashier barely spoke at all, didn't answer our questions with actual words...more like head nods and noises. She didn't repeat our order to us which of course ended up being wrong but we didn't know until we actually got our burgers. Other than her, we've always had a good experience here and the food has always been good!"
Sg_qo-g8nWyADZSYUxh_rA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,5,"We've been to this location multiple times and always leave satisfied. Management there is always great as are all the employees. Super friendly, helpful and patient! The food is also always good. Actually, everything I've had here leaves me satisfied. This is definitely one of our favorite places to eat!"
r3pcA3Ux25v6RhbeoZWHRA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,2,This was our first time dining here and neither of us were impressed. My skillet was very bland and the turkey sausage had lots of cartilage in it. Gross. We won't be eating here again. Wish it was better since they're a local business and I like to support locally owned business but just can't do it.
eEfDS8JjpUOoslhJDIbltA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,5,"We've had pizza from this location twice (dine in and take out) and each time it has been great! Huge slices, everything is always fresh, and the crust is perfect. They are by far better than most places that sell pizza by the slice."
cOZLg1c-UcB2Yj3baQDKkA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,4,The food was pretty good but not the best I've had. One thing that I hated was the very loud music playing that made it sounds like I was in a club rather than a steakhouse. I wouldn't mind the music in the bar and the patio but definitely not in the dining room! Service was great; very long wait tho. Overall I don't think I'll be a regular at The Keg but maybe occasionally.
qiKUvyHkDNmmJkzo-BIaIA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,5,We had excellent service for our large party. There was always new chips and salsa when we ran out and drinks we refilled before we even ran out! Rarely does that happen anywhere. The food was pretty good and all of our orders were correct. We even had a birthday in our group and they sang and brought our table an order of dessert. I would definitely go back to Mi Amigo's.
frCxZS7lPhEnQRJ3UY6m7A,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"Strawberry salsa?? I've never heard of such a thing....but damn it's good! It's like chips and salsa...for desert! Fish tacos were on point, flavorful and plentiful. Topped it off with a premium margarita and I tell you what, that was the best meal I ever had! Now, for a place that has such good food, they got no where to sit. There is like 4 tables here and the bar, so try and go here during a not-so-popular time during the day to eat. Being able to sit back and enjoy all the food here is well worth it. The art on the walls are cool too."
xZhNZb01n9b4e2X7bZdoVQ,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,This is the best Mexican food you will ever have in Phoenix! Fresh ingredients that you can definitely taste!! A side guacamole with the chips is highly recommended and do take advantage of the great bartenders there; the drinks were perfect.
vCcnawY4Q41A1rlnxKBzkA,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"Chandler lucks out with another great burrito place! Burritos are made right in front of you, and you can put whatever you want on them! When I go for lunch, the cooks always seem to be in a great mood and are not afraid to joke around for the short time I'm in the restaurant, it's great."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"Best store/bar/restaurant/brewery/open-establishment I have ever been too. I've eaten or drank some beer here hundreds of times and it never gets old. The food is ALWAYS good, the beer is ALWAYS cold and the atmosphere is always live. Couldn't make a better place to be all day even if I tried."
9AI96ikMEJv7e0WIfz0mjw,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"THE BEST CHEESESTEAK SANDWICH I EVER HAD! I can't believe how good they are, it has changed my life. After eating one of these sandwiches, the rest of my life seems so dull....colors aren't as vivid....smells not as fragrant....these sandwiches push all your senses to the edge. I don't think I could eat another sandwich in my life, now knowing it is not as good as it can be. Please...be careful when eating here...you may never want to eat anything else afterward."
acD0l-j5Kr-edoO-_tcbyg,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,4,"Whoa. Lulu's Sweet And Spicy Tabasco Glazed Wings are the best wings I have ever eaten. They are crispy, delicious and best of all, hot! Small beer selection on tap, but it just so happens that the beers they do have (Four Peak's Kiltlifter and San Tan's Devil's Ale to name a few) are my favorites! Soon I'll try more things on the menu, but the wings are a great reason to keep coming back!"
vrFWQ7CDULCP87oTNC5sxA,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,4,"I've always preferred a thick Chicago-style pizza to a thin New York-style any day. With the lunch special that they have even on the weekends, it makes me want to hit up Barro's everyday. San Tan brew on tap and I'm set for lunch."
DcfkRb2bS2c8z21WH-aS6A,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"When I crave homemade Mexican food but I'm at work far from home, this place is just as good! The people working there are really nice, work hard and make great food! THIS IS NOT A HOLE IN THE WALL, the place is very clean and the great service I get surprises me every time."
DvY_J2gFxudK9HC8kjI3NA,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,3,"Meh...


That's all I really thought while I ate my chicken fajita sandwich.

It wasn't bad by any means...

For a $13 lunch, I wasn't impressed.

I liked the inside of the place, it looked fun to be in. There is a large selection of things to get but it's just one of those places that feel like I got kinda ripped off. I could go to Sacks down the street and get an amazing chicken fajita sandwich for a couple bucks less.

I like to give places the benefit of the doubt and maybe what I got was not there best, so I shall return in the future and hit up the other grill that has burgers.

Extra star for the dude walking around with a bowl of candy. That was cool."
PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,4,"The food is great! Everything on the menu looked really good, it was hard to decide what to eat the first time there. I like a place that I can just walk into, pick something random and it comes out way better then I expected. So I'm not going to recommend eating anything specific, just recomend that you try this place out."
1C7mPT-9mFihyZq8-qLxgw,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,4,"I love the teriyaki chicken bowl, so good. The people running this place are really friendly but at the same time are moving very quickly and do not sit around and chit-chat. They get you the food as fast as they can and they make sure it's how you want it then it's on to the next person. Couldn't ask for much more to be honest. Also I like this place because it's dark and relaxing inside, nice place to hide on a bright sunny day."
7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"I love stopping by this place, even if I get just one thing. The brûlée burger is my drug of choice here, it's so damn good. The bacon and onion with burnt sugar really adds a great and unique flavor to the burger, definitely my favorite part."
ZdGWAv90dY81kpKzMLMvvA,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,3,"Great place for beers and wings! I always came here if I wanted a dark, chill place to sit back, drink some beers and watch an ASU football game. They got a lot of tables right in front of a wall of TV screens, so it's bound to have the game you want to watch on. I don't think I've ever had anything other then wings and beer here so I can't say much more about it, but if a big game is on and all the hot-spots are filled up, come on over to Pranksters."
hTe5SavBjp3zRulupZSJew,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,4,"Good pizza, lot's of seating space. Our lunch took forever to make and there really wasn't many people there at all. I go to the Chandler location quite often and they are fast and really nice there. I didn't get the same service here but oh well, at least the food was just as good,"
vGDhK2Lc4Np5iZYZ7FG0QA,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,We were craving some good Mexican food and decided to try out a relatively new spot over by the Dutch Bros near 12th and Glendale. This was a great place with cold Dos XX on tap and good tortas! I gotta go back here again soon!
hIgGkG1JnHX4xmVuOgegDw,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,3,"Woah, some good phillys up in here! Pretty simple menu, big sandwiches and a bunch of toppings that are available this side of the counter. I got just a regular steak philly with peppers and onions, it was gone within seconds. French frys are really good too and with the fry sauce they got, makes it even better. Every once in a while I'm in this area so next time I'm around, I'm stopping here."

First of all there was a long wait for a table, which I don't mind at all for good food, but there wasn't any. The burrito I had was very ""meh"" and could be purchased at any Mexican themed restaurant, Applebee's or 7-11. But what is the food without the atmosphere?? Well there was an MMA fight on the TVs so a bunch of idiots were watching other idiots beating each other up for money. Wasn't exactly the best place to talk to friends but if I wanted to fight someone, this would be the first place I would go to. Why? Trying to get service there was impossible and by the time someone came to take our order, they were acting like we were an inconvenience for them, I guess they wanted to watch the fight instead of make money because I was down to do some drinking that night but after how long it took for one drink and a  mediocre burrito, I took off.

One star for Fayuca jamming out on the patio, that was cool."

The whole place is green inside so on St. Patty's day having everyone dressed in green as well was a bit intense. I got french toast and bacon, and that's exactly what I got. No goofy toppings or weird concoctions, just a picture perfect breakfast."

BBQ sandwiches aren't that big and to be honest if it wasn't for the great potato salad, I would think this place is a rip-off."

I like the choice of cocktails they have, I had a sample of the honey martini and the blueberry moonshine are both quite tasty.

We split a pizza and it was good, had lots of greens on it."

They have a lot of fun drinks to start things out, the fresh rolls are a great appetizer and all the main dishes I have were pretty good. I really liked the chow mein that they made, I know this isn't the type of place you would typically get chow mein but if you do, it's surprisingly good."

ghpFh6XpH1TYZhjAGdx-xw,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"It's like going to Chipotle or Subway but for pizza. With that said, it's hard to have a bad pizza because you get to choose what's on it, all at the same price. I like that because I like going mad wild on the toppings and not having to think about how much extra that's gunna cost me.

The pizza was pretty good quality wise, everything looked and tasted pretty good. Don't expect top notch gourmet pizzas here, something about the pizzas remind me of Pizza Hut to be honest. But for the price and convince of making a super good pizza for myself, I'll take it.

Didn't have to wait long at all for the pizza to cook, they aren't that big so they cook quick and definitely filling for lunch.

I will be back for more."

At first I thought this was going to be just like Chipotle by the way they have it all set up, but this food is 10x better then Chiptole! They were sold out of the bison meat so I got the pork ribs instead and if the pork ribs were this good, I can't imagine how good the bison is! If you've been by this place and wondered if it's any good, it's definitely worth going!"

The chorizo was very fresh and not too spicy , the tortilla was very fresh and delicious, and the hash browns were crispy but not over done. The staff was very friendly and checked in to make everything tasted great! I think I found my new favorite breakfast place!"

I once went for breakfast and the burrito I was given was just off the charts! Always fresh and delicious!

I would highly recommend los taquitos!"
DLcgZ180-gdPsHoU78xQDw,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,4,"Came in on father's day and only had to wait about 10 minutes which I thought was pretty great for being so busy. The wait staff was working really hard and was jumping from table to table getting orders and drinks. It was pretty understandable that they took our order quickly and didn't spend too much time at our table.

I ordered the chorizo omelette. It took about 20 minutes to get out to me. I think it could have come out a little faster since it was just lukewarm when it got to me. But it was still delicious! The eggs were fresh and the cheese was melty. I really like the potatoes it comes with as well. They know how to season a potato!

So I would give this place a solid 9/10! They also serve RC cola which is super rad! I will be back for sure!"
NCc227GObIORVxUXs-KWvw,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,5,"I really like this place! I have come here twice now. Once for lunch and once for the Sunday breakfast. I have never been disappointed or left hungry.

If you are coming for lunch I would suggest any of their freshly grilled burgers. They use a quality beef. But the magic is in the buns. I'm not sure if they are made in house but damn they are fresh. My bun was moist and soft. The fries are great too! They always come out fresh from the frier.

I really suggest trying the breakfast. It is not really that well known about and it is usually pretty quite around breakfast time. I got the chicken fried steak. This is probably the only place in Phoenix you can even get a chicken fried steak for under $10 and not be super disappointed after.

Great place and super friendly staff!"
_ikylomPLdTgVtE0xWR_1Q,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,5,"I've come to this place since I was little. It's literally part of my childhood. I feel like I grew up with the guy that works the window. He has been working there forever and is always super friendly! No matter if it's 3 am and I need Carne asada fried or its noon and I need a bean and cheese burrito for lunch. I don't know his name but he is always smiling and just happy to be there! It's such a joy to see him.

And don't even get me started on the food! 10/10! Five stars! Two thumbs up! I have never walked away disappointed or hungry. My favorites are Carne asada burrito, super breakfast burrito, California burrito, and the veggie burrito. No matter what I always get a side of chips and guacamole!

They will always hold a special place in my heart...and my stomach"
WXR0ND0KqbArMZDvFMA-bw,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,4,"I got the Buffalo Bill. It was a bison patty with bacon and Frank's red hot sauce. It was great! The burger was cooked perfectly! I mean, I don't know how bison is usually made but it tasted great so I'm assuming it was cooked well. It was spicy and savory! I strongly recommend it.

I also got some of the Parnassian truffle fries. They were really good but I wouldn't recommend eating a while order by yourself. They are full of flavor and it can be easy to go a little over board with them. But the regular fries were equally delicious! Very brown and very crispy just like I like them!

I thought I might as well try a shake while I'm here and boy am I glad I did! I got the pretzel and Nutella shake by recommendation of our server. She did not let me down at all! The shake was pretty thin and easy to drink and was topped off with pretzel chunks. Needless to say it was amazing!!!

Only gripe was that when I walked in I was really unsure of what to do. Took me a few minutes to figure out that I needed to order at the counter. But now I know :)"

I was immediately greeted at the door with a friendly smile. Then places at a table in a very nice room and coffee and drink were brought out quickly.

For brunch they had a prime rib eggs Benedict. Holy S***!!! It was amazing! The meat was so tender and cut like a firm cheese. The sauce was perfect and plentiful. The side of roasted potatoes were seasoned to perfection."

They called the manager, confirmed the order, and had all 50 sandwhiches ready in no time. Great customer service!"

They have this amazing deal with two slices and a drink for something like $5. It's amazing! The pizza comes out hot and fresh and the staff always comes and chats with us for a while too! A large group of teen boys is not welcome with such open arms to many places but pizza heaven will always be my pizza home
fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,5,This is a wonderful little grocery! I had a French dip sandwich and it was amazing! The bread was fresh and moist! The meat was super tender and filled with delicious flavors! After the sandwich I could not resist trying some of their crembrule and it was FANTASTIC!!! It was nice and creamy but not to sweet. And the staff was very courteous and friendly.

Besides all that, get ready to take a nose dive into some quality old fashioned cookin'. When you are first shown your table water will be waiting. You can take a load off your feet after a long day on the trail and kick that thirst. Then the waitstaff comes at you with a smile only made by the Lord above. You put your order in, look at that picture of a dead kid on the wall, and poof your food is right there before you.

You take your first bite and it's just like the dug up your momma, pulled some black magic, and put her back in the kitchen for one last meal before she goes back to line dancin' with jesus.

It's heavenly to say the least. Then out comes your basket of biscuits or corn bread. You know a cowboy opened this place because you can practically taste the cast iron skillet they were made on.

You could swing a cat at the menu and hit something delicious!"

I got a burrito and a lemonade. The lemonade was freshly made and tasted like a childhood summer day. The burrito was filled with pork, rice, cheese, cilantro, some pico, and of course topped with lava sauce.

The staff was just as laid back as I remembered! Always a great decision to go to the beach house."
-kIscN8I29eXMPkvyyxmRQ,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,4,"What a lovely place! The owner came out to my table and talked with my mom and I about our order. She talked about how those sandwiches came to be and about how this new location was working wonders.

The food is excellent! My sandwich had green Chile and macaroni on it (it was a special that day). And holy hand grenades it was amazing! So warm and toasty, spicy but not hot, and made with love.

I chose to have the side kale salad with my sandwich as well. I didn't think I liked kale but gosh d*rn it was really good! It had this tangy vinaigrette on it and came with mandarin slices. I give it an excellent out of 10!

I just wish the sandwhich was a little bigger. But other than that this place is great and I will be back soon!"

I went again maybe a month ago and something just doesn't feel right. The service is the same as always but the food has taken a turn. It's hard to put into words but I feel like eating here will lead to food poisoning.

Not sure if I can come back for the food :/"
es3Fq9KNp6Ry994x4T4ZYg,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,5,Crazy affordable and crazy delicious! I got the carne asada and if was crazy juicy and the tortilla was probably made within the last hour or so. So fresh!

I pretty much always get the Italian stallion. For two reasons: it's delicious and I get to yell Adrian with a mouth full of ice whenever the server brings it. I'm not sure if it a pity laugh or they are fans of Rocky. Either way, someone always laughs.

They also serve passion cookies (pazookies) which are half baked cookies with a scoop of ice cream to boot. It's a ballin' peice of culinary work. You need to get one when you go.

Seriously, give it a try and you'll be a huge fan in no time."

Other than that, fantastic restaurant and I love going there."

I would say it took the perfect amount of time to make it to my table. Not to quick that I know it was not fresh and not too slow that I had to figure out where my food was.

I'm pretty sure they don't make the rolls in house but I'm guessing they are made fresh daily. My bread was still moist when it got to me.

The steak was sooooo great too! It was cooked perfectly, made right, and chopped up into tiny bits. The fries were also made fresh!

The happy hour deals are something to write home about as well! Great place! I'll be back for sure!"

I strongly recommend getting the kali mist. It's amaze balls! They also have rice krisy treats made out of fruity pebbles. You need one of those.

The only thing I didn't like was how loud it was. I had to scream at the person who was taking my order for them to hear me. Also, they seemed a little stoned so that didn't help. Still a great place. You should check it out!"

For whatever reason the manager came over to check out my pick up order. So he walks over, looks me up and down, and gives me a very judgemental look. Then as I was paying he would not look me in the eye and used a very disgruntled tone. Did my business annoy you somehow? I literally was in the actual restaurant for 2 minutes and yet I walked away this bad.

Shame on Matt's. They are better than this. I will never be back. The food is overrated and the service is literally worse than what I would expect from a McDonald's."

I also recently tried the wing ding pizza. I'm not sure what a wing ding is but holy hell it's delicious! It's chicken and cheese with a buffalo like sauce. That's the best way I  can describe it. One of my favorite pizzas now.

And the service is always A+! It seems like it's mostly high school kids that work there but they are trained right and held to high standards. I have never had a bad experience here!"

VRTQMh7wVgmzg96YttL3mQ,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,2,"This is an extremely average restaurant. I got the Arizona burger(?) I think. It had guacamole, pickles, sour cream, and jalapeños. It was pretty much what I would expect from any chain burger place. Nothing super special. My meat was a little dry and not medium well at all. I got it on a pretzel bun which was pretty hecking awesome! Couldn't tell you if it was freshly made or not. Either way it was warm and really good.

I really don't like the chips they give you. They were fried fresh and that's for sure. But they had no seasoning on them. I couldn't find any salt on the table for them. I really would have preferred fries. The chips just don't go with the burgers at all.

But the kicker was the service. Carly was great. Dude with the bandaid on his face was horrible. He brought out my food and literally dropped it in front of me. Then walked away angrily. Like sorry for eating here I guess???

Also, do you really need every inch of wall covered in TVs that are all of the same chanel? Could we hang them higher than 6 feet off the ground? I hit my head on like 4 of them"
rbywwnfMjFjJwLQkgpdIEw,aTZrRPRWYDASTaKa_es9ew,4,"I love the atmosphere. Walking into an old house with bars on the windows just screams ""Mexican food made by angels"". The tacos are always killer with fresh meat and delicious cheese. The shells are always freshly fried and made to order.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the anxiety I get when I walk in. It's cramped, busy, and slightly warmer than it is outside. I have pretty bad anxiety so I have to be in the right mood to go here. But it is always worth it."

This is coming from the guy who plans cross-country road trips to get my lips on some of the food I see Triple-D.  Sorry Matt's, you kind of fell short on this one.  The wait was way too long for breakfast, although I guess the place is famous now so it's to be expected.

Inside, there were definitely more staff than diners, yet we seemed to be invisible.  We waited forever to get menus, drink and food orders, etc.  The staff were friendly enough and apologized once realizing how long we waited, but come on - it's breakfast, and there are all of what, 5 tables in the whole place?

The food was fantastic, no way to argue that.  Just a little over-priced for the experience that we didn't end up getting.

Would I go back again?  Yeah, if someone came cross-country on a Fieri food frenzy and demanded it.  Otherwise, I would stick to a little more down-to-earth kind of place, which I bet this once was."
e-Hw1QkvwM2wN5Wm7p_msw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"OK so its an Old Country Buffet.  That pretty much sums it up.  Never been to OCB?  How about Golden Corral?

The food comes from a food service and is heated back up... how else could they serve so much for so little?  You can get a pretty good bang for your buck here.  TIP - sign up for their emails, and you'll get some BOGO coupons.

We go here a few times a year when we feel like being fat and eating nasty food, its a guilty pleasure.  Really what we go for is the entertainment.  Trust me - you will be the skinniest person in sight.  There's always something fun to keep you entertained, last time there was a woman (mother?) who kept putting her hands up her (7ish year old?) daughter's shirt, and down her skirt.  Something was probably up.  The time before that, the hippo family (really just the mom and dad) kept burping as loud as they could throughout the meal.  It must have been a contest.

OK, food:  They usually have a guy at the grill cooking steaks.  Not bad steak for a buffet.  Pot roast is usually a safe bet, as is baked chicken.  They have all the usual canned, salty veggies as well as a lackluster taco bar, average salad bar, and enough desserts to keep the kids screaming.  Unfortunately they lack what every good buffet should have - good, fresh rolls/biscuits.  Don't bother.

Service: Pretty good, they come by pretty often to clear dirty plates and offer drink refills.  Overall the servers are probably a lot happier than they should be for working here, but just as well that way.

Should you eat here?  Of course!  Go on a night you feel like gorging/heading for a heart attack.  After a glance around the dining room you'll feel a lot better about your figure!"

St. Francis remains a favorite brunch spot (great live music starts at 10:30am Sundays), and performs just as well for dinner.  The service is always on par and the food is consistently delicious.  Go for their breakfast sandwich, sans mayo-sauce (come on, quit being fancy - no matter what you call it, may doesn't belong on a breakfast sandwich).  Their flat bread pizzas and burgers are always a good call at dinner time.  Did I mention happy hour?

My Veggie Panini was as delicious as described, and the coffee was just shy of perfect."

You want healthy?  You got it.
You want vegetarian/vegan?  You got it.
You want your food to taste amazing?  You got it.
Service?  You guessed it.

A spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid, but don't look over this menu item at Loving Hut.  I don't even remember what was in it, and frankly I don't care... it was simply amazing.

Start with a variety of the spring/summer/egg rolls and get a few different dishes, because you're going to want to try as many as possible.

Next time I will definitely start with dessert.  I could see how you'd always end up too full after dinner, but they look too amazing to miss."
HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"I would say Fuego Bistro's specialty is, well, everything.  Stand-up service, great lunch/happy hour selection and pricing, awesome patio setup, and some of the best Latin food I've eaten.  The waitstaff will definitely remember your name if you come back (and trust me, you will).  The mojitos are certainly delicious (blood orange for sure), but I would go for the sangria.  I like the red, but I hear the white is delicious as well, although a little sweet for me.  Pernil Asado is a sure pick, as is the dish with the mole should they put it on special again.  I'd eat and drink just about anything on the menu, and I'd be sure to leave full, drunk, and without a huge hold in my wallet!  Thanks, Fuego Bistro, I wish I found you sooner!

PS - they are on Restaurant.com, and they have a pretty lenient coupon-use policy if you're cheap like me."
VbqtbvvtNOe-YKA61-fSNA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"While the ambiance here is definitely nothing worth writing home about, you can't beat the reverse happy hour. $3.50 food items (hummus, mozzarella sticks, etc) bring me back from time to time. They also have some drink specials, including theme nights where you can get cheap margaritas, etc. Worth going at least once."
oj8qk3W7O9oq15VIs-vYJQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,1,"Lon's was a complete bust.  Mom took me for a ""nice"" Christmas dinner.  We succeeded on atmosphere, but that was about it.  While the service was just okay, the food was just terrible.  Keep in mind this was a Christmas Day prix fixe menu at $68/pp, which by Phoenix standards should be the best meal I've had all year.

Appetizers - some sort of sushi thing that was drowned in seaweed, tasted okay but was barely noticeable on the plate.  Also a lobster cake which was okay, came out cold, and wasn't nearly as good as the worst crab cake I've ever had.

Entrees - prime rib came out cold, and I've had better at a cheap buffet carving station.  Veal scallopini was chewy (kind of like a microwaved sponge), and had the most tasteless mozzarella cheese I've ever had.  When we brought this to the attention of the waitress, she asked that they remake all of our food.  About a half hour later we got a better (still not good) version of the veal, and opted to try the ravioli instead of the prime rib they had run out of.  At least the veal came out hot this time.  The ravioli wasn't bad, but probably had more oil than any other ingredient.  I felt greasy after eating it, which was a shame.  Neither of our meals seemed to have any inspiration or fresh ingredients whatsoever.

Desserts - what a sin.  I wonder if this place pays a pastry chef?  I'm spoiled by my step mom's bread pudding, so I understand when others don't step up to the plate, but the bread pudding here is something I would never waste a calorie on again.  And my ""apple pie"" was simply a joke.  It was clearly canned filling that they didn't even bother to heat, stuffed inside a dry pie shell that tasted like a mouth full of flour.  Ugh!

Our waitress sent the manager over, and he initially came off as unapologetic and insulted that we were unhappy.  He had to go to the table right next to us a few minutes later.  After we waited 20 minutes for our check, he came back again in a slightly better mood.  He explained that the kitchen was tired after being there since the morning and had lost their creativity.  OK I get it, I was tired too, but what kind of creativity do you need to heat up an unimaginative, standard menu?

The night ended with our two glasses of wine and one of our two meals comped.  It was the right thing to do, although I still don't feel like we received nearly a $70 meal.  With so many other locally-focused and inspired restaurants all over the valley, I would certainly recommend against dinner at Lon's.  If I were to go back, it would only be for a glass of wine out on the patio (although I can list a few places I'd rather go for that, too)."
p81LV6y6Jxz_q_3HL06jOw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"The scene is definitely better than the food, but I have to give it 4-stars for the happy hour menu.  In total they have over 20 items to choose from - sushi and appetizers, most under $5.  I believe it runs from 3p-7p.  Good looking wait staff and a nice decor.

Agreed - walking around Kierland is a nice way to work off lunch, or perhaps across the street to the Westin.

We'll be back for happy hour again!"
cz5vz-893D3LNH3TMQYR1w,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"While I normally don't frequent my 3-star places, Bliss/reBAR is still a go-to for me.  But there are just too many aspects to give it a solid rating.

Atmosphere-5 stars.  Always enjoy grabbing a few drinks at the outdoor bar at night.  During the day it functions as an awesome restaurant.  Trees surround the patio, making it a great outdoor eating spot with almost a whimsical feel.

Food-varies from 2 to 4 stars.  Pretzel buns are a must (if your food doesn't come on one, as them), and their nachos and mac-and-cheese have an awesome sauce.  It stops around there though, as salt and oil are clearly the favorite ingredients.  We got the two specials today-calamari tasted like nothing but salt, shrimp-and-grits were like a ship sinking in a sea of oil, and my eggplant/veggie sandwich was raining an oil monsoon.  Yuck!

Drinks-3 stars.  Pretty decent bar staff and generally great service.  If it's not super busy you might even catch a conversation with a bartender.  They could use a better beer selection though, since I can't justify any more $5 Fat Tires downtown.

I've never had an issue finding free street parking, check 4th St. or Garfield."
yHBhLawYmIthUPLbUXK5kw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,1,"It saddens me to write such a bad review for one reason - I might be Fuego Bistro's biggest fan.  So you can imagine how excited I was when I heard they were opening a taco place right around the corner from where I live.  Sometimes excitement quickly turns to disappointment and sadness, and such is the case with Fuego Tacos.

Let's just go start to finish:
-Salsa is inedible.  Way too spicy, and not good spicy, it's damn take this away spicy
-Drinks - half the size of the ones at Fuego Bistro, no good.  Not enough alcohol and the Sangria (which is top-notch at Bistro) tasted more like red Kool Aid
-Food - not so good.  I got the veggie tacos, which tasted more like a taco shell filled with sweet (not good-sweet, bad-sweet) corn salsa.
-Service - not too bad, but management response was a turn off.  We went in with Enamor coupons that clearly stated there were no limits, and they would only let us use one even though we were 2 parties with 2 checks.  Owner was called on the phone and didn't provide a great response.
-Atmosphere - would be awesome, but not for this place.  More of a trendy could-be club guised as a fancy taco place.

Please, check out the reviews for Fuego Bistro and go there.  It quite possibly offers the best food, service, and patio dining in Phoenix.  Fuego Tacos needs an overhaul, and I can for sure say I won't be back."
gxEkxkqQrrK62DJnXxXDLg,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"Nothing about this place thrilled me, but I suppose I'd go back again.  Well, I have to since I bought myself a gift card when they were on sale!

I found their branding a bit overpowering... Smashburger, Smashchicken, Smashsoda... ok, I get it.  But like the other reviews say, a burger's a burger, and Smash didn't seem to take the concept any further.

I got the Smashchicken Club (or smash-something like that).  It wasn't at all bad, but then what's bad when it's got chicken and avocado on it?  Smashavacado.

Smash.  I'll go back, but not tomorrow.  Smash."
y1VInN5m3RbHU59kiQbmxA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"So the update is, dinner is even more amazing than lunch.  And then we went back again for lunch, and it was even more amazing than dinner.  The service is purely unbeatable, and the food is right up there with the service.  At this point, I would just get the chef special or whatever the waitress recommends, because I've never been let down.  And definitely get the pineapple juice.  All you can drink for $2.50, fresh and delicious.  And the guacamole?  I'll let you try that for yourself, let's just say it might be better than my own."
Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"I'm consistently grateful to have a selection of the Upwards family of restaurants within walking distance to my house.  We call on Federal Pizza frequently if we don't feel like driving more than a few minutes for a good pizza night.  As expected, the vibe and service are top notch.  While Cibo and The Parlor still top my pizza list, I truly have no bad things to say of Federal's menu.  Get the roasted veggie board for a healthy appetizer like you've never tried before.  If the weather plays nice, grab a table on the patio and a few of their homemade wine coolers to share (but be careful, some can be way too sweet).  Take a walk down toward Practical Art to burn off that pizza crust after dinner!"
RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"This is the place to go to grab a drink with out-of-town visitors, hands down.

The restaurant is what it is, look to spend over $100 a person and stop at McDonald's on the way home to fill up.  If you have the money, or need a place for a fancy occasion, don't hesitate.  The service was great and the food delicious (at 5-star portions).

The great thing: you can get domestic bottled beer for $5, and some cocktails (including Bacardi) for $7.  My advice is to head into the bar, grab a drink, and find a spot at a table or couch outside.  You can see the entire valley, and relax by their fire pit/water feature.  Sunset is the best, although I'd recommend a drink before dark and another after.  In all fairness, they could charge you $10 just to come take a peek at their view, and you'd gladly oblige.

It's a great place to take photos, or maybe somebody you want to marry.  I'll stick to drinks, and you better bet you'll see me outside any time someone comes to visit!"
j-6MgWWlotFZAQ23LZrTPQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,2,"I've been eying the Trattoria since it opened, and finally got a chance to stop in last weekend.  I was excited about the ambiance - the place looks modern and fresh, and I had the impression the menu would wow me.

The service was great and the decor was fun - a great place to take a shopping break (or just cool off when its 115 out).  The menu was pretty exciting, but the food fell short.

Our Avocado Carpaccio was fun indeed - not what we would have expected, but definitely different and enjoyable.  The flavor combinations were interesting, and we commented that it could have passed as a dessert (not a bad thing).  But it was pretty small, certainly just a snack.

The Flatbread Chicken & Citrus Kale was the dish I was most looking forward to, and also most disappointed in.  The chicken itself was very dry and didn't have much flavor.  In fact, I didn't taste much of the sweet pea puree, crispy copa ham, fried egg, and definitely missed the white truffle oil.  The bread was fine, but again very dry.

I'm hoping I went on an off day, because the ambiance and service remind me of my favorite restaurants in town - I just wish the food did too."
Vw4m_3DyDQgMPU8ouj86ZQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"Walking into this place is just plain confusing.  You could tell it used to be something different, but I've got no idea what.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It just sort of looks cheap.  But that's ok.

The food was right on, and I'll be back for more.  Bento Box A?  Yes please.  Small salad with a great ginger-type dressing, some sort of spicy beef, teriyaki chicken, rice, egg roll, some edamame, a few carrots... am I missing anything?

The service was great, the food even better, and it only set me back about 5 minutes and 8 bucks.  It seems like a sure bet, and close enough to work for a good take out that it will rise toward the top of my list."
BvrG8XMpTtlJYWhOCbnpaQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"Mu Shu is the go-to place for lunch/dinner take out.

They have a menu, but why would you bother?  The build-your-own stir fry is the way to go.  Take your choice of chicken, shrimp, and whatever else they have... choices of sauce (go for the spicy garlic), and noodles, white or brown rice.  Then grab a bowl and stuff in as many veggies as you can.  The veggie bar is immaculate, and you can tell they use the freshest ingredients: onions, broccoli, bean sprouts, watercress, kale, tofu, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and probably 5 others I got.  I usually go with chicken, light spicy garlic sauce, and white rice.  It runs me about $7, and I end up saving half of it for a second meal.

The take-out service is super quick, and the staff couldn't be friendly.  It only took two take-outs to become a regular.  Be sure to ask for a stir-fry card (I believe its 11th one free), as you will be using it!"
bVv7r8emubqxWAnAk3abGw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"You mean you can get good BBQ in Phoenix too?  Amazing!  Another one of those places that took me a year to discover, which is probably good, since I'll be going here weekly.

One complaint and one complaint only - way too much sauce on the BBQ.  I mean, WAY too much.

Other than that, all expectations were exceeded.  The food was delicious, just as I remember BBQ should be.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, a slice of texas toast, a side of mac n' cheese, and an iced tea.  Even the iced tea was good.  Perfect flavors, served hot and fresh, and saucy.

I believe I was served by Stacy himself, who I guess just kind of does his own thing.  Like tell you how good the food is going to be.  He also has a knack for decorating - like using magic marker to give customers instructions on how to turn on the bathroom light, etc.  My favorite was the sign: ""You are on private property.  Don't touch the things on the walls.""  Or something like that, but the sign did capture the overall essence of the place, which I'm more than cool with.

BRING CASH!  Seriously, a credit card machine would not fit in at Stacy's."
ugmEOPSDyuKST64jXHZtVA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"I've only been once so far for lunch take out, but it was an easy 4-star experience.  I think the girl working the counter (and serving) was an absolute charm, and you could tell she loved working there.  The other staff seemed equally enthused.

I'm a fan of Cuban food, but not a fan of the lack Cuban food in the valley.  I was excited to find this gem hiding along I-17 the other day, and definitely expect to be back.

As for the food, I've only tried one thing, and it was kind of weird.  But listen to the name and the concept, and try to give me a reason not to try it?  Papo Relleno, which I think means stuffed, fried potato.  Which is the perfect name for this - baked potato, stuffed with chicken and stuff, and then deep fried.  It was kind of like a potato latke of sorts, not amazing but definitely worth the try.  It came with a ""salad"" (some lettuce underneath it, with what tasted like Italian dressing) and a thing of chicken soup.  Careful, they keep the soup hot - don't burn your tongue like I did!

Can't wait to go back, and will definitely be here before giving Havana Cafe another shot any time soon."
-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"I've grown to like Switch more and more.  Conveniently located right off the light rail (Central and Virginia), it makes a good spot for a weekend dinner or brunch.

I've never been let down by the food at Switch... standouts include the baked crab and lobster appetizer and the apricot-BBQ-feta chicken sandwich.

I lament about the drinks.  Maybe I've not ordered the right thing, but the few times I've had their drink specials, I can't help but notice they are pre-made and unfortunately taste accordingly.

Service is spot on 4 out of 5 visits and I like the atmosphere, so I'll be back again and again."
hU6sN5r6vayqm_RMgvPGOQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,2,"I can't find it in me to give this place more than two stars.

The atmosphere is not bad, pretty much expected for a wine bar.  However there are some tacky elements... our high-top table and both stools were annoyingly wobbly, and a member of the waitstaff was sitting at a computer using Facebook at the bar (klassy).

The service was terrible... to the point where we were ready to walk out if the waiter made one more trip past our table without so much as eye contact.  We walked to the bar for our second round of drinks after waiting with empty glasses for about 15 minutes (the same amount of time it took us to get our first round).

When the waiter to patron ratio is about 1:1, you'd expect a lot more...  I'm sticking to Postino."
vltL2SreTEeAiI4qLWUdnQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"The lentil soup is the star of this restaurant.  I wish they sold it by the gallon.

You could say Fattoush is kind of a hole in the wall, which I appreciate in an ethnic restaurant.  The decor is eclectic and seems to embody the spirit of the family owners.  If you expect fancy you may be disappointed, but if you expect a delicious meal at a fair price you'll be headed back for more.

Tonight I had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich (seasoned and served in a pita with tomatoes, pickles, and sauce) which, served with soup or salad at $6.95, was a steal.  And the tiny cup of Turkish coffee was just right.

The service is good and definitely very friendly.

Fattoush fits right in on that magical stretch of 19th Ave. between Indian School and Camelback, among so many great diverse food spots."
vYeSTLvRuTuWoZV6tmvAxw,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"Finally, a 5-star breakfast joint in a city that up until now hasn't wowed me with the morning food.

Wy-Knot fits right in with the other restaurants in its 7th Street stretch, perfectly delivering its niche-food and homey ambiance.  Most importantly, the people who work here are amazing.  You feel right at home, except the food is way better than anything you'll ever get at my house.

A trip here wouldn't be complete without trying their award-winning (literally) stuffed Cinnamon french toast.  It's to die for, so don't even think about ordering anything else.  Our table of 3 split that and a Prosciutto & Roasted Roma Tomatoes sandwich, served with goat cheese on a perfect ciabatta roll.  Sweet and savory, with an overdose of iced coffee.

Other reviews have mentioned that the food takes a while to prepare.  While I didn't find that to be the case, we did mention numerous times how this place has the perfect ""slow-breakfast"" vibe.  Not slow in that it took too long, slow in that we really enjoyed taking our time and spending our morning here.  It was fun to order one thing, split it, order something else, split it, and just hang for a while.  No complaints here.

The menu is priced very fairly in the $7-9 range, when they could easily charge more for some of their signature dishes.  This is something I appreciate, and will keep me coming back.

Dog-friendly patio?  Forget about it on a day like today with 113 degree heat... but my pooch will definitely be having Sunday Brunch out there with me in a few months."
RU2VtVZG8to-XVEHD-2qag,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"If grandma comes to town and tells you a place reminds HER of Key West, you know it's legit.  But I didn't need that sort of confirmation.

At first I wouldn't be caught dead eating anything other than the bananas foster french toast (and trust me, someone at your table NEEDS to get this dish - don't worry, the full size order is way more than enough to share).  But then, one day, I tried something else - the Local Breeze Omlet... whoa!  Scrambled eggs, Proscuitto, Goat Cheese, Asparagus, Tomato, Basil galore.

In the mood for lunch?  Just go for anything on the menu.  Salads, burgers, sandwiches... just point to something and you'll be pleased no matter what.

But the best suggestion I can give on this place is go for the weekend brunch.  You'll be glad you did.  And I feel obligated to share this secret, since I just learned of it this weekend myself...  Rocky Point eggs (trust me on this one).

Full disclosure: they stop serving breakfast foods around 11am.  DO NOT MISS THIS DEADLINE!  Also, although good, I would skip the sangria (and don't expect an $8 value out of your $8 mimosa).

Be sure to check out the bathroom before you go (go before you go?), it's pretty cool, like the rest of the place.  And, 10% discount if you ride your bike on the weekends.  Are you heading to Local Breeze yet?"

I'm all about ethnic foods, and Sekong will find itself toward the top of my list.  The most expensive menu item is $10, with most meals about $8.  Most meals come in combo form with rice, soup (Winter Melon at the time we went, delicious), an egg roll and some pickled vegetables.

The decor is awesome - warm and welcoming, with each table featuring a few Cambodian travel books.  Service is awesome and helpful.  The menu has just about anything you could want but it isn't overwhelming (don't worry, nothing is too adventurous)."

To enjoy a slice of their chocolate peanut butter pie is an absolute MUST!  The slices are huge, and they are so rich and delicious.  The other varieties of pie are good as well, but the chocolate peanut butter cannot be beat.

With that said, the food is just ok... or slightly worse.  I've eaten their twice and only go back for dessert now.  The salad bar is nice and the service is above-average.  Whatever you do, DO NOT GET GRAVY!  It is like some nasty, brown jello.

Everyone responded ""Pizzeria Bianco!,"" but a few wise ones told me to avoid the crazy wait and check out Cibo.  Still haven't made it to Bianco, but why bother?  I've been to Cibo 3 times in the past few months and wouldn't have it any other way.

The service has always been spectacular.  There's a good selection of beer and wine, and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas.  We're not talking New York thin-slice sauce-and-cheese, we're talking locally sourced ingredients and artful combination.  Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats, cheeses, and veggies galore.

Your least favorite part of the meal will definitely be trying to pronounce the names of the pizzas.  Your favorite part of the meal might be the pizza, or it might be the ambiance (hard to decide between the cozy outside with live music and fire pit or the quaint inside that boasts everything downtown Phoenix is good at).

Service - top notch. There's a small language barrier that makes ordering fun, and sort of surprising.
Food - must try. Go with a small group and just order everything. The food was admittedly too greasy on our second visit, but I'm still going back. The spinach thing is awesome, the sandwich ""bread"" is like none other, and the red sauce/dip is just awesome.

Tiki Time at Hula's is great, with $5 drink specials and food specials during the week.  Plus, how much better does Tiki Time sound than Happy Hour?  You can get that anywhere.

The salads are worth skipping, but everything else on the menu is outstanding.  If you're feeling healthy-ish, grab the black bean burger.  It's better than most hamburgers.  And of course get the sweet potato fries.

Other menu favorites are the spicy edamame appetizer, mac and cheese, and the Jawaiian Jerk Pork plate.  Save some of your diabetes for the coconut banana cream pie.

Whenever the weather permits, be sure to sit on the patio.  Warning - it will be hard to leave.  And if it starts to get chilly, snag a spot by the firepit.  Or just up at the bar."

Second points go to the food.  I really have no idea what I'm eating, but I've been a few times and haven't been disappointed.

Service/staff is pretty good, they definitely fit the theme of the place.

The Veal Parm and garlic bread both stood out, and I loved the sauce... something I don't often find myself saying.  The pasta fagioli was also quite delicious.  Of course, I think the home made tiramisu was probably my favorite, though I'm a sucker for sweets.

Good service, good authentic atmosphere, and a few tacky signs and menu reminders give off the charm you'd expect of a great, neighborhood Italian place.

All in all, we left around $50 with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert.  And we felt like we got the ""great"" birthday dinner we were in search of."

The outside is shady indeed, the inside is in fact shadier, and the food and service... you get the idea.  I ordered the beef and broccoli lunch which included fried rice - a safe bet at any Chinese place.  What I ended up with seemed like some sort of gelatinized beef fat... at least I hope.  If it wasn't fat, I have no clue what it was.  And the fried rice looked something like rice, but I don't even know how to describe what it tasted like.  Needless to say, I didn't take 3 bites of the plate before throwing it out.  And I kind of feel sick just thinking about it.

I haven't found a great Chinese place in Phoenix yet, but I can guarantee you I'd avoid even driving past this place -- and I suggest you do the same."
ALwfJk1g56dz8ehgYJNrdg,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"If you love NY pizza, you will love Mama Mia 9 out of 10 times.  As a New Yorker myself, I can say that Mama Mia takes care of the craving for good, real, NY pizza.  And you can't beat the deal... $4 for 2 slices and a can of Coke.

The only issue I have with Mama Mia is that 1 time out of 10, when something just isn't quite right.  I can't tell you what it is because I don't know, but I end up throwing the pizza out.  And then I usually take a break from Mama Mia for about 2 weeks.  But, 9 out of 10 times, the food is spot on.

If you haven't yet, be sure to give Mama Mia a try!"
sS__otwzn0INyR_5Dimfdg,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"I'd give this place an extra half star if I could, just because it used to be a Wendy's.

I think this is probably as close to ""authentic"" as you're going to find.  They have all the usual suspects of a Mexican joint: tacos, quesadillas, and of course the salsa bar (I think this was a remnant of when Wendy's had salad bars, remember that?  circa early 1990s).

The service is good, and the food is delicious.  I would suggest a giant (and they are giant) chicken quesadilla, with a bunch of guacamole on the side.  The cheese is melty and delicous!  I would avoid the steak as it is quite tough, but to be fair I've never had good steak from a good mexican restaurant.

And they have Mexican Coke in glass bottles, which usually always makes me go back for more."

fskIA-YRflPnwHWL7Q8bLg,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"I'd been craving Cuban food ever since I left Florida, and I couldn't have been more thrilled after our meal at Havana Cafe.  I wouldn't sit inside, as the atmosphere kind of sucks, but the patio was great in the recently-awesome weather.  The service was great... the waiter knew the menu inside and out, had great recommendations, and was the guy who remembers your order without a pad and somehow doesn't screw it up.

Sangria-Delicious
Mojitos-Same
Seviche (spelled that way) -Ditto
Gambas y Pollo-See Above
Pumpkin Soup (seasonal)-Best I've Had

The bad - I think they are pretty over-priced for Cuban food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but I don't think Cuban food should fall in the $20/plate range.  You need a key to get into the restrooms, which makes it feel kind of like a gas station.  You also get a feel that most male customers just go behind the dumpsters, not that I did that...

This place would have been an easy 5-stars except for one thing, that totally blew the experience.  The waiter automatically added a 20% tip to the bill, on top of tax.  Ordinarily he would have earned it.  But when questioned, he said they always do that on large parties.  We were a party of 5.  He was extremely arrogant about it, saying nobody's ever questioned it.  Totally ruined the whole evening.  And of course, there was no mention of an auto-tip on the menu, go figure.  I could understand if there were 10 of us, you get it.

Overall, I would be excited to go back again.  It's a great place to go if you are craving some pretty good authentic food in the valley that isn't Mexican.  Grab a $28 pitcher of sangria and/or a few mojitos, splurge on some appetizers, and go for just about anything on the menu.  Nobody in our group left disappointed, with the food at least."
Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"I want SO badly to give Crescent Ballroom a 5-star review, because really it is nearly a 5-star place.

First off, the concert venue is perfect for Phoenix.  It is small enough to be extremely intimate, yet large enough that you don't feel cramped and can step away almost enough to have a conversation while the music is loud.  Drinks are reasonably priced, and there are 2 bars that generally don't have a huge wait.  Did you say you could buy a burrito to eat during the concert? Heck yes!  The sound quality and lighting are both pretty good, and they bring in great local acts.  I think they have a concert nearly every night of the week, and tickets are rarely expensive.

Second, the lounge area is pretty awesome.  There is never a cover to get in, and you can generally hear the concerts from there as well.  Most nights there is a DJ that plays some pretty sweet music, and people seem to always be happy.  There are a number of high-tops and tables if you want to chill, and by midnight people tend to create a little dance floor.

I don't have much experience with the food here, but the burrito I had was pretty good and I've heard good things.  Check that out for yourself.

So, why only 3 stars?  The big reason is the smoking.  Crescent has a sizable patio area in the front of the building, and it draws quite the hipster crowd.  I love hipsters.  But I hate hate hate how much they smoke.  Every single person on the patio is smoking at all times.  The problem here?  The patio has giant doors that open the lounge up to the outside, and the hipsters are essentially smoking inside.  Not in 2012, not in my book.  It kills me.

Reason number two for the star-deduction: what is wrong with the grapefruit juice here?  I've been told by every bartender that it's fresh-squeezed, and I have no reason to doubt that.  But seriously, there is something major wrong with it.  I've tried it with all of my favorite vodkas, and it just fails each time.

So, here's what you do.  Drop by one night, they're open until 2am every night.  Check out a concert if you can, for $10 who really cares if you know them or not.  Grab a drink at the bar and stay as far from the patio as you can.  And grab an Odell IPA, they never disappoint."
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,5,"Top choice for pizza in the Biltmore area for sure.  So good!  The ambiance is great, perfect for a date or small group.

This is the kind of place where you want to order a bottle of wine and an appetizer, hang out for a while, get and share a pizza, hang out for a while, get and share another pizza... you get the idea.

I forget exactly what we ordered, but I do remember getting the night's special pizza and being absolutely blown away.  The service was awesome, the type where you want to become friends with the staff.  And the food top-notch.

Free valet parking, great atmosphere, great wine... although I take no credit for choosing.  That's my job when it comes to pizza, and I can do my job quite well here."
8nP8ghEpT6WFcM6tfqAaGA,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"I'm disappointed to find out the ice cream isn't home-made.  It was good though.

We were excited to find this out-of-place ice cream joint in the middle of Old Town.  The decor is fun for an ice cream shop, and I was thrilled to sit at the counter and order a treat.

I wish the place didn't smell so bad.  It's really off-putting... spilled, spoiled milk must be everywhere.

But overall, its a good value for the money (you won't spend more than $5-6) and a cute place to stop in for a cool-off."
STtrEGylaYOXoXQFLP5OAQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,3,"I'm sad not to offer this place a 5-star review, because I sure wanted to.  Going for drinks?  Hit up the Rum Bar (same place) and you won't be disappointed.  Not that you'd be disappointed by the food, you just won't feel the same wow factor you get from the drinks.

Everything they make is good, you simply can't deny that.

Value?  Not so much.  Sure, most plates are in the $10-$15 range, but they are small if just enough.  The wait staff is friendly, but almost in the used car salesman way.  Upsell?  Yep, at every course.  I usually walk out between $25-$35 before drinks.  Never disappointed, but I wouldn't go there for food unless someone specifically wanted to."
VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"Yum!  An awesome Italian restaurant in the middle of sketch-ville.

Tonight I tried the cheese ravioli (take out), and was pretty impressed... Impressed enough to tell everyone at work they might have been the best ravioli I've ever had.

All of their pastas are homemade, and it shows.  The pasta was light, fresh and delicious, as was the cheese inside.  The sauce screamed fresh, and had the perfect spicy bite to it.

An added bonus were the little pita-like things that I suppose come with all entrees.  They came from the wood fire oven, which smelled incredible while inside the restaurant.

Here's the deal... it's not the best part of town, but you won't get stabbed or mugged here, so park your car and come inside for some gooooooood food."
VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ,VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA,4,"I'm sad it's taken me over a year of living just down the road to finally make it to Bobby Q.  I think it was because I moved from Florida, where BBQ is delicious and cheap, and I was reluctant to ""splurge"" on pulled pork at a place like this.

The ambiance is fantastic, you feel great walking in.  The last star was left off for service, which I wasn't a huge fan of.  We were attended to just fine, but I wasn't a fan of our waiter's demeanor.  He didn't seem to know the menu well, which is a shame because it isn't huge.  I kind of felt like he was reading a script, emphasizing the whole ""smoked for 18 hours"" thing, which rubbed me the wrong way.

But aside from the waiter not being invited to my Christmas party, the place was great.  The food was really delicious, and well worth the money.  I believe that with an appetizer, any 2 people could easily share any entree.

I do have to say this - if you go, do NOT skip out on the banana dessert.  OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I am a freak for banana pudding, but this treat is on a whole new level.  It was thick and custardy, cold and delicious.  The best part was the crust, which was almost granola-esque.  I've never had anything like it, and doubt I ever will... until I go back to Bobby Q for some more!"
V7nossAF0dFj_mSPYj6SSQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"TV's galore.  Wing flavors a-plenty.  And a fairly decent variety of brews on tap.  Our server was very friendly, happy to help out us newbies.  She brought out a bunch of different wing sauces for us to try before we ordered.  We opted for the Wild sauce and spicy garlic - both tasty!  Will definitely be back to grab some more wings and check out a big game."

Always a line at the drive-through, but the service is fast, and I don't think I've ever had anything wrong with my order. They don't have a specific kids menu, but they do offer stickers to kids, and as far as my kid is concerned, stickers are as good as any toy."
4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"4 stars for service; 2 for food on the day of that gets slightly better as leftovers.  I was really hoping that I was going to love this place because it's very clean, the owners/servers are very nice, and the overall feel of the place is better than many of the other Chinese restaurants in the area.  But I found the broccoli chicken and Mongolian beef to be very bland; the flavors only slightly perked up the next day when I ate the leftovers."
w2gXToEf9ba78Qfmp42YRQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,5,"Genuinely friendly employees. Fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. What I really like, though, is that the kids meals come with books!  And they even have board books for kiddos under 3! If you have a smaller appetite, you could order the kid's meal for yourself and then give the book to your kid.  Win-win!"
cmsAFAymfVoBitSF8R6GKw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"We started with veggie spring rolls which were nicely fried and not too greasy as spring rolls can tend to be at times.  Next up was the wor won ton soup.  It was full of all kinds of veggies as well as pieces of chicken, beef and shrimp.  The won tons themselves tasted a little too ginger-y, but if you get some of the broth in your bite, they taste just fine.  Our main course consisted of Mongolian Beef and Broccoli Chicken.  The Mongolian Beef was sufficiently flavorful, though the dish is a bit deceiving - it looks like you're getting a big plate of meat, but really the meat is served over crispy, white noodles, so it's not as much meat as you think.  The Broccoli Chicken had PLENTY of chicken which was nice because a lot of times with this dish you'll get way more broccoli than meat.

The owner was very sweet and came by a couple of times to make sure everything was OK.  It was also obvious that she knew, or was at least familiar with a few of the other patrons, which is cool because you know that people are repeat diners.

Total bill was about $35 for two of us, with no alcohol.  The menu also features dinner combo specials for $11.50 pp and even cheaper lunch specials.  This is a very casual place that definitely has the potential to become my ""go-to"" Chinese restaurant.  I have to try a few more in the area before I settle on one..."

Good thing I was starving.  On a normal day, I'll have to remember to get the ""Little Cheeseburger"".  The cajun fries have a little bit of a kick... nothing crazy, just a little flavor.  The thing that I was most entertained by was the super awesome digital Coke fountain machine.  There must've been at least 50 different flavors of Coke products, many of which I've never heard of like Raspberry Coke or Orange Coke."

Well, I'm glad I did because it was really fresh and really delicious here.  The variety of food that you can order here is so interesting!  My husband and I have enjoyed sushi, pad thai, and pizza all in the same meal.  Some of my favorite items include the edamame, salmon nigiri, Philadelphia roll and the Macadamia Nut Chicken."
_ljTuSJrLGUe7m6ojcysjQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"We come to Chilis probably once every two months.  The Boneless Buffalo Wings are a must on every visit.  Which I guess is kind of a bummer because we never get the Chips and Queso anymore - also a great choice.

If I'm being smart, I'll order the soup and salad as my entree, and then I won't be overly stuffed by the end of the meal.  However, on most occasions, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I'll order an Oldtimer with Cheese (Chili's cheeseburger) or the Chicken Caesar Pita.  Both sandwiches come with Chili's wonderful french fries, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.  On the very rare occasion, I'll have room for dessert, and Chili's offers these great shot glass desserts that give you just enough of a taste of sweetness.  If you can somehow save room for the Chocolate Molten Cake, DO IT!  Might be worth visiting Chilis JUST for the Chocolate Molten Cake.

This particular location has offered consistently friendly service.  As another option, the phone-in/take-out service is easy and convenient."
L8qHCpeeF2_5RN_5RJQyYg,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"When you see the word ""Tavern"" in the name of a place, your first thought probably isn't ""Hey, I bet this place is kid-friendly!"" But in this instance, you'd be wrong, my friend. It's loud, crowded, and the floor is covered in peanut shells (mommy translation = your kid can throw a fit complete with screaming and throwing food on the floor, and nobody would even notice!)  They don't show a kids' menu online, but they do have one that has your normal selection of kid fare, as well as a handful of crayons and pictures to color. The adult menu has a nice selection of pub fare: appetizers, soup, salad, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  Interestingly, they also have a breakfast menu. I'm a big fan of hot wings and let me tell you, the suicide wings are no joke. The menu warns to ""order at your own risk"" and you'd be wise to heed the advice. And of course, being a tavern, they have a full bar. Great drink prices!"
Ws8V970-mQt2X9CwCuT5zw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"This restaurant has so many great things going for it.  Comfy seating areas, big variety of desserts (displayed in a glass case so that you're tempted by all of them), a full menu loaded with breakfast/lunch/dinner options and of course, an awesome selection and variety of teas (not to mention the cool tea pots that they come in.)  You can reserve space for a private event and they offer tea classes.  Oh yeah, I can't forget about all of the tea cups, tea pots, and teas available for sale.

I came here with Ashley A. and Kym C. for our book club, and while I thought our waitress was helpful at times, I thought she could've been more attentive.  Perhaps she was just trying to leave us alone, recognizing we were there to chat.  Not feeling very adventurous, I went with a green tea which was great.  I also ordered a butter croissant, that unfortunately I would not recommend.  It was very dense and overloaded with butter; I would've preferred light and fluffy with just a taste of butteriness.

Even given the heavy croissant, I'd rate this place highly based on the ambiance and teas - that's really what you come here for, right?"
OMm3KPJkkbfq3SMXqhZ0uQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"It's interesting how different their food is depending on where/when you eat it.

I usually get the Italian sub, and while it's great if you eat at the restaurant, it's a very wet sandwich and doesn't travel well.  It's not great if you get it to go and let it sit more than 10 minutes before eating it.  It's soggy and downright bad if you get it delivered.

The buffalo wings are pretty good with a nice kick of heat.  The french fries are crunchy and salty - pretty darn tasty.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the prices are a bit higher than other sub places, but if you get a coupon in the mail or from a previous order, you can save a few bucks."
0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I don't know how it is that I've been here a million times and have yet to review it.

I usually come for lunch or dinner and have enjoyed burgers, hot dogs, chili dogs, fries and salads on several occasions.  Their dark chocolate shake is really thick and rich.  But I recently came for brunch, and while the line was LONG and I had to wait in it for about 30 minutes before ordering, the meat and potatoes scramble was definitely worth it!

Lots of outdoor seating makes for a really fun picnic-type atmosphere that is as family-friendly as it gets.

Anyway, there are 135 other reviews on this place, so the bottom line is: just try it!  It's good!"

Salads, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, pasta, desserts.  You want it, you can probably get it here.  The salad and half-sandwich combo is a great choice for lunch and is not too filling.

The great thing about this restaurant is that they are very accommodating to large parties and allowed our large party of 15 to pay on separate checks.  Big props for that because a lot of restaurants just won't do that."

The ordering via phone was unique and the service was quick and friendly.  It almost felt like I was eating at a full-service restaurant by the way every worker that passed asked if everything was all right and if they could get us anything else.  The restaurant was also well-kept.  I try not to make it a habit to eat footlong chili dogs and tator tots, but when I get a craving, this is a great spot to get them!"

One thing that I appreciate about this place is the hours.  The dining room is open until midnight and the drive-thru is 24 hours.  Not too many places in this neighborhood are open that late, so it's nice if you want a late night bite.

The food was OK.  I probably should've tried one or more of the many salsas from the salsa bar, but I like to first try food on its own before adding anything to it, and then I was just feeling to lazy to get up and get some salsas.

I had the two chicken tacos meal.  For some reason, I found the first taco to be more flavorful than the second.  That actually worked out to my benefit because it stopped me from stuffing myself silly.  The rice was pretty standard Mexican rice and the beans were as well, but they were served with a lot of shredded cheese on top... and lots of cheese will make just about anything taste good.

This is the kind of place that I might visit again when I'm feeling like Mexican food, don't feel like traveling too far for it, and don't feel like spending too much on it.  Also a great late night option."

We enjoyed a terrific lunch that included a little of everything - sushi, edamame, miso soup, teriyaki chicken, and salad.  Service was friendly and prices were very competitive.  I found a 20% off coupon on their website after the fact, so I'm looking forward to going back and enjoying another meal!"
EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"Since there are no .5 star options, I'm going to round up in this case... but I think 3.5 would be a fair score.

The food is good enough, but didn't blow me away.  Though, did you see them on ""Diners Drive-Ins and Dives""?  The pork really does fall of the bone in the Osso Bucco dish.  The garlic bread appetizer consists of 4 pieces of bread, and no real garlic.  The prosciutto and melon was good, but the prosciutto was not as soft, or maybe not as fresh (?) as I've had.  The lasagna is a surprisingly small portion, but is filling enough.  And the chicken parmesan is a giant portion that leaves you with probably too much food for lunch leftovers, but perhaps would be better as dinner the next night.

I thought it was really reasonably priced.  The total including tax and tip for our party of 4 was just under $150 and that included 2 appetizers, a soup, 4 entrees, 1 dessert, and 1 bottle of wine.

You know how you have your ""go-to"" restaurants in your neighborhood?  They're the defaults when you want a decent, reasonably priced meal in a familiar place.  The food may not be the best ever, and there is usually no ambience, but they're close and they fulfill your craving for that type of cuisine.  Well, if this restaurant was in my neighborhood, if it were slightly bigger, and if it had real chairs, it might be my ""go-to"" Italian restaurant."

They seem to have this side of the business mastered, and it's a surefire way to get quick, friendly service and your food in hand within 15-20 minutes after calling in."

It is the type of restaurant where you place your order at a counter, find a place to sit, and then they bring your food to you.  They can get quite busy during peak meal times, but they are efficient at finding open tables for you, so you're never wandering around looking for a table after you've ordered.

They are locally-owned and use a lot of fresh, locally grown ingredients, so that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when I eat there.  Pizzas, salads, and sandwiches are all delicious, but what deserves an extra special shout out is the dessert case.  The gigantic cinnamon roll is perfection.

Can't think of enough good things to say; just go check it out for yourself."

At 7:45 p.m., there was a long line of people out the door - no way am I *waiting* for Red Robin, we'll have to try another time.  Went back again on a Sunday at 5 p.m.  No wait at all, though the place was on the busier side for this time on a Sunday night.  The waiter was fine - got the orders right, brought timely refills on the drinks.  He hustled, but acted too busy to actually be friendly; I don't think the place was *that* busy.  The burgers were flavorful as were the unlimited steak fries.  Dinner was inexpensive, especially with that coupon ($28 total, including tip.)  Will definitely come again when I want another burger."

The hashbrowns were on the greasy side, but that didn't bother me; it's just that nothing blew me away either.  The service was a bit slow considering we got there at about 6:50 a.m. and there were open tables; so I can only imagine how it would be at any other time of the day."

The General Chicken, which I've found is a totally different dish at every restaurant, was drowning in sauce, but had a nice little spice to it.

If possible, I would've given 3.5 stars - 4 for atmosphere and service, which were by far the nicest of any of the Chinese restaurants that I've been to in the area so far and 3 for the food."

Since I'm a big fan of wor won ton soup and am always looking for the best out there, I also ordered that to give it a try.  Like a previous review, I found the won ton soup to be very fresh and satisfying and it was probably my favorite part of the meal.  The hot and sour soup was also good; it didn't seem hot at first, but as I continued eating it, I could taste a little bit of heat kicking in.  Because there was so much food, I didn't eat the fried won tons or the egg roll.  The cashew chicken was a tad salty, but mix it with the steamed rice and you're good to go.  A solid ""A-OK."""
mXyLqsbe7FT1X8ZFOP8WpQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I love how every category of the menu has some form of buffalo chicken.  Buffalo chicken wings appetizer, buffalo chicken salad, buffalo chicken sandwich, buffalo chicken wrap...  Of course, there are lots of other salads, sandwiches, wraps, and dishes on the menu, but they had me at buffalo chicken.

I got the wrap and thought the buffalo sauce added a nice bit of flavor, but wasn't too hot.  The blue cheese in the wrap is delicious, but does take over a bit, so I'd only recommend this if you are a big blue cheese fan.  I got the wrap with steak fries which were nicely seasoned (i.e. salty, but not too salty).

The service was great and the restaurant in general felt very clean and kept up. The bathroom was seemingly luxurious for this sports bar type of atmosphere.  There are 3 stalls in the ladies room with real walls and doors separating them.  Nice baby changing station in the stall by the sink."
tK-PQOhZo94fonbQVXaOSg,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just don't expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters.

The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons!

General Tso's chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef.

Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery."
LhBP1BxWBM3aLLRR4zgQlw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"This is the only restaurant in town that I've had to wait for a table.  That's not a bad thing, just an observation.

A note on the food... I'd go with pizza over pasta here.  I've had both, but prefer the pizza.  Pizza comes in thin, stuffed, or thick (pan) crust.  However, if you want a LOT of pasta, order that because you won't be disappointed with the vast quantity of food that you get.  Try to save room for dessert.  The ""original pizza cookie"" is just like a pazookie from BJ's, but possibly bigger.

A note on the service... If you order a dish that has a long prep time, they are good about letting you know ahead of time so that you're not wondering where your food is 45 minutes later."
aVTcYZ1h7QoF_lDdH_RLqg,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"Since I have not had the chance to partake in their happy hour, my review will be based solely on the food and service.

Probably the best thing about this place is value for your money.  Yes, you do have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but when you can get a burrito for $6.95, it ends up being a great value.  With a few sprinkles of salt, the chips were good and the salsa bar gives you the chance to enjoy different flavors with your chips (and meal.)

I had the carnitas burrito which was tasty, but was made unevenly such that all the rice was on one side and all of the carnitas and beans were on the other side.  Not too big of a deal; I just had to be strategic in piecing together my bites.  The nice thing is that it was a good size burrito; not some ""as big as your head"" monstrosity.

I was full after the meal so I didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts, but the Kahlua brownie with ice cream sounded delicious.  Maybe next time..."
iqL35L6AdFMMkRrAcK1uLQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,5,"Excellent beer and wine selection.  I love that you can buy a single bottle of beer - if you want to just try something out, you don't have to commit to a six-pack.  Great prepared foods section - I had a hard time choosing between a sandwich, soup, build-your-own salad, pizza, and sushi (just to name a few of your options.)  I opted for the sushi and was not disappointed.  Fresh fish made to order.  I'll definitely be returning!"
uU8up3hGwW9qnzQD1HZsMQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"We started with the Spring Rolls which were crispy, and not overly oily like these deep fried goodies can sometimes be.  For the main course, we ordered 2 small dishes - Beef with Broccoli and Garlic Chicken.  It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people.  The Beef with Broccoli was probably close to half beef, half broccoli, so that was good.  The Garlic Chicken had a little spice to it which was tasty, though I really couldn't distinguish any garlic flavor.  The restaurant does have a few tables, so you could eat in, but it seems like it's really more set up to be a take-out joint.

I need to try the won ton soup and Mongolian beef before I can give a better or worse rating.  For now ""A-OK"" is a good description."
6RklCXxHQ74wcGdyaxOmow,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,2,"I generally don't love chain restaurants, nor do I feel the need to review them because of their general mediocrity, but being from the SF bay, Ruby Tuesday was new to me and I always like to give new-to-me restaurants a shot.  Their website makes everything look so delicious.  That was my first mistake though, right?  Never believe the pictures.

Having gone at an off-peak hour (about 8:30 p.m.) in an off-peak season (summer, so I heard the waitress tell another table) I would've expected prompt service and fresh food.  However, this was not so.  Our waitress had a total of 2 tables and she had gotten so caught up in chatting with the other table that our food sat under heat lamps for who knows how long.  (You can always tell when that happens by how hot your plate is when they serve it to you.)  Our burgers were over-cooked, almost to the point of being rubbery, and the fries were luke-warm.  Ate enough to get full and threw the rest away.  Oh well, now I know."
G60mnTWpe1J13fWhIGlmxA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I think one of their mottos is something like, ""Delivery so fast you'll freak"" and they are not kidding!  Now granted, I used to work right across Baseline, so they didn't have far to travel, but I would order online, click Submit, and the delivery guy would be at my office door within 5 minutes.  Freaky fast!  How is that even possible?

I would estimate that the Sub sandwiches have about half of the contents of the Giant Club Sandwiches.  While I really enjoy the Italian Night Club, I just can't finish it, so I switched the Vito and that's just right.  The sandwiches don't have pickles on them, but you can order a giant deli pickle on the side and they offer it whole, halved, or quartered.

The online ordering system is really efficient and allows you to order exactly what you want; plus this, minus that, extra this, etc.  Are they the greatest subs in the whole world?  Well, no, but they are good and the price and quick service make it a great deal.

My new office is just 2 miles away (still within the delivery range) so I'm interested to find out how fast delivery will be."
Dj8MfG5-UGbjp9GxaNnGxQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"Get the queso!  Actually, I enjoy both the queso and the salsa; they are also good together.  The chips are huge; you'll have to break them up to make them manageable.  I've tried all of the enchilada flavors now and prefer the beef ones just because they come with red sauce.  The rice is a little sweet because of the corn, and the beans have a hint of a roasted flavor.  If at all possible, save room for the kahlua ice cream pie - delicious!"
_R2r4SlngDt9X2K1UZyWXw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I find this Paradise Bakery to be very clean and inviting.  It is a very comfortable place to sit back and visit with friends.  It's also a good place to come if your internet at home is down because they offer free wi-fi.

The cookies are divine.  I tried the chocolate chip and peanut butter, and while these can tend to be pretty plain choices, these cookies were anything but plain - they were moist and chewy!  I went on a Monday and they were buy 1, get 1 free.  Don't know if it was a special or what, but I was happy to get 2 cookies and a soda for about $3.

I need to come back and try some of their soups, salads, and sandwiches and update later.  If their cookies are representative of the rest of their food, I'm sure I'll enjoy it very much."
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"Being a newbie to Chino Bandido, I got to take advantage of the free samples and lesson on how to order.  I thought everything individually was delicious, but once everything was together on my plate, I wasn't so sure of the mix of flavors.  I ordered a carne asada burrito, teriyaki chicken, fried rice and refried beans.  I ultimately ate the burrito and beans together and then ate the rice and teriyaki together; otherwise, it was opposing flavors overload.  I will definitely return again if I find myself in the neighborhood, but I may just stick with a rice bowl or a combination that doesn't mix so many different flavors."
WEoivlVObGE03PiWvVvXYA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"Been here 2 times.  Had I reviewed after my first visit, I would've given the place 4 stars.  The server was nice and attentive and the food and drinks were delicious.  Had I reviewed after my second visit, I would've given the place 2 stars.  The server was quiet and not as attentive and the food was cold and bland.  Since I'm just now getting around to reviewing, I guess I'll give it 3 stars.  Really a bummer when you enjoy a place once only to go back and have a no-so-great experience."
wcNvlrB5xSxzXex2M3UyvQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,2,"Visited Hazelwoods today for Yelp Book Club.  While I had a blast talking with the group about the book, I was less than thrilled with the restaurant.  Was the service bad because of the USA/Canada gold medal hockey game?  There were a lot of people there, but I wouldn't necessarily call it ""crowded.""  The only way to get the waitress to come to our table was by flagging her down.  Even that didn't work sometimes.  On the bright side, I actually enjoyed my French Dip quite a bit.  But the lack of quality service trumps the food in this case.  Plus, it's far from where I live, so I won't be back."
QBN_TcWQ1mZrzekFM4p0LA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"We came to Buca di Beppo on Christmas day because nobody wanted to cook!  Being that it was Christmas day, this was probably one of the only restaurants that was open and they were sure busy!  Luckily, we had reservations.  Our reservations were for 4:15 and we got there on time and were seated just  minutes after checking in.  We saw others come in without reservations and the wait time was a whopping 2.5 hours.  Ouch.  They were so busy, in fact, that while we waited for our table, we heard the workers say, ""That's it on to-go orders!  No more to-go!"" In addition, we were seated next to the bar and by the time we were leaving (around 6 p.m.) we heard the bartender say that they were pretty much out of everything.  (They were still going to be open another 2-3 hours.)  Lucky for us, none of these things affected our meal.  Our server was nice and efficient.  We enjoyed a long meal starting with bread with oil and vinegar and the calamari appetizer, on to the apple and gorgonzola salad and minestrone soup, followed by our main course of Chicken Parmesan and some kind of spicy Penne dish.  I imagine that the busy staff must've felt stressed and pressure to turn tables, but we never felt rushed and were able to enjoy our meal.  They did not cut any corners on the food or service and to me, everything seemed on par with a normal night here.  I'd happily come back on another Christmas day, keeping in mind that reservations are a necessity and the earlier, the better to avoid not being able to get what you want because of potential food or drink shortages."
SotrpltgrAJBqNGZlbYUNA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,5,"Why did it take me so long to try this place?! Well, it's because there is almost always a line out the door. But now I understand why. The restaurant is tiny, but they can turn tables relatively quickly, and the food is fabulous! The cinnamon roll is to die for! It would be a meal in and of itself for one person. We split it among 3 people which let us share in the deliciousness, but not spoil our appetites as there was much more food to come. I got the ham and cheese scramble, which came with home fries, and I was able to eat almost half of it. Even as leftovers one day later, it was still excellent. They do a cute Mickey Mouse pancake with whipped cream for kids that my daughter thoroughly enjoyed. We took some of that home as well, and as with my food, it was still tasty in its encore show. We will definitely be coming back as we have only scratched the surface of the breakfast menu, and there's a whole lunch menu, too!"
AtSEe-B2mFmLFHBf4PLTrw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I got a taste of the braised beef sandwich at Yelp in Bloom and today was my first chance to try it in its full glory.  There was no way I should've finished the whole thing. But I did, and true to the sample from Yelp in Bloom, it was delicious! Beef and mashed potatoes in a sandwich served with au jus and horseradish on the side. The sandwich also comes with regular and sweet potato chips. I also enjoyed the blackberry orange lemonade. The place was quite busy due to the book signing by Chelsea Handler going on next door at Changing Hands, but the workers hustled and the place remained clean and pleasant. Super friendly service adds to the appeal of this location."
36GvUjLg3drdOB3jgpqTOQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"We came in at about 8:45 on a Friday night and could see a bunch of empty tables as we walked in, so we were kind of shocked when the hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait, but that we could wait in the bar.  Well, the bar was super crowded and I didn't feel like wading through the crowd, so we decided to just wait it out on the bench at the front entrance.  To our pleasant surprise, we were shown to our table after waiting only 10 minutes.  Was the 45-minute quoted wait time just a ploy to get us to spend money in the bar?  That was the only part of the experience that put a bad taste in my mouth.

The complimentary chips and salsa were quite good; I just had to add a tiny bit of salt to the chips.  They had a great selection of margaritas ranging in price from about $10 to $25.  For dinner, I had the taco/enchilada combo plate.  It was enough food that I felt satisfied, but not overly stuffed.  The refried beans were on the runny side, but still tasty.  The rice had tiny bits of green pepper in it - not really my thing, but may be of interest to someone else.  My husband had the carne asada burrito; I had a small bite and found the meat to be nicely marinated and perfectly cooked.  The waitress couldn't have been sweeter or more helpful in answering questions about the menu.  We'll definitely be back and maybe next time we'll try the fried ice cream dessert."
ipFobdM6X_4SNMA9ZBfdAQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,5,"I've never had a pita with a pickle in it before, but I like it!

Awesome kid's menu - the little ones can choose one each of a veggie, a grain, a protein, and a fruit for $4.99.  And their meal includes a drink.  Last time I went, I mentioned to the waitress that I didn't want to order a whole kid's meal for my daughter and that I was considering just getting a side of something for her, and the waitress informed me that I could order anything off of the kid's menu a la carte.  Sweet!

The place is packed at lunch time, but the wait is not usually too long.  The food and friendly service are worth it."

The menu consists of burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries, and ice cream goodness.  There are a few kinks to work out as my trip through the drive-through took about 10 minutes, and there were only 2 cars ahead of me, but overall the service was very friendly.

I thought this was an interesting location for Iceberg with a Sonic right across the parking lot, and the menus being so similar.  But I thought Iceberg was better than Sonic, so hopefully they'll do just fine here."

I subconsciously breathed through my mouth in an attempt to cool it down and my dragon fire breath burned my husband's eyes.  Try them... if you can handle it!
gcNC4k7TZJVX_1YHdIkDNQ,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,5,"I came to Glendale to check out the Midwestern campus for school. I come from the San Francisco Bay Area and one of my favorite comfort foods is good sushi so I knew that if I came here for grad school, I would need to check out the local sushi spot. After finding this local spot, I knew I needed to support this place and write a good review even though I hardly ever write reviews.

So, after touring the campus, I looked on yelp and found this place. I drove around. It's a little hard to find. There's an electronic sign above that says Sushi. It was in one of those little shopping centers, but not a big one. At least there's free parking.

Walking in, it was completely empty. It was a Tuesday night. I found simple chairs and tables, but there was also bar with the sushi chef standing behind it. Immediately, (probably because I was the only one there) the chef and the hostess greet me. I'm pretty sure they are a married couple.

They directed me to sit at the bar. I usually always try and sit at the bar because I love watching the chef prep the food, but I told them that I had been out all day and was in desperate need to plug my phone in and charge it. They laughed and the wife directed me to one of the other tables that had a plug underneath and I finally started charging my phone. There was a flat screen tv up in the corner displaying the NBA playoffs.

So, I sat down and immediately I start talking with both the chef and his wife. Well, I'm kinda yelling back and forth with the chef since I'm not sitting at the bar and they start asking me about how I found the place and all normal small talk stuff.

I went on to explain them that I was in the area only for the day and wanted to decide whether or not I wanted to go to school in Phoenix. They talked to me about their experiences and where they had lived and so forth and how they had adjusted to living in Glendale. Supposedly, the sushi chef used to be a pretty popular sushi chef in Las Vegas but wanted to open his own place, or something like that.

Well, I finally got around to the menu and noticed the prices. I guess they have only been open for about 2-3 months so they had happy hour specials all day. Very reasonably priced for sushi.

I however can be a bit of sushi snob and didn't order the rolls and went straight for the sashimi bowl that had a couple of different types of sashimi plain. Sashimi is just the raw fish by itself, usually over some daikon root (which is edible and good for you!). Along with the sashimi bowl, I ordered some tea and some miso soup.

The soup came first and it was delicious. Not too salty. The pieces of tofu could have been a little bigger, but there were plenty of them.

The tea came shortly after and it was piping hot. I know I know. Who orders hot soup and hot tea when it's 100 degrees out. Well, they had the AC going strong and for me, sushi is always weird if I don't have tea and miso soup.

The tea was delicious. It was definitely something not out of some random lipton's tea bag, but it it was loose herbs that were being steeped in a steel bowl on top of the tea kettle that came out.

Then the sashimi bowl came out. I was a little anxious because I was concerned about the quality of the fish. Like I said, I live in the SF bay area where there are lots of good quality sushi houses and I guess I've been a bit spoiled. But, Sushi Catcher totally exceeded my expectations. Along with the sashimi bowl, I also got a bowl of sushi rice and also some real wasabi (with the chives and stuff).

Salmon: very delicious
Yellow tail: delicious
Octopus: delicious
white fish: delicious
shrimp: average
tuna: below average
Sushi rice: delicious (it's surprisingly difficult to have good sushi rice)

I actually loved the salmon so much, I ordered an additional bowl of salmon sashimi.

I took my time eating my meal since I really didn't have much planned for the evening. Other diners drifted in and I continued to watch the basketball game, chat with hostess when she wasn't busy with the other customers, and slowly drank my tea.

I enjoyed the tea so much, I asked her to refill the kettle with hot water so I can enjoy the last dredges of the herbs she placed inside. She gladly did this for me.

Of course, went to the bathroom because of all the tea. Bathroom is located in the back and it was standard. Clean though, but nothing hugely impressive.

So, after relaxing for I think a total of two hours, I decided I finally had to pay the bill. With the amount of sashimi I ate, I was definitely expecting something expensive, but it was pretty cheap, at least by sushi standards. So I just tacked what I thought I should have paid and gave them a huge tip since they were so helpful and welcoming and answered so many of my questions about living in the area.

I will be back in the fall when my program starts and I definitely foresee myself coming here as often as I can afford to gorge on salmon sashimi."
Wpd_2mn5d792KgPZUOOMHQ,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,4,"Came here on a Saturday night at around 11:30 pm with small group of 4. Fortunately, my friend got us on the guest list so we got to wait in the shorter line on the right side of the entrance. There was a cover of $10 for guys and ladies were free I believe.

There is a dress code. So for guys, I would say a MINIMUM is a nice pair of jeans, non-tennis shoes, and collared shirt. I did see some guys suited up, so if that's your style you won't be too left out. Most of the ladies I saw inside were dressed pretty well with short, sexy dresses and heels.

Once we got inside, it was pretty packed. Still got a drink (a bit overpriced) in a reasonable amount of time though. The DJ was really good and played a mix of EDM and R&B/Hip Hop. I appreciated it. I can only fist pump for so long.

The bathroom is clean and unisex. I was really confused at first when I walked in, but quickly figured it out. The men's urinals is behind a wall so you aren't in full view of the women's side (fortunately or unfortunately? Up to you I guess.)

The outside patio seemed nice, but once I stepped out, I got hit by a wave of smoke from everybody smoking cigarettes and quickly walked back inside.

Left around 1 am, and the place was still pretty packed and lots of people were dancing.

Overall, with the decor, ambiance, crowd, and music, it reminded me of one of the nicer clubs I would see in Vegas or LA. Would go here again. Like other reviewers said though, get your name on some kind of guest list though. The general admissions line is just way too long."
O1iooQB4W8uHKvnyl3ILHw,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,2,"Eh.

I've never been a huge fan of L&L and when I'm back in California I would rather eat at Ohno's or Ohana's. The same can be said with this one. I got a mini chicken-katsu with a taro boba.

I definitely don't recommend the boba at all. I only got it because the boba place across Happy Valley Rd, Urban Boba Tea House, was closed and I was craving some.

The macaroni salad was decent, the rice was too dry, and the katsu sauce was overly sweet. The chicken katsu was breaded and fried ok. The service was friendly though.

Next time however, I'm going to Leo's Island BBQ on Bell."
hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,5,"Great place and I can't wait to go back!

Went here with to celebrate my friend's birthday. We called ahead and they said that they wouldn't take any more reservations for that night, but would take my cell number and give us a call when a table would be ready. The hostess said it would take about 30 minutes, so we took our time relaxing at my friend's apartment and started heading over after about 20 minutes. It worked out great because while we were about to park the car (huge lot with plenty of spaces), we got a call from the restaurant saying our table was ready. I love when timing works out perfectly.

We were seated quickly and our server, Nick, came to the table and greeted us. We told him we haven't eaten there before and we asked him for our recommendations. Everything he gave us was spot on!

There weren't many of us and we just wanted to share so this is what we ate. We ordered the poutine with the fried egg and short rib. Got half orders each of the bruschetta with prosciutto, short rib, and beer braised short pork butt. And we also ordered the porco e funghi pizza with additional spicy soppressata. The meal was absolutely delicious. We also got the pumpkin spice cake and the restaurant put a candle on top for my friend to blow out. The restaurant owner even came out to the table and personally greeted us and wished my friend a happy birthday!

The whole experience was simply top notch, from the hostess calling us when the table was ready, to the server having outstanding food recommendations, and to the quality of the food. It is definitely on my list of favorite places to go to and I can't wait to go back."
vE4WR05o_c0pL_l4Aq2BlQ,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,5,"Let me first say, if your idea of good pizza includes going to pizza hut, little caesar's, or baking something that was frozen from the grocery store, this place is probably not for you. You're probably better off going across the street to Zipps for their happy hour pizza slices for less than $2. If on the other hand, you are willing to pay for a quality meal filled with a top notch ingredients and a bunch of flavor, then go here.

I came here alone for a late lunch, around 1:30ish pm, and there was a very a light crowd. I was immediately seated, given some water, and a menu by my friendly waiter, Mike. I had already looked through the menu online before coming, so I knew what I wanted. I ordered a glass of their Cabernet and their Principe pizza. The pizza is a thin crust, Neapolitan pizza. It had prosciutto, fresh arugula, and shaved parmigiano reggiano. It was absolutely delicious. The pizza and the wine tasted great together. I would love eating this pizza every week. I am still debating whether or not I like this pizza better than the one at Pizzeria Bianco.

The pizza is quite large and would definitely need 2 people to finish it. I had a very long lunch though, so I slowly worked on it for about 45 minutes while doing some work on my phone. I was never rushed and my waiter was attentive to me the entire time. He actually also gave me some spicy olive oil to try on my pizza. I added a few drops, and it definitely brought out some more kick and flavor to the pizza. I would recommend not adding too much though otherwise you'll drown out the original flavors of the pizza.

Some people complain about the price, but to me, I will always be willing to pay extra for good quality food. Period. The prices for their food are on their website, so don't whine about paying too much. I am just super thankful that this place opened up near where I live. I will definitely be back again to try out the rest of their wonderful menu."

Most of the food is cooked already, so all you have to do is point at what you want. It's like going to Pilipino family party except you have to pay to eat. :(

I only went here for brunch, so far, and got some tapsilog. Basically, some garlic fried rice, beef, and a fried egg. I definitely had flashbacks to my childhood. The nostalgia is probably why I enjoyed it so much, but if I'm brutally honest, the food is just ok. I will be back though to try the rest of the main dishes."

Unfortunately, I can't recommend any of the names of the dishes because I don't know them! :( Well besides the general dumplings and steamed buns. There was this super delicious eggplant one though!

After eating for a little under an hour, our final damage ended up being about $10 per person. I was completely full and will definitely come back again!

I got the #20, a delicious turkey, bacon, avocado, tomato, and cheese concoction alongside the garbanzo bean salad.

Service was friendly and efficient. You just walk up to the register and order, and when your order is done, they will bring it out to your table.

They have water cups out in the table area and also a public sink where you can wash up without having to go to the bathroom.

Parking lot is a little small, but manageable. They have indoor and outdoor seating."
G9m4TMsKGnWbDavqlg6NXg,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,2,"Was searching for a new restaurant and decided to try this place out. Not my best decision.

They have a pretty limited menu. I ended up ordering a small Oahu bowl. It's supposed to be chicken breast with their teriyaki sauce. I substituted the rice that it normally comes with for vegetables.

The bowl I got was vegetables with cubed pieces of check on top. Unfortunately, it was absolutely drenched with sauce. Like swimming in sauce. I was even given an extra container container of sauce in case I wanted to put more. Maybe they forgot that there was no rice to absorb some of the sauce, but it was just way too much.

Also, if the sauce was super good, I probably wouldn't have minded, but the sauce was average, at best, and wasn't really unique. I know there's only so many ways to prepare teriyaki sauce, but this felt like it was a recipe pulled off the internet instead of someone's unique creation.

The staff was friendly though (hence the 2 stars), but I doubt I will go back there."
cXgXRqB40CGHEMKQgxLDTg,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,2,"I really wanted to like this place, but it just fell short.

As other people have described, it's basically made to order wood fired personal pizzas. For my pizza, I got tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, capicola, tomatoes, and basil.

The overall taste was just underwhelming. The sauce and the pizza dough were under seasoned and the ingredients were just not that fresh or of high quality. If you're going to have a personalized pizza business like this where you can add a variety of toppings, the owner/chefs should work on perfecting the sauces and the dough so that the pizza has a good base of flavors. I doubt I will go here again. You're better off going south to Phoenix and getting some pizza from Nook or Pizzeria Bianco.

I'm only giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 because the service was efficient and friendly."
8Y5p2IQMLX6QjGPzxanexg,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,3,"I came here on a Friday night at around 9 pm and was able to find seating pretty quickly.

Ambiance is trendy and fun, but dress is casual. Parking is public in a big lot.

My friend and I ordered a limited combo special where we got to pick one meat plate and one sushi roll.

We ended up ordering 2 combos and got the Galbi and the Daeji Bulgogi for our meats and got the ""Ohya I forgot"" roll and the Dynamite roll.

First, the meats were great. Very comparable to some Korean places in K-town of LA. I would definitely go back there for that. You have the option of cooking the meat yourself or having the kitchen cook it for you in the back. If you don't know how to BBQ well, then I definitely recommend you let the kitchen staff cook it for you. The traditional small plates that go with the BBQ were good too.

Unfortunately, the sushi fell really flat. That's really why I'm not rating this 4 stars! The ""Ohya I forgot"" roll was way too big and the sauce they used on top was too sweet. They also put a lot of the sauce. For the Dynamite roll, the scallops were cooked ok, but they again put way too much sauce. I would recommend asking if they can put the sauce on the side so you can control how much you want to put on it.

So, I will definitely come here for the BBQ and not for the sushi."
t53w4JlkxTau-G-TzhSWog,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,1,"So bad!

Oh man, I came here with a friend on a Thursday night and I am definitely not coming back.

I'll be the first to admit that sushi in Arizona doesn't really impress me (I'm from California) and this place is added to my list of places to not eat at again.

The sushi going around on the conveyor belt is warm. I got one plate off the belt, didn't like it, and then ordered directly from one of the chefs hoping that it would be better.

I got some maguro nigiri (tuna over some rice) and it was really badly cut and did not taste fresh at all.

I also got some other rolls and pieces of nigiri, and the quality and taste did not impress me. Their Haru Sushi did not taste good and had way too much of the fake crab mix. Almost all of their rolls use that fake crab mix and I hate eating it. I don't know how it first was called a California Roll, but I do my best to never order rolls with it. Give me quality nigiri or sashimi anyday. Sadly, you won't get it.

Save your money and go across the street to In-n-Out."
5P7zzVhWvO8nXGPdy7xqhw,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,5,"It's delicious donuts, what's not to like?! My personal favorite is the classic donut with some chocolate frosting on top. I can eat those all day. Their cake donuts are a bit dense for me, but still delicious. I always come in thinking I'll only buy one or two and then walk out with half a dozen. Whoops..."
AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,3,"There are better pizza places then this. I'd rather go to Pizzeria Bianco, Pomo, or Nook even.

Service was so-so. Understandably, there was a large party also in the restaurant, but besides them, the rest of the room was empty.

The quality wasn't bad, but I think they are missing something in their pizza dough. Some kind of seasoning, a little bit more pepper or salt, something. I doubt I will go back."
cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,4,"Sometimes I like being a lazy eater and Chino Bandido definitely helps.

When you walk in, the menu is on the left and you order from one of the register people. You have the option of really customizing everything so don't get too overwhelmed.

I usually order #1, the carnitas, with jerk fried rice. I then pour two containers of their hot sauce over it. I then mix it all together and I have this delicious combination of spicy pork fried rice. Yum!

This will usually keep me full for almost the whole day.

They also include a very good snicker-doodle cookie with your order that is soft and melts wonderfully in your mouth."
nFVqjh-JCOuV2Uci1ZfJ_Q,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,4,"Been living here in AZ for year and I pretty much come here about once a week. I love this place!

I usually order the same thing, a mini-chicken katsu with extra vegetables instead of rice, so I can't attest much of the other items on their menu.

The macaroni salad is fresh, the vegetables steamed, the katsu sauce a good blend of sweet and spice, and the chicken katsu fried to crispy perfection.

I also usually call my order ahead and pick it up. Saves a lot of time. I swear they either recognize my phone number or my voice because they never ask me for my name anymore. As soon as I walk in, they never ask me what I ordered either and I just hand over my credit card while they hand me a bag of my food. If you don't call ahead, depending on what you order and how many people are there, it can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes for your food to come out.

The staff here is super friendly and nice. The older woman behind the counter always has a smile on her face whenever I see here and wishes me a good day.

On top of that, it's a local business (I believe) and I much prefer supporting small business instead of some huge fast food chain."
Ly2ShApiomYZwKehwb7eRA,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,5,"This place is pretty much the only sushi restaurant I will go to in the Phoenix area. It's authentic and the quality of the fish is just amazing. It literally just melts in my mouth.

I've gone alone here to eat some lunch and got immediately sat at the bar. The service is quick and friendly. I just love watching the sushi chefs cut up all the different slices of fish. The lunch sushi combo is very generous and fills me up. I usually also order some steaming hot green tea. Whenever I close my eyes, I sip some tea, and let the Japanese that the staff are speaking to each other just wash over me. I can forget for just a moment that I'm living in the desert and I'm transported back to when I visited Japan.

If I could afford it, and if I didn't live too far, I would eat here as much as I could."
cw0wVQxImxix2GoChgIYNQ,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,2,"Went here on a Saturday evening with some friends and I won't be going back. Basically, you get what you pay for. It's a cheap buffet with cheap food.

The seafood is overcooked.
Don't even think about getting the sushi. I tried one piece and could immediately tell that it was very bad quality fish.
The fried food is over-breaded.
The food with sauces (like the orange chicken) is drenched with sauce.
The vegetables are over-steamed.

They do have Mongolian BBQ which I liked because I got to control how much vegetables/meat/noodles/sauce went into the dish. However, the meat is not good quality and the sauce is diluted so use plenty of both.

The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 star is because the service was top notch and very friendly."
2Gh1Etnpn_BDy72hOXmCtg,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,5,"This is my go to restaurant in Arizona for Vietnamese food! As a normal resident of northern California, I've eaten at my fair share of Vietnamese Restaurants around the bay and this place is definitely comparable! It seems like a locally owned family restaurant because I normally see the same servers there whenever I go. They actually even speak Vietnamese so you know you're probably going to eat somewhere a little bit more authentic.

Their pho and broth is delicious, but I usually get a vermicelli noodle dish, #98, Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. I still don't know how to pronounce it properly, but I know how to eat it! It's basically the rice noodles with some vegetables, grilled pork, and an egg roll on top. They give you a small bowl of fish sauce (or patis to my fellow Pilipinos) and I usually just dump the whole bowl on top. Mix it all together and prepare for a savory meal!

It's located in the back corner of a strip mall area by a small hardware store and has public parking. They also have TVs in the corners and usually have some game playing."
j5-MsggZKYVxpa7hrg7AOQ,rDOCHc5FWf9e8D0loOmNig,4,"Great local chain of restaurants!

Came here on a Sunday afternoon to do some work. They have free WiFi by the way with plugs at each of the booths.

Wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the Turkey Waldorf full salad. It was completely delicious and very filling. It had turkey, apples, grapes, carrots, onions, pecans, and cranberries. Also came with a balsamic vinaigrette. They were a little too generous with the vinaigrette so I will probably ask it on the side next time. Also came with two freshly baked pieces of bread that were very soft and warm and delicious with some butter.

Once you order at the register, you just sit down and someone will bring the food to you. Also, once you're done, someone will come and take your plates away.

Service was friendly and the atmosphere was bright and clean. I will wait to give it 5 stars until I try more items on their menu."
TubbskG3TSU9TpgFFH2How,7vrBSFfE77qieoAuEnmQNg,4,"Eaten here many times, just figured I should write a review after eating at another bakery that claims to be ""Paradise"" that shall not be named.  Wink Wink.  They have this crazy concept of ordering your food at a register, paying the cashier, then waiting for your food to be prepared.  Mind Blown!  The only thing that bums me out is that sometimes they have the Cuban sandwich and other times they don't.  If it's on the menu it's the only thing I will order, if it's not it isn't the end of the world.  They have a wide variety of interesting sandwiches and standard soups that are done very well.  Plus they always have The Arizona Republic available to read!"
rNKaormrHcdJhA_HDmUe6A,7vrBSFfE77qieoAuEnmQNg,4,"Probably go to this location, or the one at Arrowhead, once a month.  Very much a fan and rarely disappointed with each visit.  They usually have coupons online and they take them from your smartphone!  The only gripe I have is that their bananas at breakfast are usually still a little too green to be tasty.  Although the donut muffins make up for it!  Recommended for all meals, but lunch and dinner are usually a little better.  Screw Flanders."
A77k7_xUSDW0QKmahHKLag,7vrBSFfE77qieoAuEnmQNg,3,"Try and catch the early bird special if you go.  For 8.95 you get a very good size salad, a (depending on what you get) big portion of whatever meat you decide on, two sides, and a dessert.  Now the reason for only three stars is me regretting my choice...  I know that isn't fair to the restaurant but usually when you order country fried chicken or a chicken fried steak it's pretty massive.  Mine was the smallest out of everyone else at the tables, and there were 8 of us.  While the chicken was good and I really liked the gravy I was still a little hungry at the end.  And key lime pie is not my idea of dessert.  So I guess I just happened to hit a bad day.  Maybe next time I go they'll have chocolate pie, or something not key lime (My grandparents liked it, but I just couldn't eat it, so sour!).  From the looks of the other plates, the salmon was the winner."

The real star of the buffet though (besides the neon sign above the entrance to the bathroom that reads ""resteroom"") is the Hibachi grill.  Nice fresh vegetables and a good assortment of meats, good teriyaki and garlic sauce, and a nice talkative guy behind the glass making it all for you!  Hooray!"

Once the food arrived, after a considerable wait and empty water glasses, I instantly regretted my decision.  The onion rings were those skinny little fried, non-onion, onion rings that seem to be showing up everywhere lately.  While they are all fine and good on a burger, as a side they are a major disappointment.  The burger was pretty much a McBurger with a bigger bun.  I could have handled the average food if the service wasn't so lackluster.  Go for the golf, don't stay for the food."

Not a good move.  I'm pretty sure they had frog legs too.  So if you're looking for some extra adventurous food, that's been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile you should check this place out.  The Chinese food stand-bys are all represented and aren't bad, didn't try the sushi either but it looked about like what it was supposed to.  Good service and decent food.  A-OK in my book."

I got some Leninade soda and it was delicious!  The wife got a grape soda that made you forget about any other grape soda you've ever had.  The food is great too.  I had the Santa Fe burger and it had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting (it had to be the pickles!) , and a very nice bun that absorbed everything the burger was throwing at it, and it was a lot (Good house sauce!).

We had the firecracker shrimp appetizer which we thought was very good, we ate all of it including the lettuce that was underneath, just to get some more of the spicy wing style sauce.  We shared a spring roll, I forget which one, it had imitation crab, some noodles, lettuce and something else?  My girlfriend really liked it, it was just a little too much (not meat and cheese) for my liking, I will say it tasted very fresh, just not my thing.  For the entree she had the beef pho soup and really enjoyed the hell out of it.  I had the (I think it was called) Shaking Beef?

With my bank being uncooperative and me having to leave to go to the bank to actually pull out money to pay for my lunch, I was extremely frustrated. As I was walking out the staff stopped me and offered me my lunch for free simply because I was having so much trouble with my bank and they felt bad for me. That right there made my day and made me a fan of Manuel's. It's not many places that would take a loss on their end just to make things easier for the customer.

Our drinks were never once empty, nor did a dirty dish sit on our table for very long before someone swooped in and took care of us. I loved the setup of the restaurant. Not too cluttered or bright. Outdoor seating available as well.
Food. We ordered the street corn app for hh, which was just average. I had the relleno plate with rice and borracho beans. While the pepper was not cooked completely in the top thicker part, I was already too full to eat it because the rice and beans were so good I had them first :) the sauce on the relleno was simple yet flavorful and savory.
Would like to try the bean dip app, as another review recommended it.
I saw an order of shrimp cocktail go to another table and I was glad I didn't order. They serve it with saltines?
tip- if you like margaritas, go during happy hour because they are served in small mason jar looking glasses. I would guess 6oz of drink plus ice in there.
I'm rating 4/5 because I didn't actually try some things just made observations and I did appreciate the fast and wonderful service here.
O and you get free chips and salsa, which is exactly like some burros-spicy!
I would recommend."
mtQ7Uc-j2muK0AyVQTT9fQ,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,2,"Okay. I guess I am the minority in this opinion, but I did not find the food at Ibby's to be exceptional by any means. We ordered the catfish filet, catfish strips, and fried chicken. Sides were macaroni and cheese, potato salad, and fries.
The catfish was majorly overcooked. DRY and disappointing. That was a huge surprise. I realize we are in Arizona so my expectations are adjusted here, taking that into account.
I did not try the chicken as it did not look appetizing at all. My husband agreed that Popeye's or Church's does a better job there.
The ""potato"" salad was mostly egg, lacking any seasoning or flavor. It reminded me of the containers of egg salad you get at Fry's. Nothing special. The fries, which ""came with"" the catfish and chicken, were bland and generic. I would have preferred to sub these for something else or leave them out entirely.
One item worth noting is the macaroni and cheese. This was the best part of the meal to be honest. Creamy, yet cheesy on top and the pasta was cooked just right. This should be a main dish!
The cornbread served with the order was stale, dry and unappetizing. Also included were PACKETS of tartar sauce (?!?!?). What...? Even Pete's makes their own sauce. This was very disappointing. The hushpuppies did taste fresh, but for the most part, were lacking seasoning and texture.
Hot sauce is provided, in small plastic containers. This helped with the flavor but luckily, I had some malt vinegar in the cabinet to help.
I do not want to hurt this small business with this review. Actually, my intent is to give feedback so that they can improve and succeed. Having soul food is a rare treat for us, as it is usually unhealthy so on this occasion we decided to give Ibby's a try. I hope they can fix these issues because I would like to see this small business succeed. Good luck!"

hmltG5aNY43I0NVMGTmPHw,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"This is my new favorite Greek place in Chandler  (MedFresh #1 in Tempe). I have tried the chicken shawarma plate several times, and every time it's been consistently delicious. I also love the falafal. I've tried falafal before that was dry, overcooked, bland. Their version is moist and flavorful! The best part is the sauces. One sauce for the falafal, one AMAZING garlic sauce for the shawarma chicken. So good! The rice is always on point as well. I have 4 stars because the service always seems to be ""cranky"" or bored/annoyed. Better customer service would make this place perfect IMO. Please support this local business!"
Jzth-y32SyvOhJNgbIPTqQ,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Loved my lunch veggie plate. All of the ingredients had their own flavor and texture, although some people may not like having everything piled on top of each other in the bowl. Doesn't bother me!
Hummus was very delicious. Different than others around. I need to get more so I can put my finger on it. The jalapeno hummus was actually spicy which I've never had before. Other places just don't add enough I guess lol
The eggplant was tough and tasted like it was out for awhile so I'll probably skip that next time (I came in at noon so not sure why so stale? ). The pita was very elastic and glutenous which I did not care for but it's not important for a plate. Didn't need it but I would've loved a more bready pita that's just my taste though.
space is small and parking limited so plan accordingly.  Employees were efficient and friendly. Can't wait to go back!"
wS6LB0lSt0orSxP8cYXzvA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,5,"Best wings we've ever had. They have an extensive menu including baked brie app, salads, veggie Philly and many other interesting choices. Service is always good. Bartender will suggest drinks if you ask and there is a patio outside as well.
I like that the noise level is pretty low most of the time, despite it being a sports bar. There are televisions to watch your game and it's laid back. You seat yourself. Overall, great find that's on our favorites list.
my one and only suggestion: ranch is always runny. Please fix the recipe. I love ranch with my wings :)"
0vdw9E5zzYDNsW_smjBmHA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,5,Best vegetarian burrito I've ever had! Beans are so delicious. The chips and salsa are worth the trip alone.
Jd2NUZeVeyWi1tTNKXMt1Q,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,3,"Unfortunately I have to downgrade si Senor. The past 3 or 4 times ordering from there, they have either refused, or given pushback when we ask for vegetarian tacos (beans instead of meat). I don't understand why they make such a big deal out of this substitution?
If they offered calabacitas (grilled vegetables) this would improve the menu for me. For now, we'll be thinking twice about ordering from here knowing they are going to hassle us for making substitutions :("
GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,5,"Just went for lunch yesterday. Haven't been here in awhile and they have definitely stepped up their game. They now offer all you can eat sushi for $18 and have more help in the kitchen keeping the conveyor belt replenished. We went at 1230 so it was the perfect time to go. The waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full. They also have an extensive menu to order from, if you don't want conveyor belt sushi. On top of all of that, they give you a stamp card for free sushi. I love this place because you can get literally three times the selection for the same price. Meaning, you can try three times more rolls because they are served in smaller portions and you can get lots of different flavors/choices for the same price as you would spend elsewhere. Love it! Please support local businesses :)"
UXDoc76N59G6p3RUH5S--w,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"What can I say that has not already been said? Chase's has great service, good food for a great price and offers a LOT of choices. This is no Denny's or IHOP. The food quality is much better, the inside is much more hip and clean and they even offer homemade desserts at the counter. I like going because I can pick a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Love the variety."
E7C8xUC0oSNOpRl1vMTMzA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Was craving fried plantains and this place hit the spot. I loved the rice and beans they serve. very full of flavor, savory and fresh. I'm not a huge meat eater but my husband loved the pork. I wish there were some veggie options but for now I will keep coming back for the flavorful dishes available. I appreciate the seasoning and cooking that goes into the ""side"" dishes and for me they make an amazing meal!"
dNr7VKRti8dXWE-jzfVBtQ,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,2,"So.. where to start. First time here we brought my sister who was visiting. We were not able to sit outside although there were many tables open. Hostess said we could sit upstairs at the bar. We get up there and actual bar is full and everywhere else you could sit is for lounging, no tables to eat at. Back downstairs.
We were sat in a corner by the indoor bar downstairs, behind a door. At a table that wobbled. That did not deter us. Rather, it was the fact that the entire bar area seemed to only have one server handling tables. Sigh.
Our server was amazing. We watched him juggle a dozen tables and he was very helpful and friendly in spite of this. The two stars are for him. Otherwise this review would be zero stars.
I ordered the tamale breakfast, which took about 30-40 min to arrive. Okay, it's busy. The issue is that what they are calling a ""tamale"" is just a flat square of masa,  layered with meat of your choice, cheese, eggs and sauce. It arrived cold for whatever reason. Gross.
No one seemed to be helping our server so we waited each time we needed something (refill, check, to go box, etc). And waited. The rating here is for the food, wait, and lack of organization. Needs more staff, more seating with tables if you're going to open the upstairs bar for brunch.
loved the beautiful birds but will probably not be back to dine in. My sister liked her ""brizza"" aka breakfast pizza so we may try the pizza to go and give it another go."
64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"I'm not even sure why I'm writing a review since the amazingness of this place is not in question buuuut...

Holy crap.

Bloody Mary's are outstanding.
Guacamole is so tasty.

The fish torta is maybe the best sandwich in the valley. Fresh, amazing flavors.. Even the bread is vibrant and yummy.

Who's hungry??"
ROMFVEFKEYi7qhyITX6jfA,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,1,"No. No no no.

It's places like this that give veganism, vegetarianism, and frankly vegetables, a bad name.

We went here for Mother's Day and boy was it a mistake.

We ordered the hummus to start which had about 1.5 tablespoons which wasn't even enough to dip all the vegetables we were given. Also it wasn't good. I had the BLT which was bland and had a weird taste. I also ordered the apple soyrizo hash which had no soyrizo in it and when I asked I was told it's just the flavor. Well then don't put that in the name of the item and also then where is the flavor coming from??

My brother had the avocado quinoa bowl and it was tasteless and missing items like black beans and my mom had the blueberry French toast... The toast was literally just toasted and there were barely any toppings, in fact she had to ask for more to make it edible. Also the free mom-mosa that was to come for my mom took 45 mins: ridiculous.

Apparently the smoothies are good so my recommendation is - make it a smoothie bar... Smoothies, coffees, dessert.. That'd be great.  But don't do food. I cook vegan food and it can be delicious. This was not that. And it was way overpriced for what it was.

Someone did come over to ask us how it was and when we told her she offered to refund us, which we declined, or give us a gift certificate which we did accept.. But that's always like cool your food was bleh gimme more! We may return to try something else but well see. Not in a rush.

We got Baskin Robbins after. Can't go wrong there."
Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"Long time favorite of my family's.  Go there for all special occasions.  The croissants.... oh the croissants.....

Everything is delicious, but I LOVE the black bean soup.  Before I became a vegetarian I always used to get the grilled rack of lamb...  My brother loves egg in a hole.....the corn ravioli is to die for.  Basically, you can't go wrong.  And Vincent, the chef- is a gem."
9kjk05G50XWnmJQBz_wcnw,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"Delicious, unique, great location, vegetarian options, affordable. What more do you want?

You get to pick the broth you want and they do have a vegetarian broth. Then there are a variety of vegetables, noodles, egg, tofu.. etc. You get to pick the ingredients you want and the spice level. It was hot and flavorful and satisfying.  I will definitely be going back.

Service was good and owner came over to speak with us - very enthusiastic about the business and upcoming additions to the menu."
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,4,"Wonderful to have a place with a real vegetarian menu and tasty options.

Chili fries?  Amazing.
Noodle bowls?  Delicious.
Soy ice cream?  YUM.

And, it's pretty inexpensive, considering.  You can for sure eat for under $10.

Thumbs up from me!"
qMJyOW1FdPOf8sli8DIq_A,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"So glad to have this new little gem on mill ave. We need more local places like this!

Essence is always my go-to for croissants. But Essence is also closed on Sundays so Delice is a great addition to the area. Chocolate was delicious as was the croissant. Will definitely be going back."
MbAsfN3wwV22K7GZsgcBqA,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"I don't get why this place has only 3.5 stars, the food is awesome, the ambiance is really nice and relaxed, and the prices are reasonable.

The guacamole is so delicious with a sweet sauce on the side... I also had the fish tacos and the veggie burrito (I shared both don't judge me) and both were very delicious - fresh ingredients, not processed, yummy.

And the patio area is really lovely. Thumbs up all around."
L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,4,"On recommendation of a friend I went to Miele's for the first time tonight.  I was pleasantly surprised.

I had spinach ravioli with pesto sauce, my parent's had orange roughy with spaghetti and a special with penne in a brandy sauce with smoked salmon.

The food was tasty and came in good portions (but not TOO much which is starting to really be a pet peeve of mine).  The service was excellent; friendly, fast, and accommodating.

My one annoyance stems from the fact that they added $2 to our bill because I requested pesto sauce on my ravioli (rather than I guess what would normally come - marinara?).  Thing is, the server didn't say that there was an additional cost when I requested pesto and the $2 on the bill was simply labeled, ""misc.""  I think that is kind of bad business and it was reflected in the tip we gave.

Nevertheless, I will go back.  It's nice to have a good local non-chain neighborhood Italian place nearby."

eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"What can a say - Barrio is a winner.

The fish tacos, of which I am most certainly a conusieeur - are the best I've ever had.

The guacamole is fresh and delicious, the sangria is so favorful.

The best part of the place is the ambiance, the feel, the live music on Saturday night, the artwork inside and out.  There are awesome murals in the back parking lot area - great for photo ops.

True Arizona, great quality."
8B1TIuaqhaZ7QMEhDUu-Gg,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"MY DREAM PLACE - healthy fast food!  I tried the Scottsdale location on Saturday for the first time - had the Protein Burger, Early Bird style, and it was so delicious.  Also had the dirty chai (has a shot of espresso) - so good.

Today I had the Signature Tuna Sandwich from the Tempe location, and thought it was excellent.  Everything tastes so fresh and has such distinct yummy flavors.

I saw the Tempe location didn't have many reviews and a lower rating so I wanted to try it out for myself.  I thought the food was just as good, and as I live in Tempe, I will be frequenting that location.

The drive-thrus seem kind of slow and ridiculous, but eh, that's ok -- worth it!"
fSBhe0A6Dfa8JCYccfpMog,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"Like whoa.  Best bagels in Arizona.  No question.

Bagels are probably my favorite food.  I take them very seriously.  But I don't eat them very often because most bagels in the Phoenix area are so mediocre it's just not worth it.

Bagel Man bagels are incredible.  We went there on Saturday to pick up a dozen and the everything bagels had just come out of the oven.  OMG.  Fresh, piping hot, soft, flavorful - PERFECT.  And the veggie cream cheese is also amazing.

I wish we lived closer but then I might eat 5 bagels a day.  Maybe it's good we're a few miles away.

Can't wait to go back.  Oh and I love The Bagel Man himself - he's legit."

The food is authentic, the flavors are delicious... Everything I've tried is fresh and tasty.

Eggplant, gai lan, fried fish, fish soup, green beans, scallion pancakes, vegetable lo mean, mapo tofu... All delicious.

And they deliver!"
nfdNvM0HFCDmnJ5eHMnuNg,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"We came here so my fiancé could have his fill of deli meat... I ended up having a bunch of sides and they were all crazy good. The Mac n cheese was insane. The cole slaw and potato salad were delicious. The French fries were crisp and though needing a little salt - were perfect when dipped in ketchup. I  tried a bite of the onion roll on my fiancé's sandwich and it was so delish.

Even as a vegetarian I would come back again to try other things.

Also the service was incredibly fast despite the place being packed and all the food was fresh and hot.

Plus it's right next to Last Chance. Double win."

I grew up in Tempe and have been going to Restaurant Mexico for as long as I can remember, at all of its various locations over the years.  It is, without question, my favorite restaurant in Arizona, and the best Mexican food out there.

The wait staff is so nice and has worked there forever.  The food comes out super fast and is always hot.  And most importantly - DELICIOUS.  Their enchiladas are amazing - with queso fresco (not gross yellow cheese) and green tomatillo sauce... oh man.  So good.

Now that they're back on Mill, the location is great.  I can't recommend this place enough.   Go, you won't regret it!!!"

Had the eggplant parm sandwich - (half - it was a HUGE half), and it was SO delicious.  The cheese was melted just perfectly.

My boyfriend had the Il Purista - w/o the meat since I'm a vegetarian so we could share - so fresh and so tasty.

We also shared the artichoke salad, and gorgonzola stuffed green olives. .... Amazing.

I can't wait to go back - like, maybe for a second lunch in 30 minutes."
TkgEHV_4Qmamb_wUvkgdTg,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"Walked here from our place - great location. Great service, no wait.

Had the buttermilk pancakes with over medium eggs - pancakes were just the right flavor and fluffiness and the eggs were done perfectly. My fiancé had the chicken fried chicken and I tried his hash browns (delish) and biscuits (so yummy). The biscuits came with a strawberry jam that tasted homemade and like my grandma used to make. I actually put some of that on my pancakes and it was SO GOOD.

They also gave us chocolate covered strawberries as a nice little extra treat.

Will definitely come back."
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,4,"My comments go as follows:

1.  Say, WHAT?  Mexican food and Chinese?

2. It's not really Mexican, nor Chinese.  It's its own thing.  Don't expect anything in particular.

3.  It's unique and good.  The black beans are DELISH.

4.  As a vegetarian, there aren't so many options - there is the veggie egg foo young (which is good) and the veggie salad (which is not).  I end up getting a cheese quessadilla and egg foo young -- all in all, very tasty.

5.  The snickerdoodle may be the best part."

You really just can't go wrong."
gPc4tXMS_wt4g2yVUmco8w,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"Wonderful.

I was a fan of Mucho Gusto even though the food was never amazing.  It was just a fun place and great location.  Now, it's even better.

We started with the Sweet Potato Croquettes which were insanely good.  Hot, sweet, tasty - so good.  My Mom had the black bean soup to start which I tasted and was delicious.  So much flavor.

For entrées my Dad had the salmon which he said was delicious.  My Mom had I both had the Gypsy salad which is: Seared halloumi with spring mix, mascerated figs, bleu cheese, candied pecans, red onion, bulgur wheat, fried chickpea and balsamic vinaigrette. It.was.so.grood.  Sweet and spicy and the bleu cheese was amazing as was the halloumi and everything just tasted delicious.

My Dad (of course) ordered the strawberry shortcake bread pudding (I MEAN SHUT UP) for dessert and I had one bite only (I was really proud of myself) and it was insanely delicious.

I am SO excited this place is in Tempe now and can't wait to go back!"

Are you that kind of person that doesn't like just one thing on your plate - but likes to sample many things and take a bite of each thing over and over going round the plate til you're done?

ME TOO.

Gadzooks is a dream for you and I! So many inside filling choices, so many topping choices, so many salsa choices... I basically tried everything and it was all amazing, and there are lots of veg friendly options including an outstanding corn bread filling that sounds weird but is so creamy and tasty you'll go nuts. And the tortillas are awesome which is a necessity.

I pretty much want to order another round and just spend the day here. Don't judge me you'd want to, too, if you were here."
dA7ORbBrCdxoMlvn3I6JDA,ly4XAav9mrawBs0oTXu0Ag,5,"Shimogamo ruined my life.

Why 5 stars you ask?

I can no longer eat sushi anywhere else.

Best sushi I've had anywhere.  And in Arizona no less!  The fish is so fresh - I usually prefer it on its own, not in a roll.  I feel like usually I order rolls because the fish isn't so great so I'd like some mayo concoction to hide the taste of the fish.  Not so here.

Escolar is the best.  Salmon is incredible.  Tuna - yum.  You can't go wrong.  There's a poke appetizer that they sometimes have that is outstanding.

Ambiance is pleasant, staff is nice, but the fish... oh the fish.  Any time I want sushi and I consider another place, I'm like, why?  Who are we kidding let's just go to Shimogamo.  Go - you won't regret it."

The wine list is very good, moderately priced.  There is a very good sauvignon blanc from France for $5/glass, a great way to start the meal.  My wife had the french fries - excellent.  I had the skewer special of the day - shrimp and chorizo.  That was super and a large portion.  The main course was the quiche of the day - duck breast and bacon - wow!  Desert was also special - the chocolate souffle is incredibly rich and the creme brulee was excellent.  The best french food we have had here, very much like a french cafe in France.  Our total - with 4 glasses of wine, two appetizers, one main dish and two desserts was $80 before tip.  The service was wonderful."

The general Tso's chicken is very good in quality, but lacks flavor.  The moo shu pork is still very good and the hot and sour soup is still very good."

I can tolerate some heat, but if a medium is too hot for me to eat, that is bad.  If you like hot food you probably will like the food.  Quality and flavor were otherwise good.  The portions were generous.  My wife got chicken tikka marsala, extra mild, she could not eat it but it was fine for me - good flavor.  Samosas were good, nice cardamom and cumin flavor.

No ambiance. now this normally does not bother me, in fact my idea of a good ethnic restaurant is great food and no ambiance.  However, minimal or no air conditioning would have made eating there unpleasant.  Try take out."

Really good food - full of flavor.  The special seafood dish was full of fresh seafood and had a sauce with lots of citrus notes.  The people running this are very friendly.  I got medium heat with some trepidation since I can not eat extemely hot food.  It was just right, spicy but not burning hot.  If you like your food really hot I would get hotter."

chicken pot stickers - good texture and quality but little flavor.  These needed some ginger or shiitake mixed in.

hot and sour soup - not hot or sour.  Good ingredients but very flat. little flavor.

mongolian beef - OK no major complaints but not up to what c fu used to make.

pork fried rice (I asked for bean sprouts with this) - this was the best dish.  very good.

I'll try it again, not bad but not outstanding."

The waiter and the staff are outstanding.  They go far out of their way to help you if you have food problems.  My wife can not eat black pepper.  They have always made sure her food is without it and even the cook double checked every thing she was using.  I have not had that kind of service for a long time.

It does not look prepossessing when you walk in, but once you get back to the dining area it is very nice.  It is quiet and very comfortable."
tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA,8sd-dwLPpL-qgcACE-ErIA,5,"It is the best Indian food we have had since we got here 15 years ago.  We went for the lunch buffet on Sunday.  Lots of variety and not cheap dishes, they had two lamb dishes which were excellant. The sauces all had good flavor.  Moderately hot although the lamb vindaloo was hotter. Also excellent tandori chicken and daal. The main dishes were a better bet than the appetizers.  My wife does not tolerate chili heat so she got the chicken tikka masala very very mild and it was great.  Lots of flavor but mild enough for her to eat.  So if you have some one who does not tolerate hot foods this restaurant can accommodate them, a rare thing in Indian restaurants.  We both left stuffed, my wife took home half her dish home although she did have pouri.  the rice pudding at the end was excellent, the raita was also excellent.  The tab for two of us was $27, a real bargain for this quality of food."
IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA,8sd-dwLPpL-qgcACE-ErIA,5,"Of all the middle eastern restaurants we have tried this is the best.  The flavors of the food were great.  The meat and chicken were very high quality.  Try the special rice (polo) dishes, especially the one with barberries.  My favorite was the lamb kabobs.  If you get a plate with rice and salad (you can get all rice but it would be a lot of rice) ask for the salad on a separate plate.  It is a very good salad with excellent quality greens and an Italian type of dressing.
The Persian ice cream was great.  Baklava is different from other versions but really good.  The eggplant appetizer was also very good.
This is clearly a family run place and this is a very welcoming and gracious family.  Service was wonderful.  We had a great experience."
16d3BlncEyCTzb0GxXrBXQ,8sd-dwLPpL-qgcACE-ErIA,5,"As good as it gets?  You bet!  This is the best mediterranean food I have had here.  In fact it was about the best meal we have had in years.  It is not fancy, it is ethnic but everything is super.  Even the salad was made with care - very fresh romaine, light dressing, real Kalamata olives.

I had the gyros plate.  They let me sub Baba ganoosh for the rice (I figured with pitas I did not need another starch - until I tasted my wife's rice, so good)  This rice is not the run of the mill yellow rice you usually get.  It is distinctly flavored with spices (some what like garam masala).  Gyros was of great quality, loaded with flavor and very tender.  A lot of it too.  Portions are very large.  Hummus was great too, lots of flavor.

My wife had the chicken shwarma which I do not usually like - I really liked this.  Like the rest of the food, it is richly flavored and a very large portion. It is made in the traditional way on a vertical spit - you can see it.

The top 10 reasons to go here

1 - great food
2 - large portions of great food.
3 - great service.  They are always helpful and extremely pleasant. They clearly care about how you are doing.
4- nice ambiance - no, not fancy, but restful and quiet, with comfortable seating
5- great hours (open from late morning until late in the evening)
6 - easy and plentiful parking (it is in the strip mall on the north-east corner of Southern and Alma School - near the center)
7 - They just might give you free baklava - I noticed several people commented on this and they did give some to us.  It is great - strong fresh walnut flavor, flaky pastry and a modest amount of honey - not overwhelming as it often is. So tip generously.
8 - clean, and they clear the tables quickly.
9 - an excellent value ($27 for two plates with drink - it is dinner)
10 -go there - we want this place to stay open a long time because we plan on going often!

Now it is my wife's turn -
I had a lot to say until he pinched all my ideas!  On the other hand, he's real picky about his mediterranean/middle eastern food, so the above is actually about a 10-star review.  As for me, I have a lot of food sensitivities, and they were cheerfully willing to accommodate them in every way possible.  The result:  I ate each bite I could squeeze in, and pita-d the plate clean!  And brought home enough for another whole dinner!  What a wonderful change from ""Yeah - sorry - pretty much everything has pepper in it.  Except for the desserts.""

So, outstanding food, value, service, and experience!  Please help them stay in business - you won't regret it a bit!"

SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog,8sd-dwLPpL-qgcACE-ErIA,2,"I really wanted to like this place.  We have been looking for reasonable Italian food not too far from our house.  Unfortunately, in the end we decided we did not like it enough to go back.  We had the take out chicken picata special.  The bread was strange, not bad but not italian and certainly not ciabatta.  I liked the salad alot.  It it an antipasto salad so it has lots of things in it like pepperoncini.  You have to like that type of salad to enjoy this. Canned black olives did not help it. The fetuccini alfredo was terrible.  It tasted strongly like nutmeg.  When I taste something like that it tells me they did not use good enough ingredients to let it stand on its own.  I have had real Alfredo at Alfredos of Rome in Miami Beach.  Whicle I don't expect that quality of food here, the real stuff it very delicate and rich - butter cream and real parmagian cheese, nothing else.  The chicken picata was good as long as you did not expect chicken picata.  It had no lemon in it.  It was a nice dish, breaded chicken with mushrooms, capers, tomatoes etc, but it definely was not chicken picata.  Desert was chocolate haselnut cake.  It probably is very good if you like chocolate and coffee together.  neither of us like this.  So out of every thing we got, the chicken was OK, but not what it was supposed to be and the salad was good for that type of salad."

The asparagus appetizer was great.  The pasta dishes were excellent. The veal dish my wife had was excellent as well.  Very reasonable prices for an Italian restaurant.  Very extensive wine list. This is a great find.

Last time I went there they got my order wrong which is always annoying, but they fixed it. No big deal. I've been here probably half a dozen times, and I'd say it's more like a 3.5 star, but I can't quite justify 4. This definitely a ""throw a lot of things into this sandwich because it might taste better"" kind of place, a la Paradise. I'm a very basic eater, so I don't need 9 ingredients in a sandwich, but whatevs, some people like it."
xIbtbAJLWLNZcqfqF4f-Nw,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"Great GREAT food and wonderful atmosphere.  The bartender Jenna was awesome and fun to chat with.  We split the rare roast beef sandwich and some sort of a pot roast style entree.  Both were insane!

Of course we did the fries which were decadent as can be and split a caramel custard for dessert.  Everything exceeded our expectations.

We'd tried going here once before but it was too crowded.  We like to sit at the bar and you can catch them at a time when there isn't room but that's obviously the sign of a great place.

Wonderful open concept kitchen where you can see them cooking everything and the deck has heaters and a WONDERFUL fireplace.

Love this place.  You will too."
wJYFQrlx-uRmujWM_IDFtw,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"Authentic street signs!  The guys working here seem like tough south side guys which is sort of weird but thats alright. Still... I've got news for ya. The pizza isn't even close. We can say it's the water or whatever but they even call a pizza ""the UNO"" and it's a pizza hut special on a bad day. Not even close.  Skimpy crumbled sausage as opposed to patty and a nothing crust. The advertising might fool ya to come there once thinking it's chi style but you won't come back.

I'm not saying that its the worst pizza ever, because its not.  But it certainly isnt Chicago style and its simply mediocre mid-size crust pizza."
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,3,"OK...so I moved to town about 8 months ago and FINALLY made it to what I had heard was The Holy Grail for pizza.  I was prepared for the wait and arrived a good two hours before I planned on partaking in the feast that I had heard so much about.  I have got to admit, I LOVE the atmosphere and love the beer/wine bar next door as well as the English place across the street.  Its all part of it....and the charm is unlike much of anything that I am accustom to in the Southwest.  I almost felt like I was in New England or even the Carolina's.  It has a wonderful old world charm.

OK.  So its finally time and we get seated at a wonderful and cozy table by an absolutely charming hostess.  Really made me feel special.  We perused the menu and ordered three  that seemed would be a perfect complement to one another and 15 minutes later they arrived.

Ehhh.  So, so.  Fair.  One of them said on the menu that it came with a marinara based sauce had no sauce whatsoever.  At least nothing recognizable.  When we asked if there was any way at all that we could get some sauce on the side (and we knew that Bianco doesnt roll with that) we were politely told that they do not do that BUT they would make us another one if we wished.  I mean that is a wonderful offer...but we couldnt bare to see a decent pizza get wasted.  It just needed a little sauce!  So we told them ""no thanks...it's fine"".

Ingredients are fresh, service great and atmosphere really kinda special but once again, the pizza isnt that out of this world.  But I guess you've got to do it because it is after all ""Pizzeria Bianco"".  And I will be back.  Probably quite a few times.  I loved the experience.  But for a woodfired pizza...with quality without the ego (to not allow a side of sauce to come out) there are a few places I'd pick first.

So long and short (I have to believe) is that you should communicate with the waitstaff as to what you enjoy in a pizza without presuming that it comes with things we take for granted like a good red sauce.  I have a hunch that if you do you are probably guaranteed to enjoy your za when it shows up.

Chow!"
6nKR80xEGHYf2UxAe_Cu_g,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"What a great place.   You don't even need to buy anything to feel good about being here.  Nice people and very interesting selection of local produce, beer, wine, etc...  Great music even!  Everytime I go here the music is wonderful.  Neat Dylan collage in the back too...I heard the story on it.  I think it was the owners album collection or something.

The best part of all however is the BBQ!  Wonderful selection of breakfast stuff and lunch/dinner.  You can buy the brisket, pulled pork etc...by the pound too which would be great to take home one night for dinner.  It is heavenly BBQ.  Really just great.

I feel like I am on vacation everytime I walk in this place and havent been disappointed yet.  Its so nice to see an independently owned gas station with an owner that takes every opportunity to share all of his passions with his patrons.  This is certainly not your ordinary gas station.  They have taken it to a whole new level and I admire anybody who ""re-invents"" something that we all thought that we knew everything there was to know about.  To call this a gas station is like calling Fashion Square a strip mall.  Its so much more and its worth the trip."
Qv0OEziLJwyAqcgtrTsA4w,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,3,"Well...I'll give ya this much.  The beef is good and the fries arent too bad either.  If I were basing my review solely on this, it would be a 4 and a half.  But sadly, this ""One dollar sign"" price logo is incorrect.  If you saw a fast food place that showed two dollar signs you would wonder why, so they surely arent going to let that happen...but this is no cheap lunch, and if overpaying for a beef combo is ""Chicago style"", than I will stop telling people where I am from.

There isnt a person wearing a Bears jersey out there that isnt going to tell you that a beef needs sweet and hot peppers and needs to be extra juicy.  I know people that will laugh at you if you dont do any of these things.  But here, your base lunch sandwich is $6.85!  Then any one of those three things (sweet peppers, hot peppers or au jus) will cost you an extra .65!  So you are looking at over 8 bucks for a standard size beef sandwich before you add on fries and I really dont know anybody who doesnt order fries with their lunch.  By the time I was done with the smallest fries and the smallest drink available, I was staring at a $13 bill for lunch.  If I had brought a date with me I would be looking at a $26, 10 minute lunch.  And my credit card receipt at the counter where I order and go back to get my order when its done shows a line for a tip.  Are you guys nuts?

The place does good business though it seems, so I may be the minority in feeling the pain in the pricing.  Its just that a fellow really should have some idea that this is no cheap lunch before he walks in this place...thats why I am writing this.

If money is no object and you are craving a real Chicago beef...I think you will be happy with Lukes.  But I truly need to draw the line at their ""Chicago style"" mentality when a working class guy in Chicago couldnt afford to come here for lunch.  If you want a suggestion guys...  In Chicago, what I paid for the sandwich (once again, over $8), would have been a combo having a fries and a coke too.  The average Joe cannot drop $13 for an average lunch.  Either change your dollar signs to two $$ or do your best to offer a fair deal to a lunchtime crowd.   At least I wish you would!  It was a good sandwich!  But not a $13 lunch."
P28agvrsm3OARbV3tFQbUg,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"4 words sum it up.  Chicago Style Deep Dish.  This is as close as it gets in this town and you've gotta give them 5 stars for that alone.

I've never understood why nobody does it right out here.  Its not the water no matter what they say.

They don't have sausage patty but the crust is great and the za is super tasty.  If you're done with the artisan style or you just need a good old fashioned ""comfort food meal"" than go with the Chicago style.  It'll do the trick."
cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,4,"OK...I've gotta give it up for G&S.  I finally tried it after I had heard from a few reliable sources that it was the place.  They were sure right.  But before you plan your Saturday night around the place I've gotta be clear that the atmosphere isnt going to blow you away when you walk in the door.  It sits in a strip mall between a pool supply store and a Blockbuster and there isnt any of that fancy new Zen asian stuff going on.  Well...at least not well done.  There are a few tacky fountains and some circa 1985 booths and chairs...but that's not what you're going to be going there for anyway.

So we sit down and and inquire about a Happy Hour.  I guess that they dont do that anymore.  OK.  So our first 5 minutes made us think that maybe we should have done Flo's instead despite the fact that we wanted to finally give this place a try.

So I ordered the Chef Special Noodles as well as the citrus chicken thinking that we've gotta go for the specialties if were going to give this place a one time shot.  Two minutes later our waitress tells me that they are out of the noodles so I am already doubting the recommendation.  So I ordered the beef noodles (chow fun) and sat back and waited.

5 minutes later the food comes out.  That was when I figured out why I had heard such magnificent things about George and Sons.  Wow!  The food was amazing!  The portions were wonderful and despite the fact that it tasted so fantastic I still have leftovers for tomorrow (or maybe when I am done with this review tonight!).  Just wonderful!

It was so fresh and so unique in flavor.  You could tell that their ""citrus sauce"" was the real deal.  It was created there by a cooking genius.  The chow fun was fantastic and although the service was simple...it was wonderful.  No attitude, no ego and very little trendy atmosphere.  Just awesome food in a low key environment.  I will be back!  Oh yeah....I will be back!"

The staff is great and very personalized and have a way of always making you feel special.  The deep wood bar is warm and inviting."
IkLAUX7lZIWqE9_YC66SRw,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,4,"I was so excited to give this place 5 stars but couldn't begin to pull the trigger.  The food is worthy of it, but the service and atmosphere insists that I kick it down a notch.  Sorry!

The pizza was fantastic.  I ordered The Boss and it was huge.  Crust was wonderful and ingredients were abundant and fresh.  It tasted great and the texture was awesome.  Really just a wonderful Za.  We also ordered the pear salad which was fantastic.  We saw other orders coming out and they all looked equally as special.  The slices available for a quick grab and go looked great too.

But the acoustics were horrible.  I couldn't carry on a conversation once a few people got there after their movie got out.  I couldn't even understand the waitress when she was explaining something about the gelato.  She was new, so I don't wanna rattle the cage too much but after our pizza came she was overly occupied with small talk with other tables it seemed.  The place is small, so there can't be more than 20 tables but she seemed a little overwhelmed.  Plus, the tables are way too close.  Another couple came in and sat down next to us and I felt as though I was obligated to have a conversation with them.  That's too close.

Lastly, that darned Western exposure is a killer at dusk and between having the sun glaring in our faces, the couple almost on top of us and the fact that we couldn't hear ourselves over the rest of the noise in the place really undid so much of the quality that we would've enjoyed otherwise.

But if you want a great pizza, I'd have to say that this is on the top of the list.

I hope that they can cozy it up a little bit and put some padding on the ceiling or something.  If I was in a comfy booth facing away from the sun I think that it would have been there.  Right now I am just happy that I've got 3 slices left over for the week!!!"
S5MYcMCSgqGJRLO8N5Uk3Q,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"I was never excited about bagels before in my life until Big City.  Now I look forward to sneaking over there a few times a week for one of their freshly made delicacies.  BCB is family owned and family run and the kids are just wonderful, hard working people.

I know that they have specials after two for a dozen bagels and they look like they wonderful sandwiches.  All that I know thus far is that the quality of their bagels is second to none.  They are larger than the competitors and prepared better.  The coffee is great, and is self serve.  The store is clean and has about 5 or 6 tables outside so you may enjoy your day or take your dog along for a bite.

I never thought I'd be raving about something as ""blah"" as a bagel.  But BCB is so much more than that.  Enjoy!"
LgroNa-JH5W-wpJACXuz5A,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,3,"They advertise ""All you can eat"", but this isn't really the issue.  Its really ""As much time as you can commit to sitting down in the restaurant"".  It should also state ""As much patience as you have for the process"".  That would be more appropriate since I know that I could have surely eaten more, but was ready to get going long before my appetite was satisfied.

The place feels a little cold when you enter.  Not terrible but certainly not a cozy inviting atmosphere.  They still have the steel things in place from when they must have tried to make it revolving sushi and the waitresses are nice but speak little english it seems.  The busboy must've gone past us 4-5 times with an empty cart that he kept pushing and had a shirt on from a local auto mechanics shop.

We ordered gyoza, fried rice, teriyaki beef and a seaweed salad for apps.  The seaweed salad arrived right away, the fried rice and beef 7 minutes later (more than 5 less than 10 at least) and the gyoza didn't make it for over 20 minutes.  We presumed they forgot but they didn't.  Still, it came well past our sushi that we then ordered.

They were super disorganized.  I didn't know if people were waitresses/waiters or cooks or busboys.  I kept trying to make eye contact because I didn't know who was supposed to wait on us and who wasn't and eye contact was difficult.  And there was no rhyme or reason to when or how the orders placed would arrive.

We finally felt pressured to order desert and so we did.  Fried bananas and green tea ice cream.  They came out in this order:

1.  Fried bananas
2.  Beef fried rice that had been ordered 15 minutes earlier
3   5 minutes after the green tea ice cream.

Thats banana's B A N A N A S!  I can hear Gwen Stefani singing it now!

Just an arduous process.  The sushi was fresh but nobody points out the specials on a blackboard in another area of the restaurant.  Pieces not large, but for $20 if you've got the patience you could surely clean up.  But you've gotta be OK committing a lot of time because orders don't come quickly (well some do some don't...you have no idea which is which).  I think I've gotta get drunk first next time.  Then I'd probably love it.  But for a structured night this was not the call."
Wag4bnx38zJ4ihDn8-7--A,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"Love love LOVE IT!

I first went here with a friend when I was visiting Scottsdale and now that I live here I go here regularly.  The service is great and they always remember you.  I hadnt been there for a year and the guy bartender welcomed me and even remembered my drink (maybe I drink too much) lol.

Ray is a wonderful host and his band is just great.  Sure enough...I went home and looked at the back of my Lyle Lovett CD's and I think he's on each and every one of them!  How cool!  The music is great and if you like to dance country this is the place.  Lots of sweet people here too and if you are looking to meet new friends, Handlebar J is great for that.

Lastly...the food is awesome.  The BBQ is out of this world and even though the pricing isnt great, the quality is.

See you soon new friends.  Thanks for being exactly what I was looking for in AZ."
UOtoOybZ5vAB4aXBLc57vA,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"I hate to do this to you guys, as the grub is pretty darned good.  But I've got a few issues that I think need to be shared.

I've been to both Bottleggers, and on all occasions walked out feeling somewhat depleted despite having a full belly.  And the last time made me feel that Yelp was a good vehicle to let you know why.

I took two friends for dinner at Bootleggers the other night.  We walked into the fairly empty restaurant (it was a Tuesday) only to wait in excess of 7 minutes for anybody to seat us.  First the waitress looked the other way, then finally needed to address it with a ""sorry...we'll be right with you"".  Then a manager type walked by and said the same.  Finally that same waitress sat us at a table out in the open without offering other options.  It was fine, and the music was too loud but we took it without issue.

Then we perused the menu to find that they have seemingly eliminated any moderately priced options.  There is no ""Pulled Pork Sandwich"" or ""Brisket Sandwich"" and even the renowned burgers seemed to be absent.  It seems to be all platters now starting at $16 but most are $18.  They come with either a bun or tortilla's, although when we ordered them our waitress didn't ask so we just got tortillas.  We had to then request buns.

So we get our $60 worth of food and there is no additional BBQ sauce.  It takes 10 minutes to get eye contact with anyone despite many of them walking by the table.  I assure you that we're not shy.  Its just that they are very good at avoiding it.  Finally, the three of us ask for some more sauce and it comes out in basically a shot glass...for 3 people.  Now another few minutes while she gets us more.

Once again, the food was great.  It was obvious that they were disorganized, but once again it was a Tuesday night and there were plenty of staff.  They just seemed to be on drugs or something.

I hope they can get things together.  Once again, the music is a little loud for a dinner place (and take it from me...I am a rocker...I don't normally say that) but it was tough to carry on conversation.  Food is good.  Very good...but its obvious that they are doing everything that they can to maximize their average ticket.  The shame is, that yes...they did get us that one time.  But I don't think I'm coming back anytime soon.  Its not longer a place to get a good pulled pork sandwich.  Its a place that you've gotta drop a lot of coin for BBQ.  I'll do the atmosphere across the street
at Bandera or even the Mission if I want that."
oT82GLKa-ntmiV00sd6PGA,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,1,"What a shame...

Like so many of my failed relationships I fell for something that looked attractive, only to find out that beauty is sadly often only skin deep.  Such was my relationship with Venues today.

It looked great.  The location is cool, right near the sundial and the stone work and rustic/contemporary feel really pulled me in.  We grabbed a table outside and the waitress handed us some menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  She brought an iced tea and then we watched.

We watched the staff walk around seemingly in a New Years Day daze.  After about 15 minutes I told my friend to put down her menu, thinking that her still holding the menu was preventing the waitress from thinking we were ready.  Five minutes later I finally succeeded at getting that precious eye contact and she took our order.  Then...once again...we waited.

Now another fifteen or even twenty minutes passed and this time when I gained that eye contact I must have triggered her memory that we still hadnt been served so she went and checked.  Nothing.  Another five and she says ""I'm going to see whats going on!""  She came back and acknowledged that she forgot to put our order in and offered to buy me a beer.  It was too early so I declined, but no other compensation whatsoever was made for this screw up.

She then came back again and told us that it shouldnt be much longer...there was only one order ahead of us.  How could anybody be ahead of us?  Wouldnt the kitchen drop everything to take care of the salad (thats right...thats all we ordered).  Nope.

Another five.  ""Its almost done...there are just finishing the chicken.""  We stopped her and said ""Thats OK now...just bring the lettuce...we dont need the chicken"".  ""OK...are you sure?""  ""Yes!!!"" we told her""  We expected her right back now...no such luck.  Another five and she finally came back with the salad with the chicken.

Now she didnt try to bluff us and took fault for the error.  I'll give her that but the check came without any favors.  Didnt offer dessert.  I wasnt drinking and hadnt even hinted that I do so it was surprising that the only offer she made was for a beer?

She joked and even tongue in cheek made fun of the situation and it did add some levity.  She acknowledged ""The shitty service"" (her words) which I did laugh at.  But who would go back when they didnt even say ""Hey....its on us...just please give us a second chance"".

I dont think I will ever go back.  Maybe for a drink but I really felt bad for everybody waiting on their meal.  I think that one table left without waiting for their food while we were there.

Great atmosphere and unlimited potential I might guess but as for right now the ""New Ownership"" sign isnt winning over any patrons.  It couldnt have been any worse before.

Good luck.  Its a tough business!"
8XoDXN2DKmQGJHZhkQbJ9A,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"I should've known it was going to be a problem when I walked into the half empty restaurant on a Sunday morning and had to fight to gain eye contact with anybody that worked there to get seated.  But at that point, when you say ""There are two of us"", you are sorta committed to the place.  A few minutes later another person came and seated us.  This turned out to then be our waitress also.  It seems that maybe they each seat people as they desire in their sections?  Not sure.  But there were 4 people waiting tables and 11 tables with people.  So I cannot fathom how service could be so incredibly poor.

And when I say that the service was poor, please don't mis-interpret that the staff was rude or otherwise because they were not.  Everybody was fairly friendly and courteous etc...  But they just seemed to be running around aimlessly.   It became comical to a certain extent because we didn't really have anyplace else to be.  But all the tables of people seemed to be rolling eyes at one another at how long it could possibly be to get the check.  Or to order their food or even get a refill of iced tea.

There were tables that had still been left uncleaned from gosh knows how long before we arrived that were still that way after we left.  Our waitress was quick to explain that ""They had been crazy"" before we got there.  But for the entire hour or more that we were there all four servers were acting like they were in the midst of a ""rush"", but there was no crowd there.  They ran around and around once in awhile bringing food out with them or something.  I waited 15 minutes for the check after they'd taken my dates plate and left mine empty (so they knew we were done), but our waitress was somehow MIA.  I had to ask one of the other servers.

I give them two stars because it wasn't entirely unpleasant.  Once again, all nice people.  But if you've gotta be somewhere...anywhere else that day make sure you think twice before hitting this place up.

Also, the food really was very good.  Almost worth the rest.  As I said to my date ""I do have to admit that this is probably the best French Toast I've had in ages"", because it was.  But when you spend $13 for two pieces of Toast with no sides it damned well better be the best you've ever had.  And if you want to split anything they charge $3 for that.  Who really does this anymore?  My date ordered the salmon BLT and that was $17.  So the pricing is a little outta whack for breakfast too.

Anywhoo...food quite good but too expensive and the service just ridiculous.  Probably not heading back anytime soon.  Sorry guys."
VYuMUCoN6LWTxM80_itq1Q,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"I went to Wolfleys tonight for a change of pace.  I had been there once before for drinks on a Saturday night and recall having one before leaving as there wasnt anything close to a ""special"" or even a tavern priced beer that night.  But tonight was a Tuesday and I wasnt looking to drink.  I recalled the bartender raving about the grub that night a few months back so I figured I'd give it a shot.

We got seated outside and soon regretted it.  Surely we could have been re-seated, but it wasnt that big of a deal.  The tables seemed somehow lower than they should have been in relation to the bar nearby and there were a ton of kids playing bags nearby.  Oh well...not the end of the world.  I seem to recall that I was a kid once too...so I am cool with that most of the time.

Waitress came.  She was OK.  Nothing too personable, but good enough I suppose.  I was trying to lay low on the carbs, so I asked her which she might suggest.  I was torn between some sort of a flat iron steak (which is more than I normally do on a weeknight) or the highlighted specialty beef sandwich.  She told me that the beef was on some sort of a salty pretzel roll.  She almost made it seem like that was the drawback but that the beef was awesome.  I said ""That bun sounds great...I'll just stick with the bottom half"" as a joke.  Once again, she knew I was laying low on the carbs because I told her in order to solicit her input.

Well this thing comes out open faced.  The bun was something.  It was probably far too salty for the average Joe but you could always brush some of the sea salt off.  But when I tell you that the amount meat on this open faced presentation was less than you would find on a $1.29 Arbys junior, I am not kidding.  Half of the bottom bun was even showing.  I could tell that when she set it down it was probably the first time she'd seen our order because she sort of looked like she was a little ashamed.  But obviously not ashamed enough to take it back to the kitchen and say to the boys ""WTF!  Are you trying to get me shut out of a tip here?""

Truth is it had been a really long day and I didnt need to have the monster specialty sandwich that they seemed to describe in the menu, so I just let it slide.  It took about two minutes to polish it off so its no wonder that it seemed like forever for her to come back and realize that we were ready for the check.

Not the end of the world.  I'll live.  There is so much good dining here in town that its almost a shame that there is no time to give a place a second chance.  But I suppose that thats all the more reason that they should get it right each and every time.  They knew that this was a BS presentation of the sandwich that they were touting as their specialty.

My date said as we left ""Now we know why they call it Wolfleys...""  I asked why?  She said ""Because you leave hungry like the Wolfley...""  I didnt even know she was around when Duran Duran was around!  Good one though.  Steer clear.of this place.  I wouldnt even go back on a fool moon....Ooops!  I meant full moon."
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,3,"In this economy it is a little difficult to truly rate restaurants.  it has become true that there is more diversity in diners than I think any other time of my life between those that want a ""great deal for their hard earned money"" and those that do not care what something costs.  Although we can all understand the simple concept that ""you get what you pay for"", we are more than ever recognizing where you are paying for quality versus when you are paying for fluff.

The quality is surely exemplary here.  Unfortunately so is the fluff.  I mean the exceptional fluff...but fluff nevertheless.   The tuna is wonderful grade as well as the other fish that I experienced.  But for the price per piece I truly expected sizeable portions.  I couldnt have been more wrong.  There is a place near my home that offers ""two for one"" sushi and it is a pretty good deal.  Even though each of these pieces is slightly smaller than what you would expect you are OK because you're getting two pieces.  The pieces at Roka are THE SAME SIZE as the two for one place and the pricing is truly as high as any order of sushi is anywhere in the universe.  Drinks are skyhigh and there really just doesnt seem to be a way to get out of here without dropping $100 or more.  Even with a localdines certificate.

The atmosphere is cool/trendy but on a Friday evening at 8:30 it was dead.  I have to attribute this to the price tag in order to be here.  If price was no object I certainly would have tried (and probably really enjoyed) some of the other suggested entrees on Yelp at Roka.  The steaks are surely awesome I would guess and the tasting menu would probably be quite an experience.  I can surely see why Roka would have some five star ratings.  But for a typical Friday night to head over hoping to go home feeling truly fulfilled in a dining experience, I didnt get it.  The next time I have an expense account and wish to impress out of town clients I would love to head in here with a blank check.  But if your not ready to put a sizeable dent in your wallet, go somewhere else for really good sushi three or four times for what you'll drop here.

Lots of pretty people though and pretty decor.  Sadly that isnt realy enough these days to keep a places doors open.  I hope they survive.  I'd love to go back for a special occasion but I just can't handle the numbers on a regular basis here."
-ITj6Pu8Gdw8MmLf0XBEKQ,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"I'm shocked that this place has gotten such good reviews.  Its fun, I suppose to watch the food going around and around.  I've enjoyed places like this in Hawaii, but for me its the quality at the end of the day that makes or breaks it.

The quality was horrible.  And I'm not really a sushi snob.  But this was really pretty darned bad.  Every single item that I tried tasted exactly the same.  It was only the texture that changed with each new item, and lets face it...the texture on seared tuna isnt really all that appetizing.

Yes, it was cheap.  Yes, it could be fun and yes, the staff was very sweet.  But I can't go back...at least not in this town where there is good sushi at almost any corner."
024QUHVU7nlyW5y2BeeGLg,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"Greatest sushi find in Scottsdale. Pricing is unbelievable not even taking into account the great location. Nigiri orders $3 for two pieces?  Where do you see that?  Quality is awesome and the staff is great. Atmosphere is...well let's just say retro and if you see it with those eyes your gonna walk out with a five star experience.

I'm so sick of walking out of sushi places feeling like I've just been taken advantage of. You will never walk out of Kyota with that in mind. And the have teppen yaki tables too!  Maybe next time, but as for now I just keep going in for the sushi."
YRy8FX66W5htql2pKL-o6Q,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"I walked in not really knowing what ""California Greek"" meant.  My understanding of the definition is ""Greek food with an attitude problem"".

I tried it last night since I'd tried everything else within a 5 mile radius so it was time to try Daphne's.  I perused the menu and decided to keep it safe on my first visit.  I ordered the Gyros, but I am a little picky with Gyros having enjoyed it all of my life in Chicago.  I made certain to emphasize to the host (who seemed preoccupied with a lot of things) ""NO TAZIKI.  Just onions"".  I could tell that I might wind up with a sandwich that wasn't right so when he repeated my order I reminded him ""No Taziki...only onions.""  He replied ""no tomatoes or lettuce?""  Hmmm I thought.  They have a pita burger, maybe lettuce would be good on a Gyros, so I told him to put lettuce on there like it were a buger or taco or something like that.

It came out with lettuce with some sort of a Greek, vinagary style salad dressing on it.  This was the last addition I wanted to a Gyros, and you'd think he'd of told me seeing as I obviously didnt want creamy sauces on my sandwich.  It ruined the whole thing...was about as non-traditional as you could imagine and I already felt like an outsider with this guy talking it up with his cook and running all around like he was on speed or something.

Normally I would have addressed it and gotten a new sandwich but for some reason I just didnt even feel like it here.  I ate the Gyros and part of the pita and walked.  I just had a feeling this guy wouldnt be receptive to my problem and frankly, for $6 it wasnt worth it.  It's not like I wanted the place to be good after the aura surrounding me.

It's clean though.  The menu seemed varied and the prices didnt seem bad, but the food didnt seem that good either.  They did have whole wheat pita, but they serve it cold...like right out of the baggie.  It's not toasted or grilled.

At least now I can say that I've tried it, and that I know what California Greek is.  Next time I'm with friends and they say ""Hey...that place say's its California Greek.  Should we check it out?"" now I know the answer.  So the meal wasnt a total waste."
H7kB4p-1BsbvL522cqASOQ,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"Wow!

I had been planning on hitting Bryans up for quite awhile.  I'd heard great things and was always bummed out when I was in CC on a Sunday and ""remembered"" that they were closed.  But not today...my phone says it Saturday so I am all good.

Wonderful.  The brisket and pulled pork were awesome.  Yes....that's the way I roll.  Tried both and they were out of this world.  Both came with a side, and the fries were a huge order and tasted great.  They have warm BBQ sauce to use and the buns were buttery and fresh.

I cannot imagine a better tasting BBQ than this.  I just can't.

Its a small place.  Really a lunch place (to me) more than anything else.  Maybe a weeknight dinner but not a Saturday night kinda joint.

But once you go you'll be back.  I know I will.

YUM!!!"
dc6sPg9kNliz_Cy2yX19tw,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,4,"I have been to Shogun twice in the last 2 months, and love the quality an portions.  Last night they had a classic rock band and threw the happy hour into full force for it..  This was the first night that I ordered anything other than ""The cold stuff"", and got a teriyaki bowl along with a few pieces of nigiri.  The bowl was great...but once again the big pieces of nigiri style sushi were fantastic.  I have been to Sushi Brokers (good), RA (also good) as well as Satori and a Stingray etc...  Quality wise, Shogun is the best.

BUT

And I love this...but the atmosphere is completely different than any of these other ""Trendy"" sushi choices.  There isnt a whole lot of ZEN floating around and I think that it used to be a Hibachi style grill in the past.  Still...the bar area is a completely non-pretentious, regular bar.  They also have a sushi bar in the center...but I have just stayed at the bar the two times that I have been there.  Both times I have made great friends up there and the bartender is on top of everything.  It's dimly lit and feels like a regular working class bar with the added gift of the best sushi I have had.

They definitely take their sushi seriously.  Thats a good thing...cause so do I!  See you soon!"

In many respects, I saved one of the best for last.  In fact, this is going to fill in beside Grimaldi's as my fave.  They are so different and so good.

The place is small and there isn't much of a bar but our server was attentive and sweet.  My friends ordered a 20 pie and they just bring out half of the pizza so that we have enough room and they keep the other half warm.  Great move.  I ordered one of their Rustica pizzas.  I was very surprised at the delivery.  It was like a HUGE triangular slice.  They call it personal size, but they are being generous.  Its big.  The waitress talked me into the ""Spaghetti and Meatballs Rustica.  WOW!  They put noodles on the pizza itself!  It was awesome.

There was so much else to try.  Being a wine cafe I would guess that they have good vino but I don't care too much about that.  Based on the quality of the za I must think that everything is good.  Plus, they have wheat crust or gluten free!

The music was a little loud.  Nobody was really into the music.  It wasn't that kinda crowd but whatever.  It wasn't horrible and I can live with it for the service and the pizza."

I left 4 hours after having arrived feeling like family.  Everybody was raving about the food so I dove in and was sure glad that I did.  It was great.  I had the sliders which came exactly as I had requested (I am a little bit of a picky eater) and the sweet potato fries were awesome.  It was a football game night so drinks were cheap but wonderful.  I ordered a house special Jack and Coke and it was served generously in a large rocks glass and the ice was great.  I dont think it was machine cut!  It seemed like somebody took an ice pick to a chunk like the old days or something...how classy.

So just when I'm thinking how great this place is and how many new friends I've made and that the night cannot possibly get any better...a band comes on!  And a good classic rock band too!

I made it home by midnight, but I hear that they serve there wonderful food till 1.  Friday and Saturdays they have prime rib which looked wonderful and Fridays I guess it is ""all you can eat"" fish fry.

When the bill came my buddy looked over and said ""Thats it?  We've been here all this time and that's all we owe?""  Now that's my kinda place!!!

I can say without hesitation that I have yet to have anybody not agree with me that Grimaldi's is fantastic.  I have been to three of them and the atmosphere is good at all of them but the pizza is great.  The only reason that I can truly give as to why their pizza tastes so darned good is the ingredients.   It seems like everything is not only fresh as can be, but also the best possible quality.  From the cheese to the vegetables to the meats that they use...they all seem to be the best of the best.

If you have one choice for pizza, try this coal fired creation.  It is truly worth the trip.  As good as a New York styled gets unless you need the grease, and lets face it....that can be good too but this one lets you walk out feeling good about yourself."
t5nyOtnEv455rShOS_g3RA,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"I am a realtor and had a showing a few blocks from Oscars.  So afterwards I did a Yelp search and thought to myself, ""Hey...this could be good.""  It had low dollar signs and 4 and a half stars so I figured it had to be a winner.  I was wrong.

Now I'll be honest.  I probably didnt order the right thing....although the guy taking my order acted like what I was ordering was off the charts.  It wasnt close.  I wanted something that wasnt fried so my selections were limited and they were all really expensive for a fast food ""Order at a counter"" kinda place.  I had the trout.  It came with a strange macaroni salad which I wouldn't touch if my life depended on it, but I am strange that way.  No other options were offered and I walked out $14 poorer and hungrier than when I arrived.

I would guess that the combo platters would have been more satisfying or even just the straight up fried cod with fries.  But I wasnt looking to feel like a walking grease pit on my way home so I wanted to stick with something fairly healthy.

Once again...with the reviews the way that they were I figured I'd give this place a shot even when I saw the menu.  I mean it seemed like it had to be awesome.  But what I ordered really left me unsatisfied.

I figured I'd at least head over to the yogurt place at the other end of the strip mall for dessert.  Darned if it wasn't out of business!

I think it just ""Wasn't my night...""  Oh well!

So like I said...the two reasons I went there were a ""fail""  I thought it was gonna be inexpensive and awesome.  Instead it was pricey and ""blah"".

I guess a fast food fish place in the desert is sort of a novelty anyway.  But it sure isnt worth going to again."

We went there for lunch on a Saturday, and normally I don't really go ""all out"" in the middle of the day.  This really was no exception.  I tried to keep it light, but even the light side was out of this Frickin world!

First of all, the atmosphere is awesome.  It truly is.  It is like an ultra modern Palapa.  I must've spelled that wrong because I got a red squiggly line under it, but you know what I mean.  The vibe was very cool.  Sort of Zen and the porch was part of the bar area and vice-versa.  There was a good crowd and everybody seemed to be having fun.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and just as described it was ""heaven on a bun"".  My girlfriend ordered fish tacos that she raved about.  Sweet potato fries were killer.

We sat at a community table because it seemed like the happiest place to be.  Down the table some people ordered the scorpion drink which was like a mai tai with 10 straws.  It was huge and didnt seem overpriced...especially when I saw the happy hour menu.

There were a ton of things on the menu that Ive gotta try for dinner one night soon.  Everything seemed so yummy.  Service was really friendly too.

I am dying to do happy hour here.  The bar area seems awesome!!!

The other Rosati's on Scottsdale Rd and Shea had great reviews and had pictures of the pie's that seemed really appealing.  The one in particular looked like a Chicago style with the sauce on top.  Lots of red sauce seemed like home to me so I decided to give this a shot.

I ordered and got the pan which I was told was the right one.  I showed up 25 minutes later and it was ready for me.  There was a sweet young girl working there and I think her boyfriend was hanging out at the counter too.  They were both young kids that seemed like they could be a little rough (like I was at that age), and I thought that the average patron might be intimidated by this.  But to me it reminded me of a Rosati's that I grew up near outside of Chicago.  The employees always had their friends hanging around smoking and playing video games.  And this experience seemed like a walk down memory lane.

So I get the za and its huge.  Much bigger than I thought, but whose gonna complain about that?  Not me...that's for sure.  But when I opened it it was just a giant pan of cheese.  Not only was there not a hint of red sauce on the top, there was exceptionally little within the pie.  And the truth is that the cheese was really quite overwhelming.  Especially with very little to counter it other than the ingredients.

Crust was decent.  To be honest, it would've been quite good had there been just a little less cheese and a sizeable portion of marinara.  If you read their competitors reviews the ones that always seem to score big points do so because of sauce.  So you'd think that they would use more or at least use enough that the average Chicago guy would be happy with it.

We ate about half and (this is horrible, I know) we threw the rest out.  We never do that.  But our guts were overwhelmed with the cheese and grease and it wasn't worth it to eat it as left overs.  It just plain wasnt good enough.

Oh well.  Maybe we will try it again and remember how to tell them that we want it.  It could be good...but the way that they seem to make it without instructions really would never make the grade back home.  And it isn't ""The water""..."
pEAK3gldYMwpuJfdn8y2Ew,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,5,"What a gift to have around the corner!

I agree with one of the previous reviewers....from the outside it doesnt look like anything special.  But the inside is wonderfully appointed with tasteful furnishing and artwork.  Tranquil and peaceful.  The bar too is unassuming yet refined and classy.

The waitstaff is all wonderful.  You'll feel like you've been transported to another state of mind where customer service is once again important.  The guys are great!  Such professional courtesy.

The menu is great.  They have pictures for people so that they know what they are ordering, yet the staff is eager to offer suggestions.  Everything is a speciality.  They have 7 or 8 different types of specialty rices.  The lamb shank is incredible as are all the kabobs and the kebodah!

No matter what you order, they bring out the softest, fresh hot pita with butter and raw onions.  May sound like a strange combo, but you won't feel that way after trying it.

And no matter how awesome your meal is (and I promise you will be shocked at how great it tastes) I challenge you to find a way to finish it all.  The portions are wonderfully huge and your mouth will be watering the next day waiting for lunch to arrive so you can finish it.

Best of all...despite the fact that this feels like a ""Saturday night special place"", its affordable enough to enjoy any night of the week almost.  Especially because most of you will get two meals out of it!!!

I have learned to love The Persian Room also.  But PARS is so much classier...so much more romantic...so much more ""approachable"" for those of us not from the middle east.  And the food is better here too.

Gotta check this place out!!!!"
p0mrAI9F5obInFizyfc_0A,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,2,"Quite possibly the biggest rip off in town.  Small patties not even cooked to order since they're so thin. Nothing buns. Big, big prices. To make matters worse it's louder than loud. Probably all the 4-6 year olds coming from the children's pottery store next door.

Nice waitresses though. But man are these price tags a joke. Plus, fries or onion rings are $5-7 extra.  Why?  I guess it's because they can.   But not to me. At least not again."
KqIlYxhS64da2dGfXkrDmg,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,3,"At first I walked in and felt like I had found the promiseland.  It wasnt too crowded and the waitress greeted me as though we were old friends. All that I could see were rows and rows of steaming buffet tables.  With that, I didnt even sit down before heading over to a station to grab a plate and begin the feast.

I went straight for the sushi and it was good.  Nigiri pieces were small, but thats fine.  Its all you can eat!  I piled on about 6 pieces and grabbed some peel and eat shrimp and went about my business.  I did the same after that with orange chicken, duck, bacon wrapped shrimp, fried rice, noodles, pork sparerib, and a bunch of other things that looked appetizing.  All this for less than 13 bucks a head!

Anyway, the long and short is that the quantity is crazy!  There must have 60 different items including whole crab and crab legs...even frog legs!  But at the end of the day the quality of all of these items is very, very ""so so"".  The crab legs would never be worth the effort as small as they are nor was the crab.  The peel and eat shrimp werent really worth it either as small and shelled as they were.  The duck was mostly bone and for the fan of frog legs they were tiny.

The oriental offerings were fair in taste.  Didnt hold a candle to a Panda Express quality even (Boy...I would love if the would do and ""all you can eat deal""!)  Nevertheless, they did have some treats that you couldnt find elsewhere like sticky rice in plantain leaf which I always love!

Now there is no way that you can touch this price for all the items available!  So I have to give them kudos for that.  Its got to be great for kids to be able to try so many things that I sure as heck never tried when I was young...but if you are seeking quality along with your quantity I might sugges heading just a mile or so East to the casino...but it's gonna cost you a few bucks more for the buffet.

If you are saving room for dessert, dont.  Nothing special in this department other than the soft serve which you can dump on top  of the ""apple pie"" (not really apple pie, but apple filling with some crust on it).  No matter how much you eat we can always save room for soft serve!

Once again...the waitress was sweet and was very attentive.  I dont normally tip at buffet's but I did since she was right on top of our dirty plates when we were heading up for more.  A definite plus!!!

So bang for your buck?  5 stars!  Quality of food? 2.  Total...probably a 3 to a 3.5.  I will be back one day when I skipped lunch and just got done at the gym and am FAMISHED!!!  But probably not til then...

But I am sure you'll be around since it's surely one of the best deals going.  See you then!"
wZRQxolIU7jNGoz2c-BkrA,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,4,"As far as fast food goes, this place is at the top of my list.  Its always fresh and it is a treat compared to other food choices.  I'd never really had Hawaiian food before and didn't quite know what to expect the first time I went here.  But its really pretty much like comfort food.  And I love it.

But the real reason that I'm throwing 4 stars out is because today is the first day that I went there for lunch and the special is a screaming deal.  I got the Katsu Chicken and the portion was huge for $5.49.  My only regret is that I haven't tried more on the menu because the few things that I stick with are always wonderful."
NRAwvyYffhIG0xxfAL-l2g,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,4,"OK...

Well I will boost ya back up a couple of notches as I just received a call from my pal telling me ""That all is good over at All American.""  Apparently the owner was on top of my previous Yelp review and vowed that there will be two bartenders taking care of patrons from here on out on Saturday nights.  Like I said before, I'll be back.  I have always liked your place.  The view of the fountain, the TV's for sports buffs.  The friendly staff (especially Lauren) who knows more about rock and roll than most anybody I know...so I really would've missed you guys!

Glad that you jumped on it.  That's the way professionals do it.

See ya soon."
DzVexh7EGld_2ziA1lRq9w,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"I really like this place for ""fast"" food without feeling like you are at a McDonalds. You order your food at the counter and pay there and they bring it to you at the table, but will come to your table again to see if they can get you anything else.

I have been here many times now for dinner when I just wanted a quick, fairly inexpensive meal, and it is consistent and reliable. I have only had chicken sandwiches but each one has been great. I'm also told the burgers are good. I love the sweet potato fries. The milkshakes are also fantastic. They sell beer which is a nice plus over typical fast food places."
VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,I have been  coming here regularly for many years and this is one of my favorite restaurants and definitely my favorite Asian restaurant. I rarely stray from the cashew chicken because I love it so much but have had many other dishes that are also very good. The appetizers including lettuce wraps and spring rolls are great. The chocolate won tons for desert are great. I love the atmosphere. The service is usually excellent.
ukCTLs6T8LY1eUBXiAlmCg,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,5,"Wow. I didn't think anything could top Mastro's but this may have - and then I heard it was owned by the Mastro's family. The steak, sides, and service were all fantastic. I loved it and can't wait to go back."
b_8jCti0vuouJ_fjZpdmZw,G-DhjWgbcCXuYix3zUGSlg,3,"I have been here twice for dinner. The first time was great and though expensive, I probably would have given it four to five stars based on how good my dinner was that night (scallops and dirty rice). I recently went on a Saturday night with a large group of people however and had a bad enough experience that I won't be back. About half of our party thought their food was 'ok' (including me). The other half said it was good. The other problem was the ridiculously blaring music in this tiny place. You couldn't hear each other talk despite yelling and this is in an expensive restaurant! We complained and were told it is music night and they have a dance floor. Well the place was about 25% full and no one ever danced. Maybe if they turned down the music they would get more customers on a Saturday night. I won't be one of them though! I would have given it a 4-5 on first visit and a 2 on second so it's now a 3."
yFUvKpW66cNsYXD6inDsog,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"Like others, I was brought here by the good reviews; especially those of the gnocchi, which is probably the only type of Italian food I'd pay money to go out and eat (y'know, spaghetti and all that pasta-y type stuff is so easy to make at home. Ever try making gnocchi? I have, pain in the ass).

Run-on parenthesis sentences aside, I wouldn't say I was blown away by the gnocchi as other reviewers. However, I did enjoy it. Along with that, our server was both attentive and actually *from* Italy, which kind of adds to the experience. The complimentary bread is probably the best I've had in an Italian restaurant; very soft and the crust isn't too hard like most places.

One star off for the on-table plates having what looked like grease smudges and the stupid ""that's what she said"" joke one of the bussers at the wait station (which was unfortunately right next to our table) uttered.

Other than that, I'll just add that I don't find the portion sizes to be as great a value as other reviewers suggested, but maybe I'm being a fatty.

All-in-all, a nice place."
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"The food here is all right, the atmosphere better.

The lady and I got a couple of pasties, the shepherd's pie one and the cheese steak deal; they were okay, kinda bland, but hard to dislike something in a pie shell.

The atmosphere was about perfect for what you'd expect a British pub-type place to be. Dark, with lots of gregarious riff-raff and guys with beards about. Probably doesn't sound too appealing, but I found the authenticity to be nice."
XPLSNGSClW8gR5BTcvyOhQ,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"Not big on reviewing chains, but I really like this place. The atmosphere and staff are what did it for me; I like the deep Italian American feel of this place, with the pictures on the wall depicting the feel of the old country with the garnish of Americana (pics of Sinatra, Hepburn, stuff like that). Staff is ultra-nice and they give you a tour of the kitchen so you can inspect its cleanliness before you even eat; impressive, to me.

The food's not the best Italian I've ever had, and the price is kinda high, but it's definitely passable in the taste dept. Plus, like I said: The atmosphere makes it."
fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Typical ""upscale"" chain kinda place; retro decor (which was nice; besides old time posters and what-not they had a Fred Astaire movie and The Lone Ranger playing on the tube, as opposed to the normal sports vomit) and all the bar food you can eat with cutesy names.

I went here mostly because I wanted what I think of as Chicago style pizza, which is what they call ""stuffed"" here. It was tasty, what I expected, and our waitress was accommodating and outgoing.

Not really sure why anyone would get the normal Chicago-style (thin crust) they have there; as my wife commented: ""The shredded parmesan they spread over the pizza is thicker than the crust!"" but hey, isn't my problem if someone wants to pay $18 for a 3 oz. piece of dough stretched to oblivion.

I DIGRESS. In any case, an okayish place. Just don't come here if you're looking to get seated fast, as it's always packed, or if you want some kind of authentic Italian pizza or small business experience."
iD-D6tIN7o17HIb8bbxuXQ,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Not for me. Ate some slices around 5pm and have felt bloated and nasty all night; it's that kind of pizza (fast food-quality). Put a gross film on the roof of my mouth.

Also, not sure what's so ""zesty"" about their pizza- had to be the least salty pizza I've ever had.  I'm pretty averse to salty things normally, but I couldn't even taste anything on either the Philly cheesesteak or margherita slice.

Customer service was fine, except the guy who took my payment wiped his nose with the back of his hand right in front of me."
v2tjswIV3e0c8o7_7MwYmg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"It's Mellow Mushroom, so the one thing that's sure to be good is the pizza.

NOW ON TO THE BAD: This is kind of a hit-or-miss ""bad"" thing, and I actually wrote about it in a prior review of the Tempe location. The problem is the pushy beer upselling. I understand they have to make money on these beers and it seems their primary motivation, but some of the waitresses are just ruthless with this junk. Upsell if you must, but have some freakin' discretion. Luckily, this has happened just once to us in going to the High St. location, but once was enough.

Said waitress was not only obnoxious with trying to sell beers, she even sat down at our table and ogled us, complete with alarmingly fake Scottsdale smile, as we tried to decide what to order. Creepiness just in time for Halloween, I guess. As other reviewers have noted, the wait staff seems to like to disappear for long periods and fraternize with coworkers as opposed to doing simple tasks like bringing the freakin' check back.

Like I said, it's hit or miss. Generally, and especially at High St., we've had a good wait staff experience; just seems the wait staff and the upselling are low points to the 'shroom.

As for other stuff, the decor and set-up here are pretty nice; plus, it doesn't seem to get overly packed here (last time we went was on a Friday night at Reverse Happy Hour; it was busy, but not loud and filled with bodies or anything).

I reckon you should just cross your fingers that you don't get a potential car salesman for your waitress."
CRVtzesMuwHK-phmS_ojaA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"It's okay pizza. The sizes are kinda off, as both times I got an X-Large (16"") they've been kinda small. Like another reviewer said, it's your average NY style pizza.

I don't really like when restaurants have to incessantly reference some TV show they've been on (in this case Breaking Bad and some Food Network show or something); it's tacky. Venezia's does this with all the style of a brat who just won the spelling bee. Once again, it's pretty simple pizza, not some place you really need to visit for its gourmet fare or its ability to make you be able to manufacture meth.

Their slices are a nice size and look pretty good for 2.50 a pop, though I'm not sure if that's just cheese or the ones they have featured in the display case up front.

Customer service seems okay. Check this place out if you want NY-style pizza, I reckon."
h-Oq86DZfZad9kKXe8m7Lg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Have been wanting to try this place since I first came to Phoenix, 4 years ago.

Well, it was okay. After all this stuff I heard about these Reyes places, I must have had too high of expectations. I got enchiladas and a gordita; the enchiladas were standard Mexican restaurant fare. The gordita was, as well, but they went crazy with the cilantro so it was pretty bitter. Not having salt on the tables was annoying, speaking of that. The wife got one of the quesadillas de maíz, and it had a pretty generous meat portion; so, that was cool.

Atmosphere is typical casual Mexican restaurant (soccer on TVs, orange/brown-hued walls with generic ""Mexicanish"" things like sombrero-wearing dolls), but there are actual Mexican patrons in there; so that's a one-up for the authenticity, I reckon."
UWuB3vikQmf0-x2ZXjxdmg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Was feeling in the mood for some NY style pizza, and this seems to be the only place anywhere close to my house that has a 16+ incher for a non-retarded price.

Well, got the pizza and it's just so-so. Asked for extra sauce, and though the guy repeated that in my order it doesn't seem to have it. Doesn't matter anyway, as the sauce tastes like what you'd get in spaghetti-os. They also douse the top of the pizza with some not-very-good spice combination, so you can barely taste the cheese or crust.

Oh well; guess that's what I get for wanting NY pizza from a place all about Philly."
TH_Vr8_LCnAXFDUqSkF-HA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"After having others recommend this place to me as the best Mexican in Phoenix, even going so far to say ""I drive such and such amount of miles just to get there!"" I was sorely disappointed when I tried the restaurant's fare.

I had a shredded beef burrito with a side of beans and my wife had some sort of chicken quesadilla, but you wouldn't know any of the dishes from a saucer full of salt. Yeah, the saltiness was that bad. On top of that, my wife's food was so greasy she didn't eat more than a few bites till she lost her appetite and returned it.

The service was good; the waitress was nice and didn't give us any flak about the return, taking it off the bill. Other than her, though, this place loses; ""best place for Mexican,"" indeed.

I've basically given up on finding decent Mexican in Phoenix; can cook better, myself."
65kCKrnO3SulNYEen0itGg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"As New York-style pizza goes, this place is pretty run-of-the-mill. You'll find your white, meat lovers, all that; just wish they offered a few more good toppings like goat cheese (or even feta, for that matter) and had a nicer dining room. Still, if you're looking for NY pizza done right (i.e. no out of the can mushrooms and mess like that you'll find at those cheap looking NY places in strip malls) this is the place.

I'd also like to comment on the staff, since some other dope blasted them for being dirty or whatever. I really liked these guys; there were only two on a Friday night (with a driver who was in and out), the dough-slapper and the counter guy. I really liked their rapport; it wasn't anything witty, just really homey and you could tell they were all right guys. I had a little discussion with the owner lady, and it was also pleasant.

As they might say in New York*, ""IT'S GOOD PEOPLE""



*I am not from New York."
13KW8P5n1jAxxHB7Bl_obg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Well, I had an experience very similar to reviewer Kelly C.'s. In a nutshell, the food was a joke, service was spotty, menu was inconsistent and the owner was a douche.

Here's the long story:

The wife and I drove by this place a week ago and were intrigued by the name and the Scandinavian cuisine, so we decided we'd go. We looked online at the menu choices, things seemed interesting but we didn't memorize it or anything. Well, we should have, as their table menus (printed on regular 8.5x11 paper) had very little description of all the oddly-named Scandinavian dishes; so, we had to trouble the waitress to describe them.

After all that, we ordered. I got some weird-named dish which was basically shepherd's pie and the wife ordered gravlax (kinda like salmon sheets). After ordering, I had forgotten if I had asked the waitress for the beef in my pie (the other choice is pork) so I got up and chased her down. She told me ""No problem, the kitchen's running behind so yours hasn't been started yet and I'll tell them."" Well, as you probably guessed I was served the one with pork despite waiting 30+ minutes for it to come out. Not only that, they gave us the wrong sides so I had to wait while the poor waitress went to the back to get the correct ones to even tell her of the pork deal.

I'm not some baby who can't eat pork, I simply ordered beef and wanted beef. When she got back, she apologized and picked up the plate and went to the owner to ask what to do. Said owner had been schmoozing people who were clearly the ""bottle wine buying type"" the entire time we were there. I saw her whisper in the waitress's ear, and the waitress came back and said ""I'm sorry, this is my fault but we're out of beef for this dish today and I should have told you that. I'll buy you dessert of your choice."" Well, that's great and I'm glad the waitress was nice but I don't think that is her responsibility. I also don't buy that they were out of beef; could be wrong, but come on. By this time, I was impatient and hungry so I just said ""Okay"" and ate my food.

To the food: More B.S. Not only did I get pork I didn't order, but the insult was that it was just some school cafeteria-like boneless fatless pork patty. You'd think some real scandinavian kitchen would have some kind of slow-cooked, fat dripping off delicious pork. The gravlax, which we were told was given some kind of salt dry rub had absolutely no flavor. It was just raw salmon, big deal. The only highlight here was the fermented sides like the beet and horseradish and the sauerkraut, but for a pork patty smothered with boring mashed potatoes and a weak plate of gravlax we still paid almost 50 bucks and that's *with* the free dessert (which was apparently pretty good, according to my wife- it was the citron fromage)

The owner is apparently Polish, so on that note I'm not sure what qualifies her to make a Scandinavian/Canadian restaurant; but I guess the results of this visit show that she is not qualified. Save the trip here, you can make most of this stuff at home way easier and much more cheaply with better ingredients."
cKgUCzMGuRgkbKXUsgeXUw,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"This place is all right. I really can't complain; food was decent, our server was amazing, knowledgeable, and had good and obviously heartfelt suggestions for both our table and another.

The prices are a little high, but I think it's overhead (given the fancy interior, Scottsdale location, full bar, and number of employees). The food seems to be high-quality, as well. All I'm saying is that you can get comparable food (Mexican) elsewhere for cheaper.

Still, a good place."
-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"So, this place is just all right. My wife liked the atmosphere, but I found it to be a bit too bar-ish for my taste. The dining room is extremely small, so if you don't want to inadvertently eavesdrop on everybody in there you'd better go elsewhere. Also, the bathroom's ""outside and around the corner;"" kinda inconvenient.

The food's not too bad. The salsa served with the chips is tasty; more savory than most places. Food portions are good, and I was surprised to see my chimichanga overfilled with beef- so it's a reasonable value.

Service is ""eh."" We were acknowledged and all our needs met, but just kinda felt like they could care less if we were there or not.

Not really sure why ""Old Mexico"" is in the title of the restaurant, though; like I said, it's a very bar-ish atmosphere playing mostly modern music and serving the general Mexican bill o' fare.

Still looking for the Mexican place that will knock my socks off in the Phoenix area."
TtbCOwOpNNzE7fW5CFwyng,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Welp, sorry to be the Negative Nancy amongst all these glowing reviews. It's kind of a problem with Yelp; lots of people say something's great and others just kinda go with that flow. Either that or they have no taste (hoping the prior; don't wanna seem too pretentious).

Anyway, the people who claimed these doughnuts are a step above Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts are wrong. They aren't a step below, it's just that they almost taste *just* like Krispy Kreme doughnuts. I had a chocolate-filled glazed, a much-recommended (on here) buttermilk, and a chocolate iced chocolate cake doughnut.

The verdict: The chocolate cream-filled was more of a chocolate jelly than chocolate cream. After a bite, it was clear for the trash bin. The other two were not so bad, but seriously tasted just like Krispy Kreme; the ""buttermilk"" is just a knock-off of KK's sour cream doughnut.

Anyway, pretty disappointed given the reviews here. I suppose I've never liked doughnuts, for as one reviewer put it they have a ""fast food feel"" after eating them from Dunkin' or KK; unfortunately, as copycats these have that same feeling."
9d7N-I00hu-VkXFry4Da-g,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Not great, but not terrible either.

Pros: My wife liked the salsa, but I say it's just okay. You get two different types, and the red salsa they give you just tastes like a mix of Hormel chili and ketchup.

-Taco; Really liked the shell; it was like you get at a street vendor, seemingly just-cooked and folded. The chicken inside also tasted ""homey,"" like chicken you boiled for hours to make a soup till it was tender. Very brothy and nice.

-Speed; our food was out in a matter of minutes. Kinda scary, actually, as one reviewer put it. Is everything frozen and reheated? Didn't seem that way, as I said my taco was pretty good. But who knows?

Cons: -Lack of spice; nothing on either of our plates had any spice. That said, I feel this place is definitely Mexican food for dumb Americans who can't handle it. Not that I'm looking to burn my mouth on every bite, but a hint of something here and there wouldn't hurt.

Most everything else about this place is unimpressive, but passable. The decor is what you'd expect, service is decent, prices okay I guess. I'm not sure why other reviewers think this place looks dumpy, seemed clean and presentable to me. I'd say ""in a pinch, it'll do,"" but with so many other Mexican places around that's meaningless and Manuel's is just a face in the crowd.

Bottom-line: Go here if you want typical Mexican with a slightly better-than-average dining room atmosphere."
RN0PTeMSF_eaeXN6VV7RwA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"A nice little sushi place. I'm not big on sushi, really, but they do all right here. Their happy hour food specials are why I went, and I wasn't disappointed. I had the spicy shrimp roll and tuna nigiri and they were tasty and fresh; plus, they only costed something like $8 together. The lady had kalbi, and it was okay. Giving them the benefit of the doubt on the kalbi, since I guess this isn't so much of a Korean specialty place.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, clean and modern. Our waitress was nice enough."
6Cl15LapBVhw4ZfBIeVJJA,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"Went here with a friend; it was all right. It's nice to find a place that you can order something and avoid all the baddies (wheat, excessive oils, et cetera). Still, they could be a little less stingy with the meat; got like four small pieces for my sirloin kabob.

The owner came over and asked how we were doing, but not in a schmoozing way. That was nice.

They're a sitdown place, but it's more ""fast casual"" than ""fine dining.""

I might go there again."
HjXI6lKGPVNQ8dYJPtaOCg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"As promised, here's my ""make-up visit"" update.

Things improved dramatically since the last time I went. Firstly, our server wasn't an upsell machine. In fact, she was very polite and concerned about our order (Mine was particularly attentive with replacing and putting on the side of some ingredients, and she and the staff double-checked with me before and afterward to make sure everything was hunky-dory). The food was great, as always; had my first MM calzone, and I actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have.

No mention of this in my first reviews, as I don't recall going to the bathroom, but their bathroom is great! Ha, maybe TMI for a food review; however, really impressed with the privacy of the stalls.

Back to more relevant things, I was confused (though I suppose not off-put) about the happy hour rules (we went after 10, which is advertised as HH); apparently it isn't half-price appetizers on some nights and instead is a slice of pepperoni or something for $3? Not sure I call that a deal, but I guess beers being half-off makes up for it.

I was kind of disappointed they didn't have Fall Woodchuck as I went during their fall-themed beers time, but I guess it's kinda a pussy beer anyway (I'll qualify myself by saying I'm more of a straight liquor guy, but Woodchuck is my guilty pleasure). The waitress had a nifty hand-written updated list she kept with her, and while I'm not a beer man I can appreciate the effort in something like that.

Anyway, like I said, they seem to have really improved here and I definitely recommend them; for the food if not the service. BON APPETIT!"
_9vGmNrEcLWFOnUzeUdfag,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,3,"This is an okay place somewhat ruined by all the hype surrounding it. I'll just do a ""pro/con"" thing:

PROS

-The beef brisket was pretty badass.
-The homemade root beer was pretty nice, especially after not having root beer for a long time.

CONS

-The lines. We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed. I know there isn't much to do in Old Town Gilbert and maybe this place is the highlight, but geez. By the time you get all the food on your plate, it's cold from waiting in line so long.

-The sides. While the meat offerings all seem super-tasty and well-seasoned and all that, I think they kinda got lazy with the sides. The mac and cheese surely comes out of some frozen package, and other offerings that my table mates had weren't much better. The cornbread was really the low point for me, as it was more the northern ""sweet"" type and was dry and crumbly.

-BUTTA. Yeah, this is just a pet peeve of mine, but the ""butter"" they offered was not butter, I'm pretty sure. I'm anal about hydrogenated oils and polyunsaturated posers, and it had the consistency and look of one of those tub margarines, so let's call a spade a spade.

-The seating/atmosphere: Since half of the area is taken up by people waiting in line, you have to sit on the far and dark side of the place (or outside) to avoid people standing over you while you eat. Guess you can't blame a place for being busy, but that doesn't really give any consolation. The place is also so dark, and not in a charming Italian restaurant way.


All-in-all, I'd say this is more of a 2.5 review than a 3. It really just feels like a soup kitchen with a bunch of starving homeless people, but hey: The meat's good."
ygZSfAsnlztdeWZOlJA2Ug,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,2,"Went here to check it out since my coworker was singing Barro's praises. Welp, it's pretty run-of-the-mill. The crust (the most important part of a pizza) is weird and kinda spongy, but otherwise comparable to any other run-of-the-mill pizza joint.

I got the Kona, which is some kind of play on a Hawaiian pizza except it has chicken instead of ham and some kind of sweet teriyaki glaze instead of red sauce. Not very good, and if I had it to do again I'd just get a traditional pizza. Still, don't think it's really worth it without a coupon or something.

The staff was nice and the atmosphere if you're dining in (I didn't) seems above average for this type of place."
INuaxyGB7eE_6xMtYUersg,2ad9Ug6RNpE3AhCRpus4mg,4,"This is the best of the fast-foody-type Mexican places (like all the -bertos, Amado's, Vaqueros, et cetera), and in fact I say the only one worth even visiting. It's definitely authentic; not healthy by any stretch, but authentic. They do indeed make things like tortillas and masa right in front of you, and you can tell it's a small family operation as there's an older lady and I guess her older husband in there all the time (as opposed to the young brats who ""run"" most of the -bertos). If you're looking for a guilty pleasure,  especially late at night, THIS is the place to go.

Also, I've been to other Salsita's around town and they're comparable, but not quite as good as this one. (On 32nd)"
tYYJYqbw1zasFUCqrkawKQ,-3gIDSqZ04FROn3du4CK2A,5,"I've really owed this review to Eagles Buffet for a while now.  For perspective, I've done the usual buffet/brunch rounds in the Valley (Biltmore, Phoenician, Camelback Inn, etc...).  So, I get it, it's a casino buffet - nevertheless,  a couple consistent points merit the five star rating for Eagles:

1) Creativity: You can tell they're always trying little twists without compromising quality - their fish dishes on Friday are always pretty creative and tasty and I personally don't really like fish very much!  The variety and tasteful preparation is very refreshing.

2) Attitude: This is key - you can ask the buffet staff about the foods, and they are actually interested in talking about them and providing details.  You can tell they're into what they're doing - it really lends positively to the experience.  The wait staff is also very attentive.

Caveats:

I really only show up for the weekend dinner/brunch options - I'm not into crab legs (battling little crustaceans isn't my thing) which is apparently an option for weekdays.

No, it's not Vegas class endless food options scenario, we are in Arizona - however, if you're looking for that, maybe Talking Stick brings you a stitch closer - but just a stitch and I guess a couple of miles closer to Nevada so..."

I remember driving past my first Culver's and wondering what a 'Frozen Custard Butter Burger' was and in larger sense wondering what was wrong with Wisconsin, only to find out I read the sign wrong - which is more of an Arizona educational issue... .. .

Tempe Beach Park with its old school WPA style entrance - left, modern glass laden towers - right, sitting along another question called 'Rio Salado', little bit of Papago and Camelback in the distance, a little hint of palo verde blossom in the foreground - drivers, bikers, and joggers making it all pass-by - made me wonder.  Could this be it, what Tempe has tried for as long as I can remember - a pulse?  The question was accompanied by NY Strip (Legacy) and Dipping Fries (Marshmallow)... liked it.

Good for Monti's on making this play; taking that space to the next level makes plenty of sense (unlike this review)... Does Tempe have a pulse? Maybe..."

Had the Grain Mashed Pork Chop - didn't know what I was in for but was very happy with what arrived, tasty - but it was the added baby bok choy and pickled pepper on the side that really impressed me.  Definitely will return to explore this place more; and possibly upgrade rating."
UNfiku8qEyvGYjPK7w_gxQ,-3gIDSqZ04FROn3du4CK2A,5,"I'm giving this place five stars - I've seen plenty restaurants that tried to awkwardly work themselves into destinations (art galleries, historical sites, etc...) but my initial impression is that Gertrude's has created its own comfortable niche in the botanical gardens.

Had the Bacon+Almond+Date = Tasty and Bleu Niman Burger for lunch - good stuff.

Eating out on the patio, nestled amongst Sonoran vegetation, definitely made this a  local consume.

If Gertrude's stays focused on quality, uniqueness and its context with the desert gardens, it will probably become one of the Valley's most identifiable restaurants - keep up the good work."
fZM_o3kKZ9mR-1pvBeow8A,-3gIDSqZ04FROn3du4CK2A,4,"What strikes me about Tempe Marketplace isn't necessarily the actual retail center but that it's always busy, it actually seems alive... even during the depths of the recession - bustling.  And then, in contrast, I visit Mesa Riverview that emanates an erie vagrant vibe about it - even inside Bass Pro, it's like an empty nervousness - I don't know if it's location or design but Tempe did something right that Mesa did not...

Surprisingly, I never go to Tempe Marketplace for a deep experience; I go to get something and launch - I have no problem sneaking in and out one of the big boxes or little boxes.   The only time I really experience the place is burning time before a movie, walking up and down the main drag along the little boxes - nothing too interesting to see but, of course, it's just a mall... people always seem to be strolling around, visiting the shops.

Have to say though, that I do get a kick out of the signs projecting the 'progressive community group imagery' that includes that spacey guy playing the bongos - really? really?

As far as corporate retail power centers go, it appears for now, Tempe Marketplace works..."
x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA,-3gIDSqZ04FROn3du4CK2A,5,"This place gets my vote for best Tandoori Chicken in the Valley; if you like  a flavorful 'dry rub' on the outside juicy on the inside, this is the place.  Most local tandoor seems too soupy for me (I once encountered a local version that honestly tasted like they just dumped Campbell's Tomato soup on it and that's it - no joke)

On a side note, they also serve a sort of jalapeno chicken dish - I'm not savvy enough know whether this is authentic (it's kind of on its way to chinese-american) - but, my point is that I think it works - I like to see this kind of cuisine morphing (don't be shy to amp up the heat on this one Pasand - it's best this way - and if anyone complains that it's too spicy - then they shouldn't be scooping anything with 'jalapeno' onto their plate to begin with - right!?!"

Location, Food, Ambience - neat little place.  I eat at plenty of places but rarely two months later can a recall anything specifically about the experience, but Tuck Shop had fried cheese curds... really good fried cheese curds - I was in Wisconsin for a while so I've had my share, and these were probably the best I've had - usually you just end up with a fried cheese stick but here they did the cheese curd justice - and then you get some tasty home brewed ginger ale to wash it down...

Definitely a fun favorite!  Used to eat lunch here frequently when I worked nearby.  Soup and peanut dressed salad bar accompany the lunches - which is nice when you come in hungry - you can hit the ground running.  The staff is very nice - it got to the point where they would simply order for me when the special was particularly good that day...  Good flavors, good environment!  Had the Panang this evening, very tasty!"

The buffet is the main show and offers a nice selection of curries and other items that are solid in flavor and quality ingredients .  Also, the owner is very attentive, offering fresh dessert and sometimes extra items arrive at the table depending on what she happens to be working on in the kitchen.  Can't recall ever leaving unsatisfied."

I'm a fan already of CP, but this location takes it another level - honoring the local lore of Long Wongs (pretty cool restaurant and music venue - which was torn down as part of a corporate retail gentrification phase of Mill - that failed, leaving a vacant hole in the Mill landscape where Long Wongs once was).  Currently, you can order Long Wong inspired wings at the Mill pasty location and taste a bit of Tempe history - hope someday they'll consider creating a pasty along the same lines (?!?!)

Went for the lunch buffet - rich flavors, enjoyed tasting all the various spreads and dips, the cucumber salad with the crispy pieces of toasted pita was particularly good.  Thought the pudding offered a good closure.

Fresh baked pita bread; still inflated like a little balloon - light and tasty.

They serve breakfast 'all day' (which is why I showed up) - some cool twists on the traditional omelets - the sourdough was tasty too...  The owners were very nice and offered good conversation.  Definitely headed back for the Monti Cristo..."

Like a small sandwich making dynamo - your order is taken and then, bam-bam, a tasty sub shoots out.  I'm stuck on the Beach Club - solid combo of cucu, avo, sprouts, turkey, and mayo - the bread is good too...

I'm into heat - but don't expect (or be concerned by) a lot out of their jerk sauce - it's a Guyana jerk style which is considerably milder than Jamaican version."

Now, 100 hundred years later, the Beaver has returned!!! (and this time he is holding a knife, fork, and wearing a little shirt - according to the logo - apparently he's not out for revenge - but he does look pretty intense).

Had my second Beaver Choice adventure this afternoon.  My timing was perfect, shockingly I was the only one there (briefly) - so I had a chance to talk with the owners and they even shared part of their lunch with me, what!

I was on a mission to try the Flying Jacob which is a chicken, peanut, chili, cream, and... banana dish that is apparently extremely popular in Sweden.  It reminded me of a sweet Thai curry - worked well with the dill mashed potatoes - pretty tasty!!

Just to back up briefly, I had the hash previously on the first go - thought this was excellent too - man, you will not leave hungry...  You can tell these dishes were intended for people who had to trudge through Arctic environments, they definitely stick to your bones...

So, until Roosevelt Dam crumbles, Tempe Marketplace washes away, and the 'real' beavers return - I'd seriously check out the new immigrant Beaver in town... Beaver Choice!"

Star of the buffet was the paneer tikka masala. Many layers of spices, butter/ghee, and tomato goodness. The owner's son (I believe) frequently checked on us, refilling our drinks and asking how we liked it. I gushed over the tikka and he told me everything is homemade there, even the sauces they offer - Chutneys.
You can tell! The paneer cheese had a satisfying chew and creaminess. How is this found on a buffet?? I was impressed. Not only with the buffet spread but the level of care, sincerity and obvious personal investment shown for the restaurant's success.
veg samosas also offered and were quite crispy and delicious, which is not what I'm accustomed to at ""other"" buffets. Fried food is usually soggy unless you get it within 30 minutes or so of coming out.
I appreciate that both vegetarian and meat options were available and oh, the naan they brought was pretty darn good. Also, chai tea at the buffet. You sweeten yourself. Loved!
This is our new place for great Indian food and service :)"

The saddest part was the tacos. Had shrimp taco that arrived with fish in it. Sent it back and when it came back there was ONE shrimp in it. Lots of cabbage, very skimpy on the good stuff.
elote was about a cup of corn drizzled with sauce. Not sure how this is an appetizer. It is enough for one person at most. Beans were cold, crusty and dry.
this place used to be good. The only positive was the service, which was friendly. Not sure we'll ever be back. Even the chips were cold and stale. Major disappointment."
fZzgTEHDElm_R6gsYxmeBw,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,5,"Went here for a special occasion, for the first time. Wow! Everything was made to order and so so good. We ordered the cactus salad which I've never had before, and it was amazing. See the picture.
Also at the recommendation of other yelpers, ordered the molcajete with shrimp. I've never tasted anything like this before. Comes out sizzling hot, with a tomato sauce that has a nice heat (but not too spicy). They sprinkle cheese on top and serve with tortillas. We killed that dish lol
hubby had grilled fish he described as ""creamy."" It was beautifully seared and presentation was excellent. I had the rellenos. The beans that come with the meals were outstanding. I thought I could taste a hint of beer in them.
the restaurant itself was colorful and clean. It's located inside a courtyard in Guadalupe. I did not find the area to be scary at all, as other's mentioned. No qualms about parking there or hanging out in the area at all. Seems safe and it was well lit.
I was actually baffled that the place wasn't busier. This is damn good food! Try this place :)"

The way it was prepared was perfect. Light batter, lightly salted, flaky, great taste and texture. MMMmmm just thinking about it makes me hungry ;)
They do have vegetable options such as corn, broccoli, salad and beans so that's what we got with it and I'd call it a success. Price was VERY reasonable at about $12 so if you are a catfish fan, you must try. They also have strips as an app as well as the filet."

Well, now I've found my mediterranean fix!
Not only was the hommus amazing (they had 4 different flavors), but they also have fried pita chips! I thought every aspect was on point, from entering the restaurant (super nice decor and clean) to presentation and taste.
They also serve fresh juices which I also love because they are a magnitude more healthy and nutritious than store bought juices and of course, sodas.

Best fried rice: Pineapple Fried Rice (fried rice w/yellow curry powder, chicken, shrimp, pineapple, raisin, and cashew nut). This item is about $11-12 and is just a bit expensive considering you only get two shrimp in a big box. Nevertheless, the portion size is generous.  We usually order a curry for the main course. The yellow curry is my favorite. MOST of the time when I've requested a certain heat level, it's been correct. But there have been rare occasions where it was made too hot. I like to taste the different spices, not being overwhelmed by the heat. Besides those things, it's still the best. Support small businesses!"

It is difficult to find places that serve healthy AND savory food but I'm glad I've found another one. If you're like me and love LOVE fresh fruits and vegetables cooked with FLAVOR you will love this place. Soup was not over salted as someone else mentioned.

The ettoufee was creamy without being too rich. Perfectly spiced and veggies were not overcooked.
The seafood gumbo was light on spices, which let the natural sweetness of the seafood come thru. We also had hushpuppies which came with a creamy horseradish sauce. Again, not too spicy which allows the flavors to come together.
I really loved everything. The dirty rice was salted just enough. We didn't want to give up the plate with the bbq sauce, we were dipping our bread in it. So good! I was very impressed with the alligator. I haven't had any this good for 15+ years. Cooked perfectly, using tender pieces of meat and a delicate batter.  Lastly, the olive cole slaw. They really put extra love into the dishes. You can tell when you taste the food.

They are filled with cheeses and garlic sauce. Since we only order pizza there, that's how I'm rating them.

I can't check to see if they got my order right in the car, unwrapping all items, so I usually find out after I get home. Obviously the employees know this and may not care.

Singapore noodles-so salty! Flavor was decent but I couldn't get past the taste of salt.
pork rolls-in my opinion, way too large with filling that is too chewy and hardly any pork. Mostly cabbage.  Pork that was present was chewy and dry.
crab wontons-decent but was sweet tasting, which I don't prefer. That's what the sweet and sour sauce is for.
Curry vegetables-loved the mixture of eggplant, peppers, onions, carrots etc. Was not overcooked which is where many other places make the mistake with vegetarian dishes. Curry sauce however, was massively disappointing. Not enough curry and too much corn starch to ""thicken"" the sauce. No no no.
ordering process was easy and food was ready when promised. 2 stars for this and for not over - cooking the vegetables as well as the generous portions.
Most likely won't be back. I don't know why it's so difficult to find acceptable Chinese food in this area. Boo :("

We went there today and all I could think of was how much better Twisted Pies was. They should be advertising the best pizza, because it was so good I can't get it out of my head lol
When we went we ordered a salami (capicolla maybe?) pizza with mushrooms. The crust was chewy yet crunchy and the sauce was delicious. Very rich and yummy. If this place was not a 30-40 minute drive for us, we'd eat there more often. I really want to go back now, as I see they have extended the menu a lot.
I thought of you today, Twisted Pies!
As a side note, yes, the decor was limited at the time we went, but clean. This did not affect the quality of the pizza or the excellent customer service. As others have mentioned, there is so much care that goes into the preparation and cooking here. You won't find this level of awesome anywhere else, not even the ""Best Pizza"" place in Arizona (was Twisted Pies on the ballot? If they were they surely would have won. Definitely the BEST I've ever had!)
Give them a shot. I think you'll love it :)"
c7I_UpoNg7ZP8UClLhbSUQ,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,5,"Massive servings! I had a skillet which made my eyes get super big when it came out. Seriously could have been 3 meals. Hubby had to help and we still had some left to take home. Potatoes on the skillet were fresh, moist and seasoned nicely so we saved the rest.
drinks were kept filled the whole time, Service was fast and friendly and the restaurant has nice big windows to let in light and allow you to look out while you chat and wait for the good food.
Would definitely come back."
cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,3,"I'm always looking for healthy foods in my neighborhood. We've ordered from Chou's multiple times. The eggplant/jalapeno dish has been good in the past, but often it is too oily and ""mushy""/overcooked. Please keep in mind, I'm not a stickler for authentic Chinese food, just looking for places that serve delicious vegetarian/plant based foods when I don't have time to cook.
I may try one more time to see if there has been improvement with over cooking the food and adding too much oil."
LBBp51YHui5gvXNSyUcLKg,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,1,"Not sure why I keep trying this place. Last time I got the Mexican pizza on happy hour. It was two soggy tortillas with refried beans, cheese and jalapeno cream cheese (which is shockingly bland and salty). I would rate taco bell higher than valle Luna. Everything is over salted.
The menu descriptions make everything sound amazing and delicious. I think hiring a professional menu author (or whatever the process is) is the only thing keeping them in business, besides the location.
if you dine in, you may find the place dark and depressing. Employees reflect this vibe as well.
I don't think I'll be back, even with all the coupons they send out every month in the clipper."
SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Pretty consistent food every time. You get the salad and bread with your meal (meh). The service has always been great. I ordered the four cheese penne once and it came with a thin watery white sauce which was very disappointing. However, if you know what to order and what to avoid you can get great food. The baked rigatony is great although they used to offer the choice of chicken, sausage or broccoli. Now it comes automatically with sausage. I really like the spaghetti capone which is a very basic dish: butter, garlic, olive oil and anchovy. They make this well also.
One more great option is quinoa or whole wheat pasta for those avoiding wheat. You can also sub the pasta for green beans, which I have done and with the delicious tomato sauce it's a more filling and nutritious option."
S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,5,"I always seem to crave these noodles on a Monday, when they're closed! Regarding the noodles, they are amazing. You'll never want ramen noodles again once you have them fresh. I love the vegetable stir fry noodles. They put lots of fresh, crisp veggies in there, including sprouts which I love. We ordered potstickers once and were taken aback at how big they were! Would love to see the addition of more vegetable options (eggplant, potato, beans, bok choy, green beans etc). I'd still give them 5 stars because as they are, everything is fresh and delicious :)"
CVP-SrS92AIWKRdtUF9B-A,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"On this visit, which was the first time to Zorba's, I ordered the vegetarian platter $10.99 which consists of hummus, babaganouj, 3 dolmas, 3 falafel, tahini, tzaziki and 2 pitas. Also included: saffron rice, greek salad, lemon roasted potatoes, and vegetable of the day.
Husband ordered the lamb souvlaki plate $12.99, medium. While the lamb was very tender and juicy, it was cooked well done. We also tried the greek fries (feta and greek dressing) $3.99. This was a great choice. Very light dressing to help the feta stick to the fries, but not swimming in sauce or grease. MUST TRY.
I was very satisfied with the portions in relation to the price. Right where it should be.
While the hummus and babaganouj were tasty, I would love to taste more ""smokiness"" in the baba. That may be a personal preference. The dolmas were not slimy or squishy which is a common issue when ordering this item at Greek restaurants. The pita was warm, soft and presented beautifully on the plate.
As well as beautiful presentation, I was pleased that the salad served was not drenched in oily dressing, which can be another cooking mistake. It was lightly dressed yet satisfying and flavorful. Adding a couple lemon slices on the side would be a great addition.
The lemon potatoes were perfectly cooked, yet lacked any real lemon flavor. I myself have tried making these at home and I believe the trick is to cook the potatoes about 75% of the way, then marinate in lemon juice overnight. When you cook the remaining 25% on a pan in the oven, you can REALLY taste the lemon.
Nevertheless, I think Zorba's is a great find. Service was adequate. I say this because we had 3 different employees tending to us. This approach lacks personalization in my opinion.
Overall, I would definitely come back to Zorba's. A ""happy hour"" discount on the platters or apps would be great!
Zorba's also offers pizzas and pastas, which caught me off guard at first. None of these have a Greek twist or flavor. I would love to see a Greek pizza (gyro or lamb meat, feta, onions, peppers, tzaziki sauce or some such variation).
Lastly, the decor and setting were comfortable and welcoming. Very nice!
I am rating at 4 stars because there is a little room for improvement."
6ZIHxvFTHC1pvAzAS0uLDA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,3,"Vegetarian sandwich was disappointing. Very dry ingredients and not enough fresh vegetables. I'm not counting the pickled daikon and carrots. Besides that, only fresh ingredients were jalapenos and cilantro-of which there was not much.
3 stars for store and bread. Lots of choices and deserts, pastries and drinks.
please work on this, lee's. I will just buy bread from here and make my own until improved. Still would come here for the interesting items they stock and fresh sugar cane juice!"
1MpaVGIL6S58X5Pvz3jWvA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,5,"I enjoyed everything about this restaurant. Interesting flavors, NEW experiences and beautiful presentation. I've never seen corn as big as they serve here! Was definitely fun dining here. You have to bring your appetite tho because the dishes served are extremely filling. I don't want to say it's because it's ""heavy"" because that's not it. Foods like plantains, potatoes, and sauces made with nuts all fill you up nicely and keep you satiated for half the day. I also very much enjoyed the purple corn drink served. If you want a fun and satisfying meal, try it. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
-aGDIa9q_1alWtiLIlpjxw,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"My husband and I decided to try this place because we love Filipino food (his mother is Filipina) and I saw the reviews on Yelp which led me to think I needed to check this place out for myself, as there are many mixed reviews.
When you walk in, you are hit with a wonderful food smell. They were cooking Lechon in the back, and even brought out a couple trays while we were looking around. Many of the reviews stated that the lechon is $8.50 but today it is now $11.95 for a pound (with no sides or rice)! I know pork prices are going up, but this seemed pretty pricey. I urged my husband to ""treat yoself"" and get it, as it looked from the trays to be fresh and delicious. For myself, I ordered the pansit as this is one of my favorites. They have a very limited menu from the kitchen if you are ordering fresh. There is, however, 3 fridges stocked with containers of Filipino favorites, all for $6.95 apiece (also way higher than the Filipino food I've had in the past at other establishments).
We also ordered the halo-halo and asked that it not be made until we were done eating. The woman seemed to misunderstand so we had to explain it to her several times.
Well, the pansit came out right away, like in 5 minutes. It has a savory flavor (if I would guess, I would say they use beef or pork stock to cook the noodles as it had a meaty flavor, and not greasy at all, which is a problem I've had with many restaurants that make this dish. The add-ins are limited: cabbage, onions, carrots and a few pieces of pork. I was a little disappointed that they did not put shredded chicken, sausage and shrimp in there, as that is my favorite way of having it, and the way my mother-in law makes it. Overall, I would say I would order the pansit again. You get a full to-go container of food for $6.95. I tasted the lechon and it was tender and flavorful. They give you a little container of sauce to go with it, but IMO it was not needed. The skin was crunchy and it was enough for two people to share.
I walked up to the counter to ask for 2 cups of water and the woman saw me from the back, and ignored me. She finally came up front to answer the phone, which I stood and watched her talk on the phone, taking an order. Finally she then took the halo-halo cup we ordered and took it to the back, thinking we were ready for it to be prepared. I watched as a man in the back started making it, when all i wanted was some water. After all that, she said they didn't have water! I saw cups on the shelf behind her so I knew she was just scamming to get us to buy drinks, which we had to do because we were thirsty after eating. We ended up buying two water bottles, puto and some pan de sol that was still warm. We still had not received the lechon after about 10-15 minutes so we also asked when that would be brought out. The woman looked confused and asked if we ordered the lechon. We were like, YESSSS,,about 15 minutes ago! She kept asking if we ordered it and paid for it, when she had the ticket from the order we made, and it was only 15 minutes ago we ordered only TWO items from the kitchen! She finally brought it out 5 more minutes later. Not happy about that.
I knew it was coming, but she brought out the halo-halo as we were still eating and so we had to start eating it before it melted. We wound up just taking the rest of our food home, as we had our desert before we were done.
Overall, I think the food we ordered was pretty good. The customer service leaves a little to be desired. No one was rude to us, as some previous posters have said, but it seems like the owners have trouble understanding requests and orders from English speakers (not sure if this is a problem for Tagalog speakers as well).
I think we will come back to try the heat and serve portions in the fridge (the ingredients are listed on the label, which I found to be a HUGE plus, because sometimes I have no idea what is in Filipino dishes), and order more halo-halo. The halo-halo was unsweetened, as one poster mentioned. However, not only did it have the beans and jellies that are normally in the dessert, but also plantains, vanilla and ube ice cream AND flan. Not a lot of places I've been to in Phoenix put all of those in their halo-halo. I liked it even though it was not sweetened. Made me want to walk over to Lee Lee's and buy some ube ice cream. I love that stuff!
So, give this place a try for yourself. Don't let others' reviews dissuade you from trying something new. I am glad I tried it and love to support small businesses over corporations. Next time I will know what to expect, and probably bring our own drinks lol!"
eOl6WS3oAjtGZpcXfv8tlA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Another favorite Thai place which is sadly underrated because they don't pick up the phone or other issues. The Mango Delight and Pineapple fried rice here are so delicious. I usually call ahead and pick up. It's always been correct to my specified spice level with great flavor and fresh ingredients. I know it's not ""authentic"" but I wish they offered shrimp puffs or cream cheese wontons like other Thai places, but I can't fault them for that.
If you love Thai food I suggest you try this place for yourself, as the reviews are pretty mixed here. Personally, I've never had a bad meal from Thai Rama :)"
02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Three words: chicken tikka masala. I've been to many Indian restaurants before and after eating here and no one even COMPARES to the chicken tikka here. We go for the buffet pretty much only for tikka masala! We ALWAYS receive extraordinary service, and the waiters always bring fresh, hot naan to us within minutes of arriving. ONLY complaint is that when we first started coming here years ago, there was actual cheese in the palak paneer. No more. There also used to be pistachios on the rice dessert. No more. I understand they may be trying to keep the price low, but I'd rather pay a little more and have the palak paneer made correctly. We will keep coming back and driving from Chandler because this place is always on point. Support your local businesses!"
TH6mQqMfKATGjuW9SfoVSg,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,2,"I've eaten here many times, simply because they are open late and the employees are very nice. The food however, no matter what I order (nachos, enchiladas, burritos), always skates by at an ""acceptable"" level. The guacamole is a runny sauce which has no resemblance taste-wise to an avocado. Many times the food is greasy and unflavorful. I would eat here again if there were no other options but it's nothing great. I'm not really sure how someone could rate them 5 stars, because there are many many great mexican restaurants out here."
nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Ok so to be fair, I'm giving 4 stars here based on how I'm averaging everything. First of all, the food here is AMAZING. Be prepared to wait if you order a baked dish because it is all made the moment you order. It's worth it though. Personally, my favorite is the Orechiette Alla Norma - Fresh Orechiette pasta, sauteed eggplant, garlic, fresh mozzarella and salted ricotta cheese in a hearty tomato sauce. VERY fresh ingredients. I believe they use ricotta salata which they freshly grate on top. OMG SO GOOD. I've also tried the manicotti and ceasar salad, etc. ALL the food is great.
SO..what to improve. Each time Ive been there, there has always been the same waitress working the whole place herself. Most times this is no biggie but there are times where she is clearly overworked and stretched too thin. I don't mind waiting for the food but I want it right when it comes out, as this place does it all right-made to order, fresh, piping hot deliciousness. They could use a busboy or some help at times. Just a suggestion :)
If you love Italian, you HAVE to try La Stalla!"
Lz6QUlFkVKtnzSISk0WUPw,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,3,"Ok so I am not a big fan of shellfish like crab and lobster. My husband loves it though which is why we went. I had been there before and ordered the alligator which was the worst I've EVER had. It was very tough and chewy. I didn't eat it.
Today though, DH ordered the crab legs and I ordered the vegetables. Both came in a bag with our chosen spices and spiciness level. He liked his order but I was shocked that the liquid in the bag was entirely OIL. I thought the bags were for steaming (as in water), not boiling in hot oil.
I will say that the veggies were delicious, with a good variety (mushroom, squash, broccoli, etc). The flavor was good. The hushpuppies were DELICIOUS!
I know that this is a seafood restaurant and I didn't order any, so I won't be to harsh. My biggest gripe is the liberal use of oil and fat. Would it be possible to actually STEAM the foods and serve a side of butter?
I would come back again because the employees were nice and they have veg options but will specify when I order not to drench my food in oil."
hyzsCj9xMpf_FFlpUSWFiw,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Ok so Culver's isn't the healthiest option but for those days when you're craving a bit of ice cream (or cheese curds) this is the place to go. They have SO many choices for mixing in to your dessert. The food is always made to order and fresh. Service has always been friendly and fast. If you need an ice cream fix, try them out. You'll be glad you did :)"
hRFKKf8jBnn4paxnNUK1hA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,3,"I thought I'd leave a review here since we just stopped by for lunch (free entrée for veteran's day). Our server was very VERY nice and attentive (Emilie?) And we never had to track someone down for anything. We were sat by the kitchen and I watched the girls working very hard the whole time.
The reason for 3 stars only is the food. Hubby did not like his wings as he likes them and asked for them to be extra crispy. He said he should have ordered them naked. I had the shrimp which was oddly lacking in flavor, since it was supposed to be tossed in buffalo sauce. Fries were very fresh and I also did notice many additions to their menu since we have been here last.
Restaurant was clean but for some reason it smelled like rotten eggs when we first came in. Maybe some gas from the kitchen? It dissipated after a few minutes.
I'd come here to watch games or hang with friends but don't come looking for 5 star food lol. I appreciate the hard working servers and did not see any slacking off, as other reviewers mentioned. Our server even mentioned she was working a double shift today and was still very energetic, attentive and friendly. I'd come back, and ask for her again. Thank you for supporting veterans :)"
7CzA5GqrELLJyRoaJQhlGA,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"The Flautas here are so good, have always been fresh, crispy, and generous with toppings (cheese, Guac, sour cream and pico). I'm also a fan of the salsa which is different than any other place I've been. I always get chips at Mexican places and morenos always serves fresh, crisp and lightly salted ones.
I like that they offer the Moreno's Burrito
(Stuffed flour tortilla with your choice meat, rice, beans, special salsa, onions, cilantro, cabbage, enchilada style, served with rice & beans) but if you ask for it vegetarian style-no meat, they have made a big deal about omitting it in the past. Need to get some vegetarian options on the menu already!
we've been going here for years and the quality has never declined. This place is legit. Totally worth the small inconvenience of finding parking or a table inside. It's a small business and I want them to be successful so I'll continue to go and recommended them :)"
WWTQUb_NUAd5Q_k7jq2r0A,qGGwCzLDw4Rut4j-58ZMng,4,"Got hooked on hand pies after trying them at a farmer's market then I found that they have a store right by my house! I've been in a couple times but since trying that first hand pie, I've adopted a plant based diet. Only reason for 4 stars is the lack of vegetarian/vegan options. Please expand the menu a bit for those of us who don't want animal products."
Ld2hhA3q3cdkptwS1fsYEg,-A0Fjt-z3RY6k4xYaiIfLw,2,"Get the chicken teriyaki bowl and skip everything else. I just got the tempura and teriyaki combo for lunch. The tempura was a carrot and a zucchini i think. Then some long thing with a shrimp tail but I don't think shrimp are pencil size. There was two CA rolls that were marginal but they do not give you ginger or wasabi. Wtf?
$10.82 for lunch just not worth it.
They need more lunch specials."

I don't know what they use to make the rice that came with it, but it was my favorite part of the meal. Friendly staff low price point for this area. We will be back for sure. I hope they stay.."

We started off with the Chicken Eggplant Barani and with the hot pita that was served made for a very satisfying appetizer.  Two Entrees we ordered were the Chicken & Koobideh Barg and the Gheimeh bademjan.  Both were very flavorful but the Barg was certainly by far much better.  We upgraded our rice to the Zereshk  as per the prior reviews and it was wonderful.

Overall we have a great time.  The next time we might just decide to order an appetizer and then share an entree since it truly is alot of food."
tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,2,"Clearly a very disappointing visit to Oregano's.

Always been a fan of this place, but the quality sure seems to be on the downward spiral.  The Beefstro Salad my ultimate favorite lacked dressing and not much beef i.e. totally lacked the zing.  The pasta was very average and the sausage was kept whole on the side, not mixed in and nothing special about the Chipolte Sauce.  In summary very average.  I could have gone to Trader Joe's got some of their fancy pasta sauce, pasta and sausage and replicated the same.

Sadly this place is now a hit and miss, as its not my second time that they have come up short.  While this chain is growing, keeping quality and service that made them a regular favorite is something that seems to be a challenge."

Went recently for lunch and ordered the Mongolian Beef and Beef Foo Young and both were awful, no taste, no flavor and very sub standard.  The prices have gone up the quality is shameful.

I think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.

Not sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality."
raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,3,"Sochu has garnered some good reviews and deserved a visit.  Decided to visit on a Sunday evening and it was pretty busy after 6:30 pm.  It is tastefully decorated in a more retro fashion than what might generally see as traditional decor for an Asian inspired cuisine.

We started off with a TAPAS the  BACON WRAPPED QUAIL EGGS and it was fabulous.  We then went on to the HOT & SOUR SOUP and it  was not your traditional variety but rather a tamarind base and making that more of broth.  Interesting and a nice take on Hot & Sour.  The DYNAMITE CHICKEN  was a clear disappointment and seemed more of a rendition of a Sweet and Sour and lacked any distinctive flavor.  We finally tried the PAD THAI and it was done with the very find noodles.  We decided to order the beef which was $4 extra and seemed rather high for a dish that was $10 and not a whole lot of beef either.  Guess 40% higher for a beef or shrimp option seemed out of balance.

Might want to try more of their TAPAS another time.  They have a TAPAS TUESDAY where the First Four Tapas per table only (please note this fine print) are $20.

Service was generally good till it got busy, when it truly took a very long time to get our entrees.  Overall it was not ""wow"" and neither was it disappointing."

Note that the restaurant is closed on Friday evening and Saturday.  Rather busy for a Sunday afternoon and it took a while to get our order in.  The decor is modern and very cool and the presentation of the food was excellent.

We ordered the ""signature falafel""  and it was flavorful.  The pita that went with it which is made fresh all during the day was fluffy and excellent.  We then ordered the Israeli salad with shawarma and also the shawarma pita sandwich (which came with a side of sweet potato fries or french fries and quinoa or israeli salad).  The shawarma was flavorful and the salad though nothing exotic made for a good combination.  The shawarma sandwich was huge.  The food was plentiful and so we had to pack quite a bit of the salad to take home with us.

The service was very good and the staff was very attentive.  It is wonderful to see family run restaurants serving wonderful home style and wholesome meals.  The menu and food could use some fine tuning but it is a restaurant that I would visit again.

After our meal we visited the store adjacent to the restaurant that sells kosher products."
TA57efJ1C0acoCx5mtLnJg,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,3,"Went to Chops the local steakhouse that has opened recently.  The decor is tasteful and a blend between a traditional steakhouse with the wooden accents and decor and a modern flair with the open ceiling.

It is a small place and so can fill up pretty easily and was quite busy for a Sunday evening.  The service was attentive and in way saw too much of wait staff for such a small place.  Wine selection was decent.  The appetizers were very generic and seemed a bit overpriced so we never chose any.

We ordered the steak salad which was very ordinary.  Iceberg lettuce?  How about some Romaine as some of the more upscale steakhouses do?  Few pieces of steak.  We then ordered the Maui Rib Eye which had good flavor and the Chicken Piallard (fancy name but just a piece of flattend chicken breast with no flavor).

Very surprising that they did not have any hot bread served which is something that would add a nice touch to the meal.

All in all, a decent value if you go for one of their specials like Date Night on Thursdays?   Is it a dinner to remember... nah, but its does not disappoint either."
7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,5,"New York Style Pizza.. a dream in the desert they say, but not so with Brooklyn V's Pizza.  Ordered a Pizza and a Stromboli and both were out of this world.  Samantha was excellent and came a few times to see if we needed anything else."
IBshKrdO914zw5sm8kgfPg,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,3,"We visited this Flancer's thanks to a Groupon that we purchased.  Heard mixed reviews and decided to try it anyways.

The layout of the location is too stuffy and even though we visited during the day there was not sufficient light.  Seated next to the area that had a stand with dirty dishes was not very appealing either.  Having grown up in the restaurant industry, it does not take much to take the used plates etc.. directly into the kitchen rather than it being in view for the customers in the dining area Its not appealing at all.

The service was super good, super efficient and super friendly and that is the best part of our experience.

Heard good things about their sandwiches and it did not disappoint.  The Braised the Lord Beef and the Philly Cheese steak were good, but at over $10 each with the extras it was certainly pricey for a very casual dining place.  The sides of Jalapeno & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie and the Macaroni & Cheese were both great options.

In summary, great service, good food but pricey, but awful layout and setup of the restaurant. The ambiance is as important as the food, and even the food was good, the dreary & non uplifting ambiance took all of the flavor of the food away.

Not sure if we will be back, even with a GroupOn as there are so many other choices."
ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,5,"Visited for dinner and while it was not very busy on a Saturday evening.  We ordered a Pizza and a Strumboli and gosh we were pleasantly surprised.

The personal pizza was wonderfully presented, excellent thin crust that was well done and with topping that were both fresh and bursting with flavor.  The size of the pizza was more in ines of a Personal Plizza Plus :).

The  Strumboii was a piece of art.  Never have I seen such a thin crust hold a plethora of sausage.  Most Strumboli's are quite hollow inside and lack much of a meat, but this was certainly one for the history books.

Gotta end on a sweet note and tis been ages since I have tasted a cannoli that is so fresh and so flavorful.

I will surely visit again when I am in the area as it truly a hidden gem."
6-ZXctu-Duee3rGY3lC-uQ,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,2,"We visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening.  Started off with an appetizer but could not find falafel in the appetizer section so ordered a platter.  Came with a generous portion with a salad but a very watered down dip/sauce on the side.

We then went on to order two entrees, kabsa and kebabs.  When they came noted that we were missing the salad that was supposed to come with the entree.  Guess they forgot?  Then on closer inspection of the kebab platter noted it came with only two skewers instead of three as noted in the menu.

At first when we asked the server it was as if nothing happened.  However when we pointed out the discrepancy by pointing out to the menu, they indicated that they ran out of kebabs so gave us only two.   Oh well that certainly did not sit well with us.  They did apologize a few times, but that was after the fact of bringing it to the attention and brought us the missing kebab.   Both menu items were OK and lacked flavor.

Thankfully we came with a Groupon.  We certainly hoped for a better experience as it seemed like a nice family restaurant, but will not be returning here."
-YfDhpfSesaoEPWWJvlKQg,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,2,"Always love a good sandwich and soup, but Paradise Bakery clearly disappoints.  We had the half soup/salad and sandwich.   The French Onion Soup was very average, the  chicken on focaccia was  sub-standard, and was surprised that the focaccia bread was underbaked.  I had the Thai Chicken Salad...which to me was a step up from a McDonalds salad and the Pannini (Cuban) was over done.

I have generally had their muffins and baked goods as a take out and they have always been excellent but there are far better places to spend your money on a soup/salad and sandwich."
pB9ZZGJaApSw2PMcOTc8og,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,3,"Nice decor and tasteful layout.   Went there for lunch and the food was nothing spectacular.   Service was rather slow, given that there was'nt much of a lunch crowd.

The sushi was just ok, have tasted better and the Bento box was interesting but nothing to write home about.  In summary great place if you have a GroupOn or for Happy Hour"
a6SqJZTFMpSOR6Qb0STyFA,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,2,"We decided to have dinner on a Friday evening.  It was pretty busy but then again it was Friday evening and coupled with the GroupOn fervor it does brings people in.  They do have a Happy Hour from 5 to 7 and live music certain days of the week, but there is separate section devoted to the Happy Hour crowd.

We ordered the Melenzana Arrivederci (Rolled Eggplant filled with spinach & four cheese, served with tomato sauce and pasta).  The eggplant was ok but lacked flavor and the pasta was very inferior with the tomato sauce that was meh....  Also at $16, I would expect alot better.  We also ordered the Penne Alla Pepe e Nero, which was Penne in a lemon black pepper cream sauce with sausage, chicken and eggplant.  Pretty big portion but at $18 it was a fair price.  However, the sauce lacked a fresh lemon flavor and seemed more like a mustard in it for some reason or might have been overpowered with the pepper.  I understand all the pasta and sauce is made in house but the quality seemed like out of a box.

For dessert we ordered the cheese cake which was nothing great to write about either.

Giving it two starts because the service was good and so was our server, otherwise it deserves only a single star.

Even with a GroupOn, there are many good choices around for good Italian Food and will not return."
9meJA6ap0hf9pjmJPweaTA,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,3,"We went to Zulu Cafe for Sunday Brunch.  Living out in the SE Valley this is quite a drive, however, we felt that the ambiance overlooking the airport/airstrip might make for a nice afternoon.

When we arrived we were told it was going to be a 35 to 40 minute wait even though the actual wait time was less than 10 minutes.  There were quite a few patrons that were turnoff with the wait time and left to go elsewhere.  It seemed like the staff was overwhelmed with what appeared to be a rather small group of people that afternoon.

We both ordered burgers, the Angus and the Zulu BLT and they were pretty good and the GroupOn deal came with mimosas that did not disappoint.

When we asked about dessert, we were surprised when our server told us that the chef had not prepared any today... whoa never heard that response before. .I had high expectations that Chef Brian, trained at the French Culinary Institute would have a bevy of desserts for us to try...... what a disappointment.

Overall, I guess I may give Zulu a try one more try, but it is a place I will return with some skepticism."
RyJIi1IP0UQ5qGbwazgsIA,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,3,"It was July 4th and with many restaurants closed today, Aunt Chilada's was open for business.

We were visiting with a friend and we greeted with Salsa and Chips which was both fresh and flavorful.  We then ordered the Pollo Fundido which is generally one of our favorite dishes.  Given that they used Chicken Tenders it was rather dry and so trying to flavor it becomes tough. The white sauce was good and over all the food was average.

While the food was average the service was excellent.  Beverly was fantastic and wish there was a Beverly at every restaurant that we went to.  She made our every experience a fantastic one.  Even though the food was A-OK, the service made it a very very pleasant experience.  Thanks Beverly for your undivided attention when we were there."
IqBoGCKUJdzBOmzjUsB7lw,Q42YidAAzqjIefeDKaV3pQ,2,"Service sucked. I've been to most chipotles, but this place doesn't put crap in your burrito bowl. I barely had any meat because they there wasn't any left some were being cooked I could've waited instead of giving me a less potion. I get like less of half of the spoon serving. She sprinkled like a pinch a cheese & lettuce. I paid $8 for like half a bowl. Other places I've been to fill up your bowl to the top so you get your money's worth."
VLDFjeqpUgWhnVuB_8GuEg,L_JiiBm0NVk-2eVqN9NJYQ,4,"YUMMM! We go to True Food for lunch as often as we possibly can! Love it! Natural, whole foods prepared to perfection. My fave: Kale Salad with Grilled Salmon. Simple and delicious. Hubby's fave: grilled turkey burger with a side of kale salad and the sweet potato hash. Their fresh squeezed juices are wonderful.  Somewhat slow service can be overlooked considering the delicous eats! If service was improved, would have a solid 5 stars."
ALn_0f-Usn3n0a9WBcjhhg,L_JiiBm0NVk-2eVqN9NJYQ,5,"I can't get enough of this place. It's a renovated department store in downtown. They kept all the good ""vintage"" parts, and renovated the rest. Such a hip vibe...beautiful people...good food. And the meat! They hand slice the prosciutto to order at the bar! Hubs and I had the bar snack plate. Delish. Although I will say the quality of bread could be improved- it was a bit dry and boring. We usually don't order more than the meat plate. This time we also shared the Margarita pizza. The crust was tortilla-thin and crispy. Perfecto!  Just like we like it!! Their sauce is deliciously tangy and flavorful. Good job, Hannys! We can't wait to see you again!"
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,L_JiiBm0NVk-2eVqN9NJYQ,3,"I've been just to see what all the hype is about. And to answer the main question: yes, the pizza is very good,. Now, the wait to get said pizza in yo belly makes this place an annoyance. Yes, they provide ample seating area and a nice flow of drinks to keep you going, but to me, I'd rather go to Cibo Pizzeria for much better pizza and not much of a wait."
_DPJ_PHJnXsuhYhsgBA0Xw,L_JiiBm0NVk-2eVqN9NJYQ,5,"Put on your fancy pants, girls and boys.... this is an old school steakhouse done RIGHT! I was so very excited to experience what I had always heard to be a legend in Phoenix. And Durant's did not disappoint. This is the real deal for sure: think dark leather booths, heavy wood furniture, a dimly lit bar - yes, you MUST order the dirty martini....the froo froo stuff doesn't cut it here. As you look around the dining room, you think about all the stories the walls must hold. The service is some of the best we've experienced - very attentive, but not overbearing. They know the menu and will help guide if you'd like. And the steaks were out of this world!. To keep with the old school tradition, they serve a relish plate before your meal. Totally 60's and 70's....I love it that they have held on to this tradition. In my line of work, I do a lot of business dinners that are usually held at the usual ho-hum fancy-schmancy steakhouses. To me, they all blend together....Once you're inside you don't really recall WHICH of the many there are. Durant's is a unique place with a lot of character; a true legendary steakhouse. I will go again and again."

The atmosphere was nice; dim lighting and energetic vibe made for a sexy feeling. Service was great! Will be back again and again!!"
BxKxFHXG4B2h1MXK8ebHZQ,L_JiiBm0NVk-2eVqN9NJYQ,4,"I'm so happy to have finally gotten around to trying out this little gem of a restaurant. All of the good reviews here are spot on! The setting is so very charming...only a handful of small tables in this special little spot. There were outdoor tables as well. The service was great; very attentive but not over-bearing.  From the second we walked in the door, it was obvious that they were happy to have us in for the evening.

I appreciate the thoughtful approach to the menu....only a handful of items in each category. We had the octopus starter - PERFECTION on a plate....unbelievably tender, with just the right amount of char. Seriously, I should have ordered two of these (...next time I think we will!). The burrata platter was amazing...so very rich and delightful. Even the toasted/charred bread was delish! It comes with a roasted pepper, which at first I didn't see how they fit together, but turns out to work well. yum. We had a trio of the small plates: eggplant, steak tartar, croquette. The steak was our favorite. The eggplant was very good; just as the server described, it kinda has the flavors of pizza.  The croquette, while very yummy, seemed to be common. For dessert, we shared the butterscotch pudding....another perfectly executed dish! We sat at the bar, which was a treat in itself, the bartender was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. He selected a really nice wine for me to enjoy with my dinner and I tried white port for the first time...such a nice suggestion!

Now, after this glowing review one may ask, ""why only four stars?"". Answer: It was LOUD. I'm not talking about ""noisy"", I mean ""can't hear yourself think"" loud.  We were initially seated at a two top, but decided to move to the bar because there was no way we would be able to hear each other talk at the table (as noted above, sitting at the bar turned out to be a great thing...). Apparently they usually keep the sliding doors open which helps, but on the night we were there, they had everything closed up due to weather. This is unfortunate as there is really nothing that can be done other than opening the doors. The only other tidbit is the lighting was too bright for my taste. Seems that it would have been so much more enjoyable to have the overhead lighting dimmed a bit and maybe more candle lighting....

With all that said, I already have plans to return (I will go in November when the doors are open)."
9GUWNQ98sQN7k2UFbsBNng,L_JiiBm0NVk-2eVqN9NJYQ,5,"This place is my go-to spot when we need delicious food quick. My hubby loves the gyros platter. Deliciously seasoned. The rice is to die for. I love the stuffed dolmas, chicken shawarma and beef skewers. Their mezza platters (mixed appetizer platter) is perfect snack with a glass of wine! Baklava is delish! They will also cater for large groups. This is a family operated business. You'll find the dad operating the front of the house and his sons in the back. Their dining room is very small, but adequate. They do not serve wine (or any alcohol for that matter) so you will have to enjoy said mezza platter at home with your wine :-)  I would recommend Ammos to anyone who loves Mediterranean yumminess!"

The dining room is charming and comfortable, the service is excellent....and the food, oh, my! Salad and starters were yummy, but not amazing. For this visit, the amazing-ness started at the entrees. I had the sea bass with mango salsa and hubby had the filet. Both were expertly prepared and delicious. My sea bass was like butter, melted in my mouth - so good! My husband said the steak was the best he has had! It's topped with a yummy garlic-y butter which as perfect! Now, moving on to desserts: THIS is were it really gets good! I had the chocolate and salted caramel tart with fleur de sel...OMG! This was absolutely amazing! It was very rich and chocolate-y, very sweet with caramel and just a little salty - perfect! I ate every last crumb! (although I did allow my husband to have a single taste...) My husband had the banana brulee, another really great dessert - he liked it a lot, but admitted mine was better.  We brought our own bottle of wine...that was really nice since I was able to bring one of my faves that's not always on restaurant wine lists.

I will go back again and again. It's a great date night spot, but also a great place to meet girlfriends or take out of town guests."

The server was accommodating, but not overbearing. And the food....ah, the wonderful food! I knew it was going to be great when I tasted the fabulous bread with pesto butter. The bread actually reminded me of my grandmother's fresh baked...some of the best! Once the appetizer came, I began to realize that Eddie's was turning out to be my new favorite restaurant. Mo' Rockin' Shrimp cannot be missed! And the entrees were unbeatable! I had a fish entree and my husband had the meatloaf. Both were perfectly prepared. And I love the idea of the ""half entree""; it allowed us to order an appetizer, entrees AND dessert and not leave the table overstuffed. It was a perfect evening. Yes, this is my new fave restaurant. We can't wait to go back....my husband and I have already decided what we'll order for next time!"

The service was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. He had the short rib stew.....OMG! if you like stew, this is the one for you.  It's almost like a chili verde as there was a delicious green chili flavor. It came with a corn muffin that was a nice compliment to the stew. I had the seared scallops plate. The scallops were cooked perfectly; ""succulent"" is the word that comes to mind (I never use that word!). For dessert, we HAD to have the butterscotch pudding....and yes, it is as good as everyone says it is!! We'll be back..."

The atmosphere is lively and comfortable as well as romantic and a little elegant. Think candlelit dining room and bar, chandeliers, and comfy chairs. There is a nice outdoor dining patio as well. We had dinner at the bar which we enjoyed even better than if we had a table in the dining room. The customer service from the minute you walk in the door was phenomenal! The bartenders were very knowledgeable in their trade as well as the restaurant's menu items. Keith was a master at directing us on the house specialties for drinks as well as food.  For the meal itself, we decided to do several of the small plates rather than two entrees.

Our meal:
Buratta with truffle oil - delishly rich
Pork Belly with Kimchi and udon noodle - the combination of flavors was amazing
Short Ribs on a biscuit - (yes, we had pork belly and biscuits in the same sitting - don't judge!) this dish was devine
Apple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream - my husband says this is the best dessert he's had in a while

I can't wait to go back for some of the items I didn't get to....we'll opt for the bar again, it was so much more fun!"

Everything tasted like grease, so much so that I finished about 1/4 of my meal and threw it away, and paid for it the rest of the afternoon with an upset stomach. If you have an iron stomach and need a quick bite to eat, this might be an ok place to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way (at all) to come here."

The decor is cool, seating is neat & comfy, we go on Sundays and eat & drink off of the happy hour menu (Happy Hour All Day!) and get out of there SO CHEAP. The teriyaki ribs are AMAZING, so are the lettuce wraps.  Nice waitresses, and yes - cool bathrooms!!! The sushi is good, the music is better than a lot of the crap they play in most other restaurants these days... one of our favorite places to eat!"
p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,3,"Nice place - the foodies of the world will disagree with this review but for those of us who are looking for a balance between the fast food joints at Desert Ridge and the fine dining options, this one works just fine.

Like most restaurants that share the concept, the menu is predictable. Something for everyone from salads to beef and everything in between. No problem bringing a group here.  They even have a nice kid's menu, desserts and an amazing selection of beers.

Service has always been friendly and they have a nice patio.
Good spot for lunch or before/after a movie."
7JjK3VpccdstvLWBr87lLw,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews for this place because my experience has been just the opposite.
I've eaten here three times in the last month. The greeter was always friendly, brought us to our table, chatted a bit and on two of the visits when they were very busy asked for our drink order.
The wait staff was attentive, answered questions and were quick on the refills.
I've had breakfast once and lunch twice. The breakfast is standard fare, no better or no worse than you'll find in most places.  That's not a negative - you can only do so much with 2 eggs over easy.  For lunch I've had the Rueben and a turkey sandwich. Both were very good."
roCxdzue-nME2akdIRPTfA,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"Remember the TV show 'Cheers'? Norm Peterson would walk in and the whole place would yell out ""NORM!"".  I come here so often it wouldn't surprise me if they started yelling, ""MANNY!"" when I enter. They won't, but it would be nice.

I work in CityScape and this is my preferred lunch spot.  They have an extensive menu so it doesn't get boring, the service is very good and the food is delicious. I think I've tried just about everything on the menu.  I usually get a sandwich but the salads are very good as well.

And, it's also a deli/grocery store. Convenient place to pick something up to bring back to the office or home.

A very good choice if you're looking for a quick lunch and want to avoid the standard chain restaurants."
CXAC3Pfo7jaEciXZ2Bjgow,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"I am writing this review to commemorate my accomplishment of having every sandwich on Potbelly's menu at least once. Yes, yes, please hold down the applause and the cheers.

While I certainly like some of the sandwiches more than others they are all very good and made with fresh ingredients. I especially like that Potbelly's offers their sandwiches as ""original"", ""big"" and ""skinny"".  I always get an original but we have a big guy or two in the office and they go for the big. If you're on a diet or not very hungry go for the skinny.  They also have a nutrition calculator - just check the boxes for your sandwich ingredients and you'll see a custom nutrition label. Nutrition and allergen sheets are also available.

If you don't want a sandwich you'll also find soups, chili and salads on the menu. Dessert? Yep, they have that too (their cookies are warm and delicious).

Nice lunch spot with a lot of options and very friendly service."
LcYrqMhUO_TITSXFk_SjJA,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,3,"If you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes in the past you already know what to expect because every city has a place like it.

Grab a tray, grab a plate, walk down a line just like the one they had at my elementary school and load up with lettuce, spinach, cold pastas, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.
Have a seat and congratulate yourself for eating healthy (ignore the 3 cups of Thousand Island dressing you also got).

Then, I guess as a reward for healthy eating, you grab a bowl of soup to up your sodium intake for the day. Then you grab a few slices (more like 3x2"" pieces) of pizza, some muffins and devour your second course.

Still feeling good about your healthy eating choices you grab a bowl, put a brownie on the bottom and cover it with ice cream, add some sprinkles and you're golden!

Don't get me wrong. I'm OK with all of the above. My kids love this place and, since they both have hollow legs, it's an economical choice and it must be healthier than McDonalds."
BxKxFHXG4B2h1MXK8ebHZQ,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"I'm not a foodie but I have a good friend who is a foodie and he insisted that we come here because I had to try it and he was paying.  That sealed the deal for me (when you see their prices on the menu you'll understand).

As it turns out I only had an appetizer and a drink (long, uninteresting story that has nothing to do with the restaurant).  But, what an appetizer!  We don't have a lot of octopuses (is that a cool word or what?) in the desert so you get one when you have the chance.  Virtu's grilled octopus with chickpeas is served with chili butter. There's a bit of a char but they are very tender.  My foodie friend insisted that I have their Let The Beet In cocktail along with the octopus because it complemented the dish (I told you he was a foodie). I guess he's right and frankly it's not the type of drink I would have ordered on my own.  It's made with salted beet syrup (I didn't know there was such a thing) with aquavit, mezcal and lime juice. It was very good.

Service was excellent and when it turned out we had to leave abruptly they were very gracious and understanding. I'll be back for a main course some day."

I wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!

A sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.

We finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.

The server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.

Overall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer."
34VuBMNaG9nJiyqsnoEgPg,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"My kids and I really enjoy sushi. The boys (9 and 12) would rather go to a sushi restaurant than McDonald's - am I a good parent or what?

Nori is a nice addition to Desert Ridge.  There are some OK places to eat at Desert Ridge but nothing out of the ordinary.

The restaurant is quite large. Nicely laid out, comfortable seating and friendly service.
The menu has something for everyone. Hot dishes, salads, Tempura (the shrimp is terrific), nigiri, and shashimi.

It's a bit pricey but worth it."
f64wkzPLEjXIbTJ9eGS6XA,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,3,"A nice choice at Desert Ridge if you're looking for something good and quick.  The sandwiches are all made to order and they're good.  They also have some very good soups but, as others have pointed out, they can be a bit salty sometimes.
If I'm in the mood for a sandwich my first choice is Paradise Bakery but Zupas is a pretty close second."
7Q2cYSl5NBYytJzgjX0oKw,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,3,"This is a generous three stars.

I don't get it.  This restaurant has mediocre Mexican food but the prices are reasonable. Every time I've been here the service has been terrible and this includes going for lunch when they weren't very busy. On one occasion my chips and salsa showed up after my entree was served and I'm still waiting on that drink refill.

They do have a patio. But, it's right on Tatum Blvd. If your idea of a beach style patio includes thousands of vehicles whizzing by then you have found your place.

I guess the draw here is the bar.  I wandered in with some friends one evening and the place was hopping. It was loud, crowded and packed with 20-somethings. For me, it was too loud, too crowded, and I've outgrown that ""go out and get wasted"" phase.
But, if you're into that sort of thing - go for it."
d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,3,"This place reminds me of one of those hip/cosmopolitan restaurants in Manhattan I used to walk by when I was a student at NYU that I couldn't afford. I like that look and, after feeling good about the reviews, decided to join three old friends for dinner.

Everyone is dead right about the chopped salad. Damn! I'm not a huge salad eater but I could have this one every day.  The perfect starter dish.

On to the main courses.  I had the Truffle Grilled Cheese sandwich. Meh. It was OK, not great.  Two of my friends ordered the filet mignon. One loved it, the other - not so much. She said it was OK but they smothered it with sauce. At $32 I'm not sure why you'd do that to a perfectly good piece of meat.  Another friend had the lamb burger. She said it was fine but probably would order something else the next time.

Bottom line - mixed reviews on the main courses - go for the salad!"
jsuUmIEefPjV__ads62Z5w,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"Breakfast at Dick's Hideaway is an experience you'll never forget. Well, OK when you're 90 and sitting in a rocking chair telling your life story to your great grandchildren it might not come up, but it is something you will tell your friends and coworkers about - but only if you do it right.

Dick's offers some standard breakfast dishes like eggs, pancakes and french toast. But you can get those dishes at just about any place that's open at 7am.  You really want to give their New Mexican dishes a try.  A personal favorite is the carne adovada and eggs but I don't think you can wrong with any of the dishes. Go on, be adventurous.

Bear in mind, this isn't a big restaurant and seating is limited - it's worth the wait."
oD-C0IhodDOtWWOiNm2txA,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"I recently took a friend who was visiting from Chicago here and he looked around and said, ""I thought you guys only had desert and cactus"".  Well, that's the usual stereotype but no, we have a lot of farms; you should have seen the look on his face when I pointed out some of the cotton fields in the south and east valley!.

As others have said, this is just a gem of a place. I just can't think of a more peaceful place to enjoy a meal.  My go-to spot is the Morning Glory Cafe. Good coffee, fresh-pressed juice from local citrus and the huevos rancheros are delicious.  After eating I like to walk through the pecan trees and check out the garden plots.

Nice, relaxing spot. Great way to start the day."
E-LZ0Xl1ETDeMrtM9H3-PQ,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"This is one of Scottsdale's treasures.  The concept is refreshing - they incorporate fresh local ingredients as best as they can. This means that there are seasonal changes to the menu but that only gives you a reason to go back.

I like to order dishes when I go out that I've never had before.  You'll find a number of odd sounding dishes here but don't be afraid to be adventurous. Who knew that I'd like braised leeks with mozzarella and a fried egg? But I do.  I doubt that you'd be disappointed in any of the appetizers but in addition to the leeks, try the pork and duck pate.

At one time or another I think I've tried all of the main courses - pick whatever tickles your fancy - I don't think you can go wrong.  Save room for dessert. A personal favorite is the butterscotch pudding.

You'll also find an interesting wine list here - I believe they are all from Arizona wineries - Who knew?  They're surprisingly good.

One tip - This is a popular place so you should make a reservation."
a98_-_s6HGtbtBvBXaeudQ,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"I went here for the first time recently.  I was in the area and all of the other lunch options in that center didn't look appealing to me.

So you don't look like a total newb - you order your sandwich and that person puts the basic ingredients on it, then sends it through a toaster conveyor belt, when it comes out the other end someone else puts your choices of condiments on it, wraps it up and then you pay and either sit down or leave.

They have a number of choices and it's nice that they list the nutritional details on their menu board. I went with a friend and, totally ignoring the valuable nutritional information, we got the chicken/cheddar and the Italian and shared 1/2 each.  Both were pretty good.  Certainly not the best sandwiches I've ever had but better than Subway by a mile and much much better than a fast food burger.

Two sandwiches, two fountain drinks - $11. Well worth it.

I'll certainly go back."
Y5CTA3S9TVkpr3Yvwaki-A,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"I feel like I'm jumping on the bandwagon here but why not?
I never take my kids here because I like to come here to avoid kids. You don't usually see children here, especially in the evening. Don't hate me - I have kids, I love kids, I just don't like being in a crowded movie theater with them.
I came here recently to see Godzilla with a friend. I opted for the premium plus seating - for an extra $5 you get a lounge chair!  I like being able to order from a server who scoots around and whispers so others aren't bothered.
Ok, Ok, maybe I will bring my kids here sometime for a matinee if they promise to be really good. However, the risk is that they'll never want to go back to a regular theater."
xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"Most large cities have their unique cuisine:
Go to New York - get the pizza or a Coney Island Dog.
Go to Chicago - get the deep dish pizza.
Go to New Orleans - get the jambalaya and the gumbo.
Go to Boston - get the lobster.
Go to Philadelphia - get a cheese steak sandwich.
Come to Phoenix - get Indian Fry Bread.

Maybe you've seen fry bread at a carnival served with powdered sugar, cinnamon, and honey. That's a good dish but there's so much more to this Navajo specialty. I like it served as a beef taco but there are a number of variations with and without meat.

Unfortunately I don't get here as often as I'd like but when I do come I'm never disappointed (OK, the service can be a bit sketchy)."
2OkYkQRItlqbKw9Mz7flCA,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,3,"OK, so here's the deal, you're at PV Mall and it's lunchtime. You go to the food court and see that Paradise Bakery is the only decent choice but that's where you ate the last 47 times you were here. Easy solution, get in your car and drive across Tatum to Julio G's.
The chips and salsa are free, plentiful, and delicious. The menu has all the standard Mexican menu items and are reasonably priced. Everything I've tried here was OK. Not, ""OMG"", but OK. Service has also been fine.
Note, the portions are huge! I've never been able to finish my entree but maybe it's because I go through two baskets of chips."
925GiWzJ_cxQaUT870xW7A,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"This is the perfect place to conclude your evening in Scottsdale. After you have dinner at FnB (you did go to FnB didn't you?) you can just take a short walk to Kazimierz. FYI, the sign that says, ""Like all good speakeasies, the entrance is hidden in the rear"" isn't a joke - you enter at the rear of the building.

It's a very relaxing environment. Comfortable seating (you can reserve a couch but I think there's a $ minimum) and there is live music every night.  They do serve food but the whole point of a wine bar is to drink some wine. I dare you to ask for a wine they don't have - their 75 page wine list has over 2,000 wines ranging in price from $10 to $10,000 (no, that wasn't a typo).  The wine list is actually sorted by price which is a nice touch. Unless you're planning on spending an hour or so looking over the wine list I suggest you look at it on their website before visiting.  Another option is to ask for the ""Nifty Fifty"" list - it has their most popular 50 wines.

Go...sit back...relax...enjoy some good music and some wine."
a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"I was born and raised in the Phoenix area and I always laugh when people make comments about the ""quality of Chinese food"" here. Are you kidding? At this moment there are more people of Chinese descent in the San Francisco airport than in the entire State of Arizona. You aren't going to find the same food here as you will find in places like San Francisco and Vancouver. It's simply not going to happen.

But, if you've got a taste for Americanized Chinese food, this is a good choice.  I'm confused by the ageism demonstrated in some of these reviews.  I haven't noticed that a lot of old people eat here, probably because I don't care.  Heck, I'd rather be surrounded by people my parent's age than a restaurant full of young children with noodles hanging out of their mouth.

I've always had consistently good service and good food at this restaurant.  I'm certain you can find better Chinese food in San Francisco, but Jade Palace is much closer."
-ITj6Pu8Gdw8MmLf0XBEKQ,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"I was going to give this place three stars because the sushi is ok, but not great. However, I'm just a sucker for the conveyor belt. They do a really good job of keeping it stocked with all of the favorites.  The only thing I don't like is all the dessert options that come by. Nothing against dessert but jello?
OK sushi, fun atmosphere, terrific place to bring your kids and the service is excellent."
j-JE8jELAHBbg6MKeAGanw,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,5,"There are a number of restaurants in the valley that try too hard to be southwestern. Cartwright's nails it without smacking you in the face with the decorations.
As soon as you walk in you're transformed. Ever watch old episodes of Bonanza? Remember the ranch house? It's sort of that feeling.  Rustic, but classy.

The food and the service are both terrific. The servers are knowledgeable, friendly and more than happy to explain things.  They have an extensive menu and they even have gluten-free selections.  I don't come here often so I always order the same things. For an appetizer try the Red Chili Elk Balls (not only are they good but it's fun to say and no, they aren't really elk testicles). My go-to entree is the trio of tenderloin medallions: 3-oz each of beef, elk and bison buffalo.  How many opportunities do you have in life to have elk and bison buffalo? Don't let this opportunity pass you by.

Sadly I'm always too full when it comes time for dessert so you're on your own there.  I did notice that they have vegan and gluten-free dessert choices so if you're trying to appease your vegan friend that just watched you devour beef, elk and buffalo this might work out for you."

This is one of my favorite spots. I usually only come here for lunch but I've dropped in for dinner a few times.  This will sound odd but one thing I like about Fuego is that they don't have 100 different things on their menu like you'll find in a lot of Mexican restaurants.

If you're in the mood for a sandwich, I recommend the Cubano. Delicious. I also enjoy the tacos (go for the shrimp!) and the Chile Relleno.

Go, enjoy!"
OZC42gnhlJ_auXduDRfMoQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Patio, Patio, Patio!

Spring time is a wonderful time to eat outside and this renovated building is definitely a new draw on Roosevelt Row in the Evans Churchill neighborhood.  The outdoor patio is shooting for French Quarter in the middle of the southwest.  It is adjacent to two other restaurants opening up soon.  There were an abundance of people rolling up to take advantage of all the bicycle parking. (***Main parking is accessed off the alley, which runs east-west between 3rd St and 5th St***)

The interior is very contemporary with an open kitchen concept and clean lines.  There is a cozy bar along the west wall with plenty of local on tap.  There will also be a walk-up baked goods counter and I'm told there will be ice cream!

Given the vogue of many restaurants recently...they went with a soft opening and still seem to be working out the kinks.  The staff is still learning their sections and the intricacies of the menu.

As for the  food, it's a solid 3.5 stars, went with the Lamb Burger which was well seasoned, topped with fresh mint leaves on their own freshly baked bun...this come standard with a mixed greens side salad.  Also tried the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich that was well seasoned on two grilled pieces of bread, with sliced cucumber and avocado.

It's a balanced price point of $8-10/sandwich with a great outside ambiance.  The menu has a wide variety to choose from breakfast, sandwiches, and soon to be great pastries.

A slow opening would not stop me from going back given all the great reviews of the original location.  I'm sure management will dot the I's and cross the T's soon enough.

Bon appetit!"
fE9SP84G6TZrv36FLbCy7w,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Let's be honest...this is one of the only outdoor restaurants with an elevated view over the valley.  Given Arizona's weather, this is a great place to go for drinks or host an event on the patio.

Patroned Top of the Rock for a friends birthday party and had a wonderful time.  The service was spot on with a buffet of snacks with everyone cozied up around the fire pit.

The complimentary valet parking is a must.  Be sure to go make your own memories"
Gz9SlLqxS6wnxPvgdOQNrA,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Overall I love this concept.  The space is immaculate with tall ceilings, concrete pillars with wood chips imbedded from the 20's, and the curtains & lighting are sure to impress your date.  Has been a month since they opened so it was just a short wait to get a booth at 9pm., but still a full house.  Staff were attractive and friendly.

I see this as a favorite watering hole when in the downtown core with dim lights and great music.  The plush couches keep you lingering for another drink.  We did not have any food on this trip, but I want to come back.

Having lived in NY, my critique of the drinks is set at a high standard given B&T is named  a ""cocktail parlor"". I think they need to figure the ice situation out.  Each drink felt like a buffet of ice. Yes it sounds petty, but small ice melts fast and waters down the cocktail within a couple minutes.  The ""Old Fashioned"" quickly diminished in taste after a couple sips as a single large cube is preferred with any whiskey/bourbon drink.

Secondly, ordered a caipirinha that came out in a highball packed with ice that lost it's intensity within a few minutes.

Some of the barware seemed mismatched with the cocktail and there was even fruity drink served in a tall pilsner style glass that was reminiscent of TGIF.

Like all restaurants that open there are kinks to work out and the execution will improve with repetition.  I put the ambiance at 5 stars and cocktails at 3.5 stars.

Still some work to do to keep pace with the competitive cocktail culture in downtown.  Can't wait to figure out what their signature cocktail that they'll be known for."
ALn_0f-Usn3n0a9WBcjhhg,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,2,"Used to be a big fan until they cut down taxpayer trees. Food and drinks still good, but respect is out the window.  I wish them well, but lost my business. #phxfail"
ESinwiCgoJNG-tMWxVQhqQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"This young and budding restaurant is primed for great weather.  The open concept bar feels like it's been plucked straight from San Diego.  They have a great selection of craft beers on tap with local wines to boot.

Given the soft opening, they are still running friendly and timely service. They have an interesting concept of sushi and Vietnamese food out of the same kitchen.  Only thing that could top the Pho and hand roll duo would be a Pu Pu Platter.  The sushi bar is kicking out at full capacity, but still adding to the Vietnamese.

Have eaten here twice and been happy with the quality for the dishes.  Have tried the Lemongrass Chicken, Vermicelli with egg rolls, Fried Rice with pork, and the Pandora roll.

Will definitely be back to try the hammock chairs on the patio."

Kelly's steps up the Scottsdale atmosphere all at a great price point."

The museum does a great job of representing a diverse collection especially for Phoenix being such a young city compared to the east coast.

There is a fair mix of Contemporary, European, Southwest, and traveling exhibitions.  My favorites right now are:

Mass by Cornelia Parker
Chuck Close's portrait tapestry
You Who are getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama.

Wednesday nights are also free (voluntary donation) from 3-9pm [Courtesy of SRP]

Also went Easter Sunday and got in for free as Bank of America let's their customers in for free the first FULL WEEKEND of the month.  Nice little perk.

Would like to see more corporations and entrepreneurs donate to help the collection grow.  Hard to develop funds when so many people in the city have ties to the midwest or east coast then make their donations back east.

Downtown is a great time to invest as it's growing by leaps and bounds right now."

But there is just always something that steers me wrong.  This trip the waiter informed us that there was dairy in the marinara sauce....well just scratch the bulk of the menu for me.  Sure, Italian meals are heavily based around cheese, but there are very few other options on the menu as an entree.

Everyone else walked away happy...so I'm the odd man out.  I was in the mood for pasta and walked away only sampling guacamole, garlic bread, and nibbled on some sweet potatoes fries.  Would really like to see some more health conscious (lighter) options besides a 4lb salad.

Pros:
Busy and lively atmosphere
Huge portions (hopefully to take home)
Well priced
Great for families

Cons:
Always a wait
Feel like watching 'The Biggest Loser' afterwards"

Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,"At first glance, RnR is fresh, trendy, and part of the urban rebranding in Scottsdale.  There is ample seating at the bar, which is always a plus and a large patio.  I stopped by at lunch time and had fast/friendly service from the host and the girls behind the bar.

Another eye catcher was they serve breakfast until 2pm and the board out front seemed to have some decent happy hour specials.  A discount or special would be a plus.

The only concern seemed that the menu is a little pricey for the type of  food.  I tried the grilled chicken sandwich which is server on foccacia smothered with pesto and melted brie.  They do offer 3 different types of sides, parmesan fries, sweet potatoe fries, or chips.  Washed it down with a Coors light draft bringing a sandwich and a beer to $18 plus tip.

I'd be happy to go back for happy hour, but didn't think it was worth $21 bucks for lunch"
PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"What can I say...it was a really good happy hour.  This is definitely a place to be seen as there wasn't an empty table in the place.  Luckily we got seated right away on the patio...heat lamps included!

The waiter was able to keep up with the busy demand and made sure we were aware of the 2-for-1 happy hour!  The Fez Lettuce Wraps were a pleasant surprise.  Not the strong asian tastes that you most have come to love.  The Fez Lettuce wraps have a lighter taste with fruit and a light vinaigrette.

How do you say no to a rectangular burger?!  There are a wide variety of burgers and chicken sandwiches on the menu.  The Duxelles Burger was absolutely mouthwatering with sautéed mushrooms and onions...I skipped on the provolone cheese and it was still juicy.

Very trendy and great lighting inside."

Haven't been able to take advantage of happy hour or reverse happy hour yet, but the Tiger Roll keeps me coming back!

The Orange Chicken and Cucumber salad make for a nice addition to the sushi.

The chairs are visually pleasing they don't make you want to linger.  An hour and out is our motto."

_WvEXsx2eZ53lTWHlIx9kg,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Really liking the vibe here.  I like how the bar and lobby start to blend with a full house.  It is definitely a cocktail joint and the beer on tap continues to grow.  Have been about twice a week since they opened.

The food offers a wide variety to choose from and I like that many of the apps and entrees are created for a sharing environment. I've worked my way thru the menu pretty quickly.  Here's some suggestions:

*Starters*
Tater Tots
Deviled Eggs
Warm Mixed Nuts
Citrus Olives

Roasted Beets
Heirloom Tomato Salad (Tasty, but 3 slices was not worth the price)

*Main Dishes*
Mac N Chees
Short Ribs
(The gravy boat dish is cool, but the rib needs to be cut into smaller pieces)

*Dessert*
Cheese Cake with Tortilla Ice Cream
I'm not the biggest fan of dairy, but Tortilla Ice Cream is great!

All in all, I'm happy with the cocktails and apps at any hour.  You do pay for the upscale environment to be downtown, but I feel it's worth the experience.  The elevated view out of the windows is a spectacular over the city.

The biggest perk is you can head upstairs to Lustre's rooftop bar for a night cap.  You'll see a lot of the same staff working both bars.

I recommend for anyone especially the Scottsdale crowd before catching a game"
prdA1r8XP03oD-PYvZJ5AA,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,Nice addition to the airport.  Carnitas tacos are the way to go.  Plus a nice pull up bar while waiting on a flight.  Don't forget the black beans & rice in the to go cup:)
ToFm2DhhTdr0Kv0A7Sdj6g,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,"So was able to join Timo for a birthday party on the back patio.  The patio is wonderful once the sun goes down.  There is a great fire pit as well as some great back lighting.  The service was very friendly as they dealt with the hustle and bustle of a private event.

I like the over all feel of the place.  Very intimate inside as you can watch the cooks throw the flatbread into the wood fired oven.  The beer selection had a decent variety on NON-Anheuser Busch that plagues most restaurants, but would preferably like to see a couple other AZ breweries represented.  Luckily Four Peaks Hop Knot got me through the evening.

Ordered the Shortrib flatbread and later a Bruchetta plate that came out with three varieties.  The Shortrib was very appetizing with an accent of banana peppers. The Tomato was good as well as the Fig, but the Copa could use either a different supplier or switched to a Prosciutto...wasn't my favorite.

Overall we had a good evening and our friend enjoyed himself.  Only little tweaks were the bar ran out of some items, which proved the items were good I guess, and some of the drinks cocktails could have been a little stronger for the price.

All in all, it looks like a good addition to the North Phoenix"
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Saturday brunch on the patio!  St. Francis has been on the to do list since moving back to AZ.  I knew that I'd be impressed after reading that Chef Aaron Chamberlain came from La Grande Orange Hospitality.

We enjoyed a nice variety to keep everyone happy from a Turkey Scramble, Eggs Benedict, Fried Egg Sandwich, to a Traditional Breakfast with bacon.

To top it all off were their house cocktails. The Cucumber Cooler and freshly muddled blackberries made the Black Daisy the group favorites.

Enjoy the cozy architecture inside.  The cable lighting make you want to zip line straight to the bar!"
axZSFXdaJ0KE5auPwBllRQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,2,"So I've been a couple times as it's really close to the apartment and it's a local AZ business.  Food is comparable to an Applebee's quality.  Hat's off for quick and friendly service, but nothing ever seems extremely fresh.

I'm glad that they seem to be doing well as the place was pretty full for a lunch rush.  The best meal I've had was the Anaheim Scrambler for breakfast, which I've had a few times.

But today was inexcusable, I ordered the Club Panini...only two slices of thin deli meat!  Are you kidding me?!!!  I've seen 3rd graders make a better sandwich.  It ended up basically just being two big pieces of bread and mayo.

They do have WiFi, the coffee and desserts are pretty tasty.  The place does offer a bit of variety for the Arizona Center."
NPiLy71qqXzb45k9eQOgCQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Sunday afternoon and a packed patio is always a good sign of  great food or cheap drinks!  Maizie's delivered on both.  We were smart enough to sit at the bar and avoid the wait.  Our bartender was overly gracious for how busy the place was and she seemed to know everyone at the bar.  Lots of locals another great sign.

I didn't even have to look at the menu as there was already a pitcher of Bloody Mary's in front of me and the guy's plate next to me was insane.  Chicken Fried Steak was the special of the day.  Nice crispy potatoes with a large cut of steak doused in gravy and topped with two eggs.  I was stuffed the rest of the afternoon!

Come prepared to sit and soak up some rays on the patio and see many of smiling faces around you.  The food and environment are great."
FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"Bruchetta and wine!  The best part is that the food is ridiculously reasonable for superb quality food. The open restaurant concept keeps the place lively as there is always a good crowd soaking in the fresh air at the open bar or on the patio.

I've never had a bad experience here and the complimentary valet really helps as Magellan couldn't find you street parking.

Be sure to take a group of friends so you can sample as many types of bruchetta that you can.  My standard meal is the Autostrada sandwich and the Raspberry Chicken Salad (Half and Half deal for $9.75)

Indulge and always go for a bottle.  The light rail is just steps away."
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Food coma!  Lo-Lo's is consistent and comfort food for the soul.  We got lucky and their wasn't much of a wait to get seated.

Don't knock Chicken and Waffles until you try it!  I was skeptical the first time I heard about it, but I went to the grand opening of the Scottsdale location and I've been a fan ever since.

Don't hold back...go for the Lo-Lo's 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles and take left overs home with you.  Be sure to try the sides...my favorite is the Fried Okra."
2DUdvdQE8FOxCHHp59HHzw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"Bertha's completely over delivers! What an amazing find.

Stopped next door to get an oil change and didn't pay much attention as Bertha's is buried in the corner of the strip mall. But the place is very charming and inviting once you walk through the doors. Bring colors and copper pastry case are quick to catch your attention.

Best of all was the Brioche Egg Sandwich. Light and fresh ingredients...like the sandwich could just float away. Walked away completely satisfied.

Knew it was a great place the moment I sat down and realized all he casual business meetings happening at 9am. You can tell this is where people come to impress their clients.

Local business at its best!"
F-ULgBFmiSqG9udQmu6CCw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"Hummus, pita, dates, and Vimto!  Such a great place to add some variety in your grocery shopping.  Baiz really caters to the local neighborhood and provides great deals for fruit, veggies, spices, and pita!  Can you beat $.50 cent pita bread baked fresh daily?!

There is also a tasty restaurant to pick up shawarma, falafel, and all honey pistachio treats.

If you've ever been to the middle east....this will whisk you back to fond memories."
16fgi4_LNRlPGcpL1ObNww,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"So I haven't been able to find these guys on Yelp, so I'm adding them.  They are all over the Phoenix valley from the standard Food Truck nights down at the Phoenix Public Market to what seems like weekly food truck events popping up in Scottsdale, Mesa, Chandler...you name it.

I first tried them about a month ago on a Wednesday night at the Phoenix Public Market.  Wrapped with the guy a bit of how crazy the Scottsdale Street Eats was and that we got tired of battling for parking and turned away.  But I was glad I finally got to plate up.

Did it simple and just picked up a huge pork bbq sandwich smothered in coleslaw.  There was no way to eat this thing with my hands.  Luckily it is served with handy to-go fork and I sat down to dig in.  Massive sandwich for less than $8 and worth every penny.

Track them down at any of the events in the valley.  There is another Food Truck Festival tonight at the Phoenix Public Market if you're looking to track them down. Or find them on Twitter http://twitter.com/QupBBQ"
5DDumAHRKumv3gZiPKW6iw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"It's definitely a treat.  I got to split one with a friend after eating at Green and it was excellent.  A nice alternative for avoiding dairy.

Not sure of the flavor, but pretty sure it had bananas and cookies.  One is more than enough to share with multiple people especially after a meal.

Another great place in the central corridor"
TT2bNjvnVNFOanDNYnAffQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,1,"""Lowering Cane's expectations"" should be the name.

They have just set the bar low on food quality and taste.  No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezer.

Must not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him.  Just drove away disappointed.  Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intake.

Only positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty clean.

Don't waste your time."
m1Y47fK3vWCJXV3TdCn_Xw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,So happy to see them expand in the Valley. Stopped in for late evening meal. Tried one of the specials...Chicken Curry Salad. Great flavors. Nothing over powering. Beer was only $2 or something ridiculously cheap.
p-8AMN9Q0qwym-3Pdle20Q,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,How can you go wrong here?! The food is always greats quality. I can make a meal out if the Jalapeno Humus and the Fruit & Cheese plate. Good Happy Hour to sit out on the patio under the misters.  Probably my favorite local business in the Valley
HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Has become a weekend staple for breakfast or brunch, as the line out the door has shown increased patronage.  Most things on the menu are in the $10 range, whether breakfast or lunch.  DD has a great urban feel to the decor and lots of happy hour specials.

I'm a fan of the Daily Dose burger as you don't have to add ketchup or mustard.  The nachos are monstrous and glad to see a place still serve fruit as a side."
cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"I really enjoyed a casual Sunday afternoon at Windsor.  Don't get downtown too often, but really enjoy their sister restaurant Postino across the street.  Someone finally let us know that Windsor is in the same family.

Specialty cocktails was the perfect way to start the meal.  No 29 for the lady, but No 63 is definitely a gentleman's drink.  Bourbon just warms the soul.   Was really happy with the overall quality of the meal.  The chicken sandwich and the Brown Bag Chicken sandwich were great. Fav sides were the Kale salad and Broccoli with aioli...sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

The interior has an warm cozy feeling...especially since x-mas is right around the corner.  The outdoor patio would be great in warmer weather.

Ordered a 2nd round of drinks and then walked thru the back hallway to grab some cookies from Churn.  Stolled back to the cushy booth to relax with my drink and sweet.

All in all only ran about $50 for 4 drinks and 2 meals.  Wish I lived closer!"
yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,"I'm a big fan of FOX Restaurants, but just had an ok experience.  The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.

We decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.

The food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.

Our bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.

Overall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.

Oh, the Artichoke Hummus was the best part of the night.  Make sure to dip in."
PbTh7aX0_yyaXFOXAlhI4A,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,"Every neighborhood needs an Irish pub, right?!!!!

Turf is a solid 3.5 stars.  Nice choice of pints on draught and everyone needs a Black & Tan from time to time.  Always a lively environment and they had a good house band the night before St Patty's day.

Have only eaten once and tried Boxty for the first time. It was a good hearty meal and they have a dog friendly patio.

They also have off track betting...hence the name...which makes for a lively environment when the races are on.

Have always had friendly service even when we're the loudest people in the place.

Slainte!"
k4jX-Xe9dFu2pmdnlrcwgA,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"The anticipation for a new breakfast place downtown has delivered. My favorite aspect is right in the name and it all comes down to the vegetables. It's a nice open space as well the full service patio. Squash blossoms fits right into downtown including all the artwork on the walls for sale.

The variety of food is what impresses me. They serve breakfast and lunch as well as a coffee  & smoothie bar.

I like the warm colors of the atmosphere as it'll be a great spot to grab breakfast after shopping at the farmers market.

The egg and veggie scramble was very tasty.  Lots of onions, bell pepper, potatoes and tons of seasoning.  It was served with a slice of watermelon and a tidbit of carrot cake muffin.  I opted for the turkey sausage that's made in house as well.

This will be a continual staple for me as it's walking distance.  Can't wait for the full opening next week!"
hU6sN5r6vayqm_RMgvPGOQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,"Stopped by for happy hour and have never walked away so full on bread.  The bruschetta was tasty, but the size of Focaccia bread seems like it was ordered off the Super Size Me menu.  Also split the Pear Salad, which all the flavors were right, but just heavy on the dressing for our liking.

We'll definitely stop back, as some of the salmon dishes that came out to neighboring tables looked appetizing.  Prices were good for quality of food, but have to be willing to set down for a heaving meal as most French food falls in this category.

Also strange that there was no background music even though you could see speakers.

Glad to see another local downtown restaurant."
0LhYg3iOF9IU2Ut8IL84TQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,Very happy with the industrial vibe and open space. Wide variety of food choices from lamb meatballs to vegetarian Moroccan Tangia. Great service and location downtown on Portland park
yRvmDKX-Ocgd8zq_iMgujA,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"Downtown rooftop bar with one hell of a view from CityScape!  The temperature dropped enough to really enjoy sitting out and having drinks under the stars.  They do focus on specialty cocktails and you can kick it next to the rooftop pool as well.

Definitely a place to be seen.  The Kimpton has hit the spot with this location.  A must for anyone hitting up downtown.

Dive in with a Absinthe Fizz, You Call It, or a Swizzle.

Can't wait to go back."
cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Lived up to it's reputation on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  So many choices of meats and they'll let you sample as many as you'd like.  Served in a shiny aluminum take out dish and best served right into your belly!

Lots of food for like $8 or something ridiculous.  Great for a quick bite to eat."
j0_DUr3vBXY-JP-b0bf93A,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"All the reviews tell it straight! The 'What's a Burrito' was delicious. Ingredients amazingly fresh and succulent.  Very friendly staff and the use Square Up as their cash register ...which means you never have to pull your wallet out. Just smile and state your name then they'll email you your receipt!

Cartel is another great reason to be downtown"
TQxMhEar6--Wj4Du8nRQsw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,Easily here once a week for lunch or grabbing Drunken Noodles to go.  Very large portions and lots of spicy keep me happy.  Usually can split it into two meals so they great service will bring you a to go container.
LpHi2ooFxVn5Ntttw_IcaQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"This was my first time here after hearing such great things.  Didn't realize that they had multiple locations.  We showed up for brunch around 9:30am and were able to beat the crowd, luckily as we had 7 people.  Very relaxed posh setting with a great desert feel on the patio.

The Chiliequiles were very succulent...not that you get to use that word often!  Very simple dish, but the eggs and pulled pork are great on the tortillas.  They also had $5 mango mimosas and very spicy bloody marys.  I'll be happy to return again.

The brunch menu looked exactly the same as the normal menu.  Would like to see some specialties/variety or perhaps a deal like a dish and drink for $15.

Would be a great place for Mother's Day brunch"
fbQaKW0Lte0JQ_opbnjdKg,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,"A spicy 3.5 stars!  A good value and locally owned venture in central Phoenix.  Stopped in and tackled some tacos to go.  There was a wide variety of meat and veggie options.

Sampled the Short rib and Chile-pork tacos that both had a little zip to them.  The chicken tacos are the safest bet on the spicy barometer, but still flavorful.  The homemade flour/corn tortillas are a nice touch.  I'd take the staff up on the offer to melt the cheese in the wood fire stove as our food was a little cold when we got home.

I'll definitely go back to try some different combinations of meats and homemade salsas.

(Referring To-Go order) It seems that the packaging is a little over the top and wasteful - although beautifully done.  The food is served up in a circular aluminum foil pan, typical for Mexican fare, and then slid into an orange square sleeve for marketing purposes.  We had two dishes so they were then stuffed into a Spanish Inquisition styled contraption that then binds the two packages together.  While fun to watch the first time, it does slow down the line, then is annoying to cut off when you're to your destination and ready to scarf down.  All in all, I'd rather save the trees and the 45 seconds it takes to wrap them. (Perhaps change the packaging for the tacos as they we soggy when we got home)

The interior/exterior of the building are very contemporary, which adds to the allure of wanting to sit and have a beer with your meal. It makes a great alternative to Chipotle and your dollars stay local.  A few fine tweaks and it could easily be a 5 star experience:)"
J07TDs6qnTIaxm48EL1cKQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Makes me want to time travel back to the 60's and sip tropical cocktails overlooking a volcano.  Hula's has to be in one of the most unique buildings in Phoenix.  I recommend sitting at the bar to check out all the memorabilia exploding from every crevice.

Our bartender was jovial and uniquely looked like the Mayhem guy from the All State commercials.  Very fresh ingredients and the Sweet Potato Fries are banging.

There are a variety of house cocktails and I stumbled out a Tiki Bastard!  Gin is my new poison."
4vkOZ0kW4Hor43XqqNc0Og,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Update - Have become a regular and love the Cashew Chicken.  Good service and great for take out.

-----
So first time to any of the Thai Basil's around the valley.  It's a nice downtown location on Adams and Central.  I grabbed my order to go, but they had a good happy hour special that I didn't get to take advantage of since it was take out.  There was a bottle of Mekhong sitting on the bar, which sounds like a spiced rum, and the special was the Mekhong Ginger Lime Long-Tail.  Will try next time.

As for the food, the Cashew Nut had a rather zesty flavor especially on the backend, but I ordered it medium spicy and it fell way short.  The over all tast was good and comes with rice.

But the Pad Thai, I think they need to go back to the drawing board.  Very bland and didn't really activate the palette at all.  Almost like they only used half the seasonings.  It did have mushrooms, green beans, carrots, cabbage, and maybe some bean sprouts on the plus side.  Portion size was large, but really need to double down on the seasoning and spices for that large of a portion.

The service was very friendly and accommodating while the decor was inviting.  I'll definitely give it another try, but shoot for something a little more exotic like a curry or drunken noodle.

Always willing to give a second chance."
aXsmmtepl0JZNcl3pkXqww,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"Very happy with the sandwiches and I'm not the biggest sandwich fan.

I had the Van Gogh minus the cheese.  The ingredients and pumpernickel bread were extremely fresh.  I needed to add an extra topping to replace the cheese maybe some peppers to compliment the deli mustard.

Also tried a bite of the Impressionist where you get to pick two cheeses with loads of veggies on top of the 12 grain bread. Here, I think they might want to make some recommendations of complimentary cheeses since they have so many.  Also, the bread seemed a little firm and dry (I'm a fan of softer breads).  Maybe not the freshest loaf of the day, but still tasty

Overall it was a great deal and a packed lunch crowd.  Lots of teas to choose from if you want to skip the sodas

Oh and the mini cookies are a great treat to end the meal!!!"
tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,4,"You know, it's taken me a longer time to jump on the PF Chang's bandwagon than everyone else.  I'm such a fan of takeout chinese, which Chang's isn't in the same class, but I've finally come around in the past couple years.

Chang's does wonderful job on flavors of sauces and meats.  The apps are really good as well.  We loaded up this past visit, of course everyone starts with the Lettuce Wraps, but the new Tuna Tataki Crisps and Flaming Red Wontons are great additions to the menu.

I don't think I've ever really had a dish I didn't like.  The Spicy Chicken and the new Caramel Mango Chicken were tops for the day.  The Sichuan Shrimp were impressive in size and flavor.

They all got washed down with Dark & Spicy's, Yuzu Ginger Mojitos, and Coconut Lemon Sours.

Finally to pig out we split the Chocolate Dome and Banana Spring Rolls!  Walked out sleepy with big ole' smiles and feeling to need to check our blood sugar!

Darn good thing we're all runners!

(Overall, the menu is so large that at times I have a hard time finding a new dish that would satisfy my meat and veggie craving.  I know that you can add veggies to any dish and you can add meat to any veggie dish.  I usually skip the rice all together.  Would be happy to see a veggie lo mein or something instead of the rice)

Have fun picking thru the menu!!!!"
ndXuzuD4BpNIrm1I0nTsww,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,3,"Checking out the $20 brunch

Go for the ambiance and bring a camera.  It's a fun field trip to try to find or even get into the Saguaro Hotel.  They've done a great job renovating the entire property and has the feel of a big resort.  That being said...it feels like a big resort...not a lot of people around.  It would actually be a great place to film a zombie movie!

We were one of three tables in the place as they had just opened and took probably 20 minutes to get our food.  Unless we're at a Luau and you have to pull the pig out of the ground...I'm just saying there' not enough chips and salsa to keep me happy.

Our server was great and chatty through the whole process.  We originally tried to go to the Scottsdale Street Eats food truck festival, which turned out to be a gong show.  So Distrito was our final destination.  Brunch is served with a small app and your main dish for $20. It ends up being a mountain for food after the chips and salsa for a starter.

I'd recommend just splitting an appetizer and I think they do an entree/beer deal.

Food was good/fresh, but they'll have to work hard to start drawing a crowd in"

Exploring craft beers can be a tricky game...we've all ordered a beer that didn't fit our palette and you have to WORK your way thru it.  I explored 3 styles of beers I'd never tried and then finished with 3 favorites to satisfy the taste buds.

There was a nice variety of food on the menu.  They have an interesting take on wings with the sauce on the side. Tried one of the salads which was tasty, but left you a little hungry...especially since it was the same price as the wings.  That moved us onto the Sweet Potato Tacos, which area little more like empanadas, but really tasty with a pesto dipping sauce.

Living in the southwest for so long I'd like to some type of hot sauce on the table or a homemade concoction to bring the heat.

The noise is a little loud, but they'll get the acoustics figured out.  The openness of the floor plan and windows will make it a great year round place for a pint.  It's smack dab in the middle of the Evans Churchill district which is great for a pub crawl"
STtrEGylaYOXoXQFLP5OAQ,ucj0RT3ZsWHFXQssLq-wmQ,5,"3 years downtown and Breadfruit & Rum Bar is still my favorite restaurant downtown. The closest experience I can get to being back in NYC. Always fresh ingredients and locally sourced veggies.

The mood and environment can't be found anywhere else in Phoenix. The scallops are still my favorite appetizer. While the seasonal drink and entree menu keep the experience new.

But favorites are the Pork Belly, Red Stripe Shrimp, and Street Style Chicken are always consistent. The Yellow Tail catch of the day was phenomenal.

Relax, enjoy freshly made drinks, with edible condiments. Perhaps have a cigar in the courtyard (even with misters in 90 degree heat at night).

It's a tried and true downtown Phoenix experience."
xQtCOQIwrGIiDeHWVHdkBw,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,4,"I've been meaning to pop in here for a while since I work in the area and finally got a chance with today.

I am vegan and my girlfriend is vegetarian, so we were happy to find lots of wonderful sounding food. Not being able to decide on what to eat was a nice change from trying to find something I CAN eat!

The only criticism I have about the food is that I found the quinoa salad a bit salty and was not a fan of the sweet potato fries' dipping sauce. I guess I'm a ketchup guy, but that's not exactly health food.

Service was a bit slow, but they got busy really quick. I'm sure it was a result of the busy mall/holiday traffic.

It is very reasonably priced for fresh, healthy and organic food and would definitely recommend it to anyone with a special diet or anyone into health foods."
6Z3lZEEIKv6opbyavmnGbA,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,5,"I popped into Monkey Pants for my first time not long ago. I guess the best way to describe the environment is gloriously tacky. It was Christmas time so they had lights up, including the sexy leg lamp thingy from ""A Christmas Story"", a wood fireplace on TV and they were building a beer can Christmas tree. Picture the biggest beer castle ever. From the floor to the ceiling. Yes, gloriously tacky is a wonderful description.

The music her was mostly country and rock. Sorry, Lady Gaga fans. The crowd was very mixed. It seems many people from many different backgrounds come here to bask in Monkey Pants' soft, tacky glow. The drinks specials were good, the waitstaff was very attentive, and they had many TVs with various sports events on.

One of the coolest things about Monkey Pants is the boardgames. Who doesn't want cheap drinks and Battleship? I dare ye find such a man.

I didn't get a chance to look at the menu, but as a vegan bar food for me usually means peanuts or french fries."

My first long overdue visit was extremely satisfying. The owner Sahsa was extremely helpful and gave us a little insight into how 24 Carrots became what is it to day. You can tell she is really passionate about the food and drink she dishes out to her guests.

My girlfriend and I went in for lunch this past Saturday and were able to get an extremely satisfying meal for a fair price. We tried the French toast (which was a special) that had kiwi, pomegranate seeds, cashew cream and real maple syrup on it. All 100% vegan and 100% percent. We also tried the eggs benedict which came with homemade vegan bacon, avocado, vegan egg (it even had a ""yolk"" and aioli. Definitely a stunner.

Our Peachy Keen smoothie was also a healthy and delicious way to start off our meal.

For the price, the portion size, the quality, the friendliness and atmosphere I give 24 Carrots a 5 out of 5 and look forward to coming here again be it for breakfast, lunch or just to grab a fresh juice."

You can't reach the bar easily and apparently the lines to as well as the condition of the bathroom was bad.

PaYHG4FkH4-tUX_wfYEbcg,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,1,"Editing my review. I originally gave Zoe's 3 stars, but on my third visit I ended up having one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I'm typically not a person that will completely write off a restaurant based on one bad experience but I think sometimes it is completely understandable.

I'll start off by saying on all 3 of my Zoe's experiences I ordered the grilled vegetable kebabs. Not bad, but they are not great. And extremely overpriced, to boot. The item is marked ""vegan"", but the salad it comes with is topped with feta cheese, which makes it not vegan. Zoe's needs to take their ""V"" off this item because if it wasn't for the fact that I emailed Zoe's corporate email prior to my first visit, I would have been stuck with an inedible salad. Besides, vegans are smart enough to ask questions about menu items that are not clearly marked vegan. Just don't give them false security by labeling non-vegan food ""vegan"" because then we'll feel we don't need to ask questions.

In short, what happened last experience was I ordered ""grilled vegetable kebabs"" and ended up with a plate of big, stinking, chicken kebabs. A sight not pleasing to most vegans and vegetarians and frankly, quite offensive to ethical vegans and vegetarians. It's not a ""choice"" for me, it's a belief and a lifestyle. This is the equivalent to serving a steak to a Hindu, or a rack of ribs to a Jew.

Anyways, server takes my beans off the plate and takes the plate back to get me my kebabs. Mind you, the chicken kebabs cost more than the vegetable ones but I figured getting my money back would be more hassle than it's worth. 15 minutes pass. My beans go cold as I patiently wait the return of my food and pita for which to eat said beans. In a flurry of apologies and napkins, my server arrives with my plate. By this point I've already decided I'm not coming back here ever again. But the cherry on top is there are little bits of feta cheese in my salad.

Done and done. There are some mistakes that are unforgivable."

From what I gathered upon my first visit, there are two ways you can eat at Tsom. First, you can load up your plate from the buffet (think couscous, quinoa, beans, hummus, baba ganouj, greens etc.) or you can try out one of their hot, made-to-order items from the menu at the counter.

I went with the buffet. They price what you get by the pound and I was able to get a pretty hefty plate of goodness along with a toasted wheat pita for under 6 bucks.

The food didn't exactly ""wow"" me, but it was decent. I think for many vegans and vegetarians in the valley we eat so much quinoa and hummus it's not exactly new or exciting so sitting down for a meal at Tsom was just that: a meal. Not a real treat, if you get my drift. I also felt that the some of the items from the buffet were a little salty or could use some tweaking in the flavor. But, I guess Tsom is new so it has plenty of time to adjust its menu and/or seasoning.

I didn't get a chance to try any of their made-to-order items, but I will update my review when I get a chance to try them. The menu offered pastas, wraps, pita pockets and several (yes, several) types of falafel. As with the hummus, quinoa etc. I've had my share of falafel. Not exactly something to get excited over, but I may give it a shot next time. They did have a little falafel-bar type thing with all sorts of veggies (I believe I saw some lovely pickled turnips calling me) and sauces to dress your falafel with.

So, Tsom doesn't really offer a heck of a lot of new or exciting foods for the vegan/vegetarian community (especially in that part of town) but the value is great and they certainly have time evolve."
F6981E_sIQLhPzImbBagAQ,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"I came here after hearing that they began offering Beyond Meat chicken-less strips. You can substitute this for any of the chicken dishes on the menu, from what I understand. Speaking of the menu, the one hanging behind the counter doesn't give much of a description so it made ordering a touch difficult. I chose to go with the thai chicken wrap. It was, in fact, quite good. Toasted on the outside and sliced in half. My only gripe was that one half seemed a to hold all the sauce and the other had little to none."
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,5,"Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ ""Chicken"" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.

The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.

Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.

Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. ""Turkey"", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend."
UPF6nUKB_kbMM44xiEc66g,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,1,"Went here on a Tuesday night and it was packed! Had some stir-fried mushrooms which were excellent and ordered the black tea noodle thingy. I had thought it came with baked tofu (which it does now that I look at the online menu) and we asked the server about it. She said she would find out and let us know. She never came back with tofu or to tell us if I was wrong. So, I didn't get what I ordered and the server never bothered to fix the mistake.

My girlfriend got the Vegetable Chow Fun which she said was flavorless. She took it home and ended up making a miso sauce to give it flavor. Between the two of us we spent around $40 and left disappointed. For what you pay, not worth it. I'd rather pay $7.50 for some Orange Tofu from Chopstick Express."
Kb1x5axfTQYrndJDZzj0bw,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"I've been here a few times for a quick bite and am not impressed.

You are going to end up paying Chili's price for a burger, but with drive-thru quality. If they toast your bun, consider yourself lucky. If your fries are hot, consider yourself lucky. If your burger fix-ins aren't spilled out all over your plate like a gutted pig when you get it, consider yourself lucky.

This joint definitely needs to work on quality and consistency."
0ebavvJVXAzKKQ8C9cOt6g,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,4,"As a full-time worker, a bachelor, and a vegan Chopstick Express is a a great quick fix for me on busy weeknights. The prices are fair and while their tofu dishes may not be the healthiest thing in the world, they sure are tasty!

The orange tofu is a favorite, but I'll go for the general tso is probably my favorite. They'll even make sweet and sour tofu (not on the menu) if you just ask them.

Also, the egg(less) rolls are allegedly vegan, so dig in!

Final vegan note, the woman on the phone told me that she thought there was egg in the chow mein noodles, but if you're vegan you know how flaky people can be about whats in what so I'll definitely have to ask again some time.

Edit: Worst. Fortune. Cookies. EVER! My cookie told me the equivalent to ""water is wet"".

nzV7HlERvD_v1DEfL_oiGQ,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"At this point, I think I've tried just about all the vegan options at Pita Jungle and while they are not great, they are better than nothing.

The falafel pita is probably your best bet and perhaps the spinach pasta salad some in 2nd. The falafel platter has a strange, strange presentation. Rather than serving the falafels with sauce and veggies on the side, they serve it up like a big salad. A big salad is not an appetizer, it's an entree. And by big, I mean BIG. Only about 5 or 6 falafels, but a ton of greens. The grilled veggie burrito doesn't have very great flavor. A lot of ginger, but not much of anything else. The thing that bothered me most about this item was that they rolled the foil *into* my burrito. So, the only way I could eat the thing was by tearing the burrito apart and trying to remove the foil from my food. This resulted in a mess. Fix this, Pita Jungle. It also bums me that the vegan options are so meager. If they just offered vegan bread and lavosh I'd be able to try more of the items. I'd love the portabello burger or the veggie burger. Alas, dairy.

At least I can say that the P.J. staff is very attentive and friendly. The wine menu is good, you have waterfront-ish dining and on Thursday nights they have live jazz."
sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"I was really excited to try out Tott's after hearing so many good things about it, but now it is doubful I will be returning..

Here's the thing, the only vegetarian item on the menu is the Szechuan Tofu and Vegetables. A dish that is ""meh"" at best.

All the others have either chicken powder (WTF?), oyster sauce or both, thus making 'em not suitable for vegetarians.

Also: Was told the spicy tofu was veg the first time I tried Tott's. Found out it was not on the second.

The bummer is, these are ingredients that could easily be subbed or omitted.

Nowadays, the vast majority of Chinese restaurants are very accommodating to (the growing population of) vegetarians. It is easy to substitute meat with tofu and have the kitchen leave the animal ingredients out. Tott's fails to make the effort.

If you are in the area and are looking for great take-out Chinese that is super accommodating to vegetarians, than I recommend a certain ""Express"" not too far North of Tott's. You won't be disappointed."
wu5nk3pY1e_ou_Le_U52Sw,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,4,"I'm  going to go out on a limb and say outside my dinky half-pint kitchen, Cheba Hut offers the best subs in the area.

One would think, ""Oh Cheba Hut is all about the ambiance. You are paying for the experience, not the food"". But to that I say, ""Nay, good Sir. Cheba Hut subs doth rock mine socks.""

As other reviews stated, the subs are named after different kinds of weed and the sizes are nugs (4""), pinners (8"") and blunts (12""). There's tacky weed stuff everywhere. Very ""groovy"" to say the least.

The subs are toasted (on white, wheat or garlic herb bread) and loaded up with all sorts of interesting ingredients. No boring sammies here, unless you so choose (looking at you, ham and swiss dude).

I recently had my first vegan sub at Cheba Hut and it was AMAZING! I had my girlfriend build me what I affectionately call ""The Angie"". It was a Majic Mushroom (teriyaki portabello) with pineapples, onion, fresh mushrooms, sprouts, cucumbers, bell pepper, greek dressing, tomato and probably some other stuff I can't remember.

Amazing!

The only thing that creeps me out about Cheba is that you can't see your sandwich as they're making it. I worry that the line is really dirty or that they are flossing my bun with a strip of bacon. It kind of adds to the experience though because you don't know how your Cheba Hut creation will look until it's right in front of you.

The place does get kind of loud, so be prepared.

Also, they used to deliver but according to Yelp they don't...so something to look into.

It would be a shame if stoners had to get behind the wheel in order to get their Cheba Hut fix."
bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"I had to go back and update my review for Cafe Krisha, as I have made several more visits since my original posting.

Cafe Krisha has been open for a while and has still failed to supply guests with a menu that marks what items are suitable for vegans.

At vegetarian restaurants, a menu that marks what is vegan is not just a convenience, it is a standard. Cafe Krishna stands virtually alone in the Phoenix as the only vegetarian restaurant that fails to offer this.

This wouldn't be an issue if servers were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free. Getting a confirmation that a menu items are dairy-free from the servers feels like pulling teeth, and I making people's lives more difficult makes me feel uncomfortable. I just want to sit down and eat with no worries.

A simple ""V"" next to all the vegan items would make me feel more inclined to eat at Cafe Krishna, it would make me feel more certain about what I was eating, and it would make the lives for the servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time I (and every other vegan) have a question about dairy in my food.

That aside, the food at Krishna can be quite good. I've had crispy, spicy gobi manchurian here and I've had mild, crumbly gobi manchurian. The rasam and sambar is always good. And the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet. I had my first experience with uttapam here, and it was quite good but I'll be sure to ask for no raita next time!

So, Cafe Krishna, mark the vegan items, and work on a little consistency and you could easily outscore any other Indian join in town."
pxpLVCInGwLClbnwJwxInw,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,4,"I've been coming to Tut's for at least 7 years now. Very little bad I have to say about it. Hookah and drinks always come out in a timely manner and the staff is always quite attentive. They'll make sure you get fresh coals and a new bowl if your hookah needs it.

And I absolutely love the upper seating area. The only place in the valley where you'll see me excited to sit on the floor. Get yourself a hookah, some arabic coffee, a nice corner with some friends you'll be set.

They have some screens that they show sports and stuff on and they play music (mostly pop, some middle eastern) but if you're friends you probably won't be paying much attention to it.

The only food I've ever had was the grape leaves. It was OK. Seemed like it had been sitting around for a while and I didn't like that it came out with yogurt sauce as I am vegan. It's the only place I've ever seen this done and I've eaten my share of grape leaves.

Admittedly, I haven't been to many hookah bars, but Tut's is so great I don't see why I'd go anywhere else. Don't fix something if it ain't broken.

Oh, and free wifi. Just saying."
qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,4,"This was my long-overdue first visit to P.F. Chang's and it was very satisfying. Went for lunch on a Friday and it was not very busy at all.

I'll get into the food in a bit, but first I have to applaud Chang's for their amazing service. Not only were they super-attentive and friendly but they helped us out so much. The thing is, my girlfriend is vegetarian and I am vegan so it's often hard to find a decent meal at restaurants that cater primarily to meat-eaters. We let our server know our dietary concerns and he was zipping back and forth to the kitchen (unbidden, mind you!) to find out what all was vegan. Usually when I dine out and ask ""Does this have _____ in it?"" or ""Is this vegan?"" I get an odd look and an unsure ""Yeah...that's totally vegan..."". It's hard to enjoy a meal when you aren't confident that there isn't some sort of strange animals bits lurking in it. You'd have to adhere to understand, but trust me. It sucks when you can't enjoy your food because there is that concern in the back of your mind.

Now on to the food...

We started with the tofu lettuce wraps which I had heard great things about. They were a bit salty for my tastes, but still very good. The addition of a crisp, cool sesame slaw would have taken this dish to the next level, but that's just me.

For the main course I got the coconut curry and my girlfriend got the ma po tofu. The coconut curry had all kinds of colorful vegetables and tofu topped with peanuts. It was alright, but no where near the same quality curry you'd get from Thai Basil or Swadee or Touch of Thai. But that's to be expected. After all, it's not a Thai restaurant.

The ma po tofu was HUGE. Large, sweet and saucy chunks of tofu wreathed in broccoli. Of the three things we tried, this was my favorite.

Oh, and they offer brown rice! Thank goodness because American really needs to get on the Whole Grain Train.

So there you have it. The vegan food is enough for me to *want* to return, but the great service pretty much guarantees that I will. I just hope the Chang's across the street from me in Chandler can match this location! If so, I'd be stunned.

UPDATE: Since posting this review I've visited both the Chandler and Tempe Chan'gs. Of the three Scottsdale is by far the best. Chandler location completely lost my business when they mixed chicken in with my tofu. Unacceptable."
U_x3Ryer88VwUlqa71Np-g,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"If this were a review for the Chandler or Tempe Pita Jungle, I'd give a solid 4 stars. But, Pita Jungle's food court cousin unfortunately falls short of that mark. I come here from time to time because it's close to my work, fairly healthy and fairly priced. But, the food just isn't up to par. I almost always go with one of their pita sandwiches and by god, if it's not a gamble each time. Sometimes it will be warm, crunchy and full of crisp vegetables. Other times, it's a stale pita filled with wilty lettuce. If I was a high-end manager @ Pita Jungle I'd take their food from any of there sit-down restaurants and share it with their food court staff so that they know what their food is *supposed* to look and taste like. It's easy to tell when food is just sloppily thrown together with little regard, and that's make for an unpleasant meal. But, I guess, if you are looking for a $6 grab-and-go meal, Pita Jungle beats the hell out of most of Fashion Square's food-court options."
2lF1UsGcDpDpaI1lXgRX_g,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"Not vegan/vegetarian friendly at all. The beans have bacon in them. The server was able to hook it up with some veggie fajitas, off the menu, but still not exactly the kind of thing I would really want to pay money for.

Felt a bit sick after words, so my assumption is that either the food was tainted or that I accidentally ate some sort of animal protein that my body is not able to digest well.

The only reason why I'm not giving Abuelo's is because my server was super helpful in finding me something to eat."
Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.

This place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this.

According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).

The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.

Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas."
wN2zNgEK-QizEA_NKAHj6Q,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,4,"What the heck is the vegan doing at a sushi bar? Eating kick ass sushi!

This is my second experience dining at Ra and it was a good one! The veggie rolls are great. Stuffed with avocado and asparagus and super delicious. My only complaint is that our rolls fell apart, a problem that my girlfriend has had in the past here and that we did not encounter at Ra's Old Town Scottsdale location.

I was notified that the vegetable tempura rolls were also vegan, except that they are fried in the same oil as poultry and seafood. There was no noticeable fish and/or chicken taste so it's edible, IMO. This had squash (I think) and eggplant and was served with an eel sauce (V).

It was really loud, being late night on a Friday. But our server was very helpful. It is pricey, though! Each roll we got was $6-7 and when you add a sake bomber you're looking at an expensive night. Looking forward to going back for happy hour some day."
426RL7G7oTyu-f8jFxVRJQ,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"I like Chipotle because they have great vegetarian options, but this one is an exception. I have been here twice and both times were a less than satisfactory experience. I feel that they skimp on the ingredients. I get far more food at other Chipotles than I do this one. For example, the one at Chandler mall always leaves me feeling well fed. The people are nice enough, but there is a sense that they what you to be in and out as quickly as possible that turns me off. I don't understand why this location got so many good reviews."
ibkwcLZwaJ1pnPJVaI_-uA,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"When I think of Thai food, I think of Swadee. Swadee was sort of my introductory restaurant into the world of Thai food. I've gone with many friends and family her over the years and they all have been satisfied.

So it pains me to write a bad review, but the last couple experiences I've had at Swadee have required me to bid Swadee adieu.

The first bad experience I ordered the Larb Tofu. The dish was so salty I couldn't finish it. It literally tasted like the cap fell off the soy sauce bottle and they dumped  several cups of the stuff in the pan/wok. Even if they didn't, it was pretty much inedible. Inedible in the same way a salad swimming in vinaigrette is.

The second occurred during a visit with my girlfriend. We are both vegetarians and took great care to make sure that the dishes we ordered were meat (and fish sauce, and chicken broth) free. Those ingredients can upset a vegetarian's stomach if it's been a while since they ate meat (or if they've never eaten it).

Well, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai (carefully made veg) and she found a piece of chicken in her dish. To most this would not be a big deal, but to us chicken isn't considered food and it taints the food it was cooked with. As a result she lost her appetite and it made me feel uneasy about what might be in my own meal. Our lovely Valentine's Day dinner came to a screeching halt.

And as a side note they have a dish with oyster sauce listed on their vegetarian menu. Since when is an oyster a vegetable? The only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom!

I understand that there is always a risk for cross contamination and I expect it when I dine out. But this occurance is far more than just cross contamination. I mean, this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird. It makes me feel uneasy about the level of cross contamination that takes place in Swadee's kitchen.

The staff was kind enough to comp the tainted Pad Thai (which accounts for the ** instead of *) but I don't believe you'll see me walking into Swadee any time in the foreseeable future."

OoYwJANV9zD-_OA4Atu-gg,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"In reality more like a 3.5 stars. I've been by this place many times and I was finally able to give it a go. Rather than ramble on about ambiance, the service, the location I'll cut right to what matters: the food. I'm a vegetarian and as such I accept that my dining options are not as vast as those with unrestricted diets. However, Asian cuisine is generally very veg friendly and as such I dine at Asian restaurants probably more than any other type of restaurant. Unfortunately, Republic Ramen falls a touch short of what I'd call ""Veg Friendly"". The only option you'll have is the Vegetarian Ramen, which is OK because that is what I came in there for. And while the ramen was good (very rich, salty and tons of toppings) one dining option is not enough to make me a regular. It would be nice to try, say some udon noodles or an appetizer that isn't edamame.

Again, the ramen is good. And the price is fair. But would it really be so bad to leave the fish sauce out of a dish or two? Or to try using a vegetarian dashi instead of a fish-based dashi?"
KfuNW67ZM3jegHT4txnHbg,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"I was not impressed with Touch of Thai, but it was still pretty good. I had the tofu red curry. Unlike some other Thai joints in town (namely Thai Basil and Swadee) they deep fry their tofu and then throw it in with the curry sauce and give it a drizzle of coconut milk. Our server was a nice enough guy, but nothing to write home about.

They do have a separate vegetarian menu, but I would prefer that it was incorporated with the regular menu. Also I believe they had something like fish sauce or oyster sauce on the vegetarian menu as well, worries me about what their concept of vegetarian is.

So, it was a  nice enough experience but I don't see myself going back."
0TBTV3q6QXCn9vNhy3Xi2w,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"Seems there are only 2 Ethiopian restaurants in Tempe and I've now officially been to both. Unfortunately, Lalibela will have to settle for being 2nd best.

I cam here with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day last week. It was our first time to Lalibela, but we're no strangers to Ethiopian food. So, we made reservations, were quickly brought to our table and everything was swell.

They offered a Valentine's day menu, so we ordered the vegetarian special. It was about $36 and was allegedly a meal for two. Odd, because on their regular menu they have a meal for 3 at $38. In retrospect, we probably should have paid the extra $2 and taken home more leftovers. More bang for your buck.

Either way, it's a pretty steep price for Ethiopian food. Most of which is very cheap to make as our meal was mostly peas, lentils, potatoes, salad and cabbage.

We also got a bottle of Yellow Tail merlot @ ~$18. Both our food and our wine came out very quickly. And that was pretty much the last time we saw our server for the rest of the meal.

I will hand it to Lalibela, the food is good. Very good. Perhaps even better than Blue Nile. But the price is steep and the lack of service really spoiled the night for us. It's not as if the place was busy. By the time our meal was finished there was only 3 other tables with patrons at them but none of them were receiving any service. Sure, we knew there were waitresses. We could hear them talking in the kitchen so they must exist! After maybe 15-20 minutes of sitting waiting on our check, empty water and no service to speak of I actually had go up to the front desk and wave down our waitress. This is completely unacceptable for any restaurant. Short of an emergency, there is no reason why a dining room should be left unattended for 15 minutes while there are guests. My feeling was that the servers got their food out and that's all that mattered. No ""How's the food?"" no refills on waters. Nothing.

On top of that, Lalibela's menu lacks the diversity of Blue Nile. Not only does Blue Nile have great veg options, but they have sambusas, hummus, falafel, salads and a raw vegan menu. Lalibela just has about a dozen or so meat and vegetable dishes. Likely all that could be found at Blue Nile for a much lower price.

I can understand why people come here. The food is good (the injera is certainly better than Blue Nile's), but the lack of service and the price are enough to keep me out of Lalibela for good."
QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"As a vegan and  a local I knew I had to try Pomegranate Café. And while I am thrilled to have another vegan-friendly restaurant in my area I can't help but feel disappointed.

We went in here for breakfast not long ago and the joint had a nice atmosphere and the staff was super friendly.

Here's the thing, though. While I was satisfied with just a fresh (moderately priced) vegetable juice, my girlfriend wanted to try their avocado sandwich. This thing runs you $7.50 and is tiny! More a bite than an actual breakfast, this item was definitely not worth it. Perhaps their other menu items have larger portions, and I would be more than willing to try Pomegranate Café again. But for my money, I'd much rather go down the road to 24 Carrots for breakfast."
-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,3,"A modest little place worth checking out. Very clean, nice interior. It seems that Indian restaurants have either an over the top design with big floral drapes and bronze whatnots, or they'll be a bit on the trashy side. 80's, diner style tables and Bollywood TVs. Chutney's was right in the middle. Comfortable, inviting.

I love that they mark what is and isn't vegan which is something a lot of Indian restaurants don't do which can make ordering a pain in the butt. Especially if the servers don't have very good english.

I had the veg vindaloo which was very good. A bit more watery than the vindaloo I'm used to, but it's forgivable. I really like a thick gravy in all my curries, which this didn't really have. The spice level was perfect. Lots of crisp cauliflower and toothsome potatoes & chickpeas. This would easily be a 4 star if not for 2 things:

a.) Despite the dinning area being near abandoned, service was slow. I was in for perhaps 15 minutes before I got my drink order in. There's really no excuse for that.
b.) They didn't bring me rice with my vindaloo. We ordered 3 curries and only two plates of rice came out.

So, there you have it. Perhaps I came in on a bad night, but I feel the wait staff could use some improvement. With that, I think it could be one of the best Indian joints in the valley. I'll be returning and will adjust my review accordingly."
XHviODj3T9hesQPDGdPE1g,Mk9ekByCVSifYjfPty8kIw,2,"Good place to drink. Can't say the same about the food, though. Feeling hungry I asked our server if the veggie burger had dairy or eggs in it. So, he exhales and rolls his eyes like I just asked him to help me move or something. He comes back a few minutes later and says, ""The veggie burger might have dairy and eggs in it."" Well, if I wasn't concerned about it I wouldn't have asked. He tells me ""You should just eat it"". Like I'm going to eat something that nobody knows whats in it? I emailed Teakwoods, too and spoke with a woman who said she'd let me know about the contents of the veggie burger. After a week or so and no response I sent another email. No response.

d7ozMWbBwcFOkHM3zmktfA,mz9vD8jY9NBlGB3RQ_4UHg,2,"The restaurant was super clean and the server was friendly. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken off the menu. It was terrible. The chicken definitely wasn't fresh. It almost had a rubbery texture to it. The best part of that dish was the steamed rice...and that's nearly impossible to mess up. I also ordered the Green Tea Icecream for dessert and it was good. Overall, I won't be eating at Ahi again. You can find much better food elsewhere."
seYvTmOZGJ2IAMdfQa8pkg,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,4,Great patio good atmosphere! The staff is pretty friendly. I would love to come here for happy hour [wine bar 12-7]. the chai tea is good. The only negatives: the pastries are a bit bland and the service is a tad on the slow side.
47JJtwt6vhyYa5Z-mAFv7A,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,4,"This place is delicious. The atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly and attentive. I had a foie gras and mushroom appetizer ( sooo good), and the Kobe burger, which was one of the best I've had. My wife had the crab cakes. I don't even like seafood, but I liked these crab cakes. The only negative: they don't have desert. Or at least none they are proud of. When I asked the waitress what their deserts were, she said ""we don't really have any. We have a cookie. There is a pie place right down the way."" Overall great place."

Came here on a Saturday night for some preseason football, but they only had two games playing.  They got my order of wings wrong, but quick to redeem themselves with $5 ""Zipps bucks. "" the wings were tasty with plenty of meat on them. The service was friendly. Probably wouldn't come back just because there's better places for wings and football."
hNsRj2nXuALlJS4Op-8MmA,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,3,"This place is the epitome of mediocrity. The food is the same quality as Applebee's. In fact, the wings and burgers at Applebee's are better. I like my ground meat well done *if you know what I mean* and they couldn't even get that right. The only saving grace is the atmosphere and the nice staff. The staff is pretty quick, even on Friday at 730pm.  The happy hour is not great if you're a beer drinker ( only $1 off ). And for some reason the whole place smells like wet pennies."

Cons: 1.only valet parking on Saturday (maybe all the time, I've only been on Saturday) 2. the hipster staff is just nice enough to get the 15% tip they deserve ( no I didn't leave that bad of a tip but they really don't deserve more)"
JLWd6yDyt9oEp70_4KqYeg,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,4,Atmosphere is nice. Staff is very friendly. Food is good.

The music kinda sucks too.

I gave it 3 stars because there is better Greek food out there, but this quite good for how cheap it is."
9O-L6F0cMfNmE5i07pN_xQ,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,3,"Mediocre. Their selection isn't great. They don't seem to have a rotating special.  I've had the lemon merengue (twice), triple chocolate, and the key lime. The key lime was extremely tart. No balance between sweet and sour. The first time I got the lemon merengue, the merengue was tough,like old pudding skin. The second time was better. The lemon and key lime have almost no crust. And the crust on the lemon was soggy. The triple chocolate was like something you could make with the JELL-O brand. The atmosphere wasn't bad and the girl at the counter was nice and seemed knowledgeable enough."

We came here at 1030 on a Monday, the place was 3/4 full and we probably waited at most 10 min to get our food.  It was good. The staff isn't overly friendly, but they aren't as slow as some reviews say. I would recommend this place."
piHJq_NDrOh5SYk3AyQVOg,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,3,"Second time here. This place lost a star because they implemented valet parking. [prepare for small rant] Valet parking for this size of restaurant is the dumbest thing they could have done. I understand the girls who own this place want to pretend this place is nicer than it is, but it's not valet parking nice. There are literally 8 parking spots! The dirty chai is really good  and the oatmeal is one of the best I've had. The bacon is candied, I personally am not a fan of that."
QSCDR9RBTVyTw7p_Nbq1Xg,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,1,"This place is run by a bunch of incompetent retards. I NEVER get what I order, I always have to have them remake it. They are extremely disorganized.

3KTY5XZfavc85u0_rLFHrw,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,3,"I'm glad there are places to get food after 2am! Not exactly the best food in Old Town Scottsdale, but it's a way better choice then the fast food places around that area. Philly cheesesteaks are simple cheese and steak, perfect for soaking up all that alcohol still hanging around. Don't really have much else to say. Oh yeah, there is also an eMac if you need to check your email."

The coffee rub steak tacos were amazing, would recommend to anyone who loves tacos and wants something a little different in a good way."

This is your spot. Lenny doesn't mess around, not one bit. He runs a tight ship here and they crank out hundreds of mouth-watering burgers every day. He knows what the people like, he knows what the people want and so he gives it to em. Don't come here looking for anything artsy or the latest burger fad, come here if you got a couple bucks on you and you want something that will hit the spot.  The homie has milkshakes too, if somehow you got room for one of them."
OoYwJANV9zD-_OA4Atu-gg,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,4,"I don't normally eat Japanese food so I can't compare, but I thought it was pretty good! At first I thought 10 bucks for a bowl of some ramen noodles was crazy but when I saw how big the damn bowl was, I was satisfied. They have a lot of different bowls to choose from as well as toppings to add which definitly gives me a reason to come back."
nXKaLgLuLs2-S8_O-V09-A,TMaBWSv75DEuXyZlGJj6cg,5,"This place is good for being such a small shop. I like the prices, most lunches are an even 6 bucks. I like some of the specialty burgers, they have unique flavors without feeling like they are overloaded with toppings. The location is in kind of a weird spot, I had to squeeze my car into a little alleyway to access the rear parking lot but it's all good once you step into the place. I just wish the whole area was decorated like the burger place, the other attached restaurants look boring and plain when sitting in the world of the magic mushroom."
jf_h_Y8iNaduXJvpgLRPng,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,2,"Not great.  Was hoping to like this place since they appear to have great happy hour deals and a good environment for catching games on TV, but our food came out cold and bland.  At least it's another chain that I can cross off of my ""chains I've never been to"" list."
hAioxEk3WU-SzlqIM4TI7w,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I'm a little surprised by the number of so-so reviews of this place.  I had the Crispy Chicken Flautas appetizer as my meal.  They were filling, but more importantly, they were deliciously spicy; I really could've used a glass of milk to cool off!  I'm looking forward to going back and trying something different."
axi57Y3h5c8BxM1Xyj0KBw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"Grimaldi's is a popular pizza place in NY and I like how they've carried the NY theme throughout the restaurant, even with subway signs in the bathroom.  I've been here bunches of times but apparently never during a rush because I've never had to wait for a table.

Pizza, salad, dessert - that's it.  I've never had enough room for dessert, even though I go in there with every intention of trying the cheesecake.  I just get too full on the salad and pizza.

A ""small"" salad is big enough for at least 2 people.  You could probably stretch it to 4 people if you all want just a taste of salad before your pizza.  The dressing is a little heavy, and while I don't eat salad that way at home, I do enjoy it as a bit of a treat when I go out.

The pizza is wood fired, thin-crust New York style.  It comes out looking more like a piece of modern art than pizza.  There's a bit of sauce here, some cheese there, other toppings over there.  The mozzarella is fresh and I've enjoyed each of the meat toppings at one point or another.  The crust is thin and crispy, but definitely not thick enough to pick up and eat, so I eat this pizza with a fork and knife.

Good food, good atmosphere, and late hours - this location is open until 11 p.m. every night."
fDiyDg1pUetf9dMLFJ6oXw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"This location is a Taco Bell/Long John Silvers combo restaurant.  It stands out because of the guy that we call ""Happy Guy"".  He works the drive-through and is super friendly.  If you go through the drive-through at night time and he is working, you'll know who I'm talking about.  Another pro on this location - they have never messed up my order (crossing my fingers that I didn't just jinx that.)  The only con about this location is the hours; they close surprisingly early for a fast food restaurant with a drive through."
RtnTbhWYw4QjKhoTBV37OA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I think ordinarily I would give this place 3 stars, but this review is based on my experience here on New Year's Eve.  After attending a Coyotes game, we came over to the Yard House for a late dinner.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed but we were able to find a couch to sit on outside during our 1.5 hour wait for a table.  Yeah, that's a long time to wait for this place, but like I said it was NYE and we didn't have any later plans, so we didn't mind hanging out.  Coincidentally, you can get full bar and menu service on the couches outside and we enjoyed some drinks while happily waiting for a proper table and chairs for dinner.

The food was OK; nothing really to write home about.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert - the warm brownie with ice cream was a treat!  When we finished our meal, it was about 11:15 p.m. - definitely too late to go somewhere else to countdown to the new year.  So, we hung out.  Our waitress, Jaime, was very friendly and surprisingly attentive for how busy the restaurant was.  She gave us festive top hats, tiaras, and beads to wear to celebrate.  We were also provided with champagne for a midnight toast.   All of this was free, and there had been no cover charge to get in.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  At ten minutes to the hour, the music turned off and the volume on the TVs, which had all been switched to the big ball drop in NYC, was turned up.  Everybody in the restaurant excitedly awaited the arrival of the new year and when the clock struck 12 there was toasting and cheering.  Yeah, this may all sound very mellow, but it was a fun, relatively cheap (given that every other place had a cover charge and/or price fixe menu), safe place to bring in the new year."
cOZLg1c-UcB2Yj3baQDKkA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,5,"Delicious food at a reasonable value, super friendly and professional wait staff, very clean, and nice atmosphere without being pretentious.  The ""Classic Dinner"" options state that they come with Caesar salad, mixed vegetables, and baked potato, but they are very accommodating and you can easily substitute another salad and/or potato choice.

The wedge salad is great, assuming you enjoy bleu cheese... the bacon-wrapped filet, well, what can I say - when you wrap one kind of meat with another kind of meat, you can't go wrong!  Even the standard baked potato was delish.  For dessert, they have these great shot glass desserts that would give you just a taste of something sweet, but of course I had to go all out and get a full-sized dessert.  The name of the dessert I got was something like ""Billy Miner Pie.""  Mocha ice cream on an oreo pie crust sprinkled with toasted almonds - divine!

Try this place... it's good stuff!"
P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"This place is supposed to be all about the tacos and between the meat choices and tortilla choices I think you could have around 10 different tacos, but they are traditional tacos with just meat, onions, and cilantro inside of 2 small tortillas (corn or flour.)  The problem with this is that I can't eat onions or cilantro... at all... I hate them.  So, I went with tostadas.  I had 1 chicken and 1 carne asada.  I enjoyed both very much!  The tostadas are very simple; layered bottom to top are: tostada shell, beans, meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes.  Both the chicken and carne asada were very flavorful, and while the beans were a bit watery, they tasted really good as well.

The place is tiny and crowded, but the service is very friendly and I think the quality of the food makes up for the downfalls.  This is probably my favorite Triple D place so far."
cy9bWd0tufGp-xkA8CIHIQ,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,2,"I ordered the Sweet Mongolian noodle box, Dan Dan noodle box, and one order of gyoza to go.  I received the Dan Dan noodle box and 2 orders of gyoza, and sadly, did not discover the mistake until I was already home.  If it were not the holiday season, I would've gone back to get my order corrected, but the mall is a mad house at this time of year, so I ended up just having gyoza for dinner that night.

I should've read the description more carefully because it says ""5 crispy chicken gyoza pieces"" and had I noticed the ""crispy"" part, I would not have ordered it because I prefer steamed gyoza.  However, I will say that the citrus soy sauce was tasty.  The Dan Dan noodle box was for my husband.  It is described as ""extra spicy"" which is why he chose it.  He said that while it was spicy, it was just that - spicy for the sake of being spicy, but not adding anything to the overall flavor.

Even with our less than stellar experience, I would like to give the place another shot.  There are several items on their menu that are of interest; I just hope I get what I order next time!"
nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"Yum!  Try it!

Adorable, small restaurant, so make a reservation.  The service was top notch.  Full bar, including a fairly extensive wine list.  I had the Insalata Pera e Gorgonzola (mixed greens with pears, walnuts, gorgonzola, and blue cheese dressing) and the Stuffed Asiago Gnocchi (potato dumplings stuffed with potatoes and asiago cheese.)  Both the salad and entree were delicious!  The gnocchi was particularly interesting as I hadn't had cheese in gnocchi before.  If you haven't had gnocchi before, be forewarned that it is a very rich and filling dish.  I took at least half of it home with me.  It heated up well for lunch the next day.  My friends ordered the Calamari Fritti appetizer and I have to say that it didn't look too special.  Everything else looked great though, and there were certainly no complaints at our table.  There is a small selection of desserts on the menu, but we were all so full that we couldn't partake.  I definitely need to come back to try other menu items including the Prosciutto e Melon.  Can't wait!"
gRMYm-CeEdjXtaQcVo8vsw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,5,"Really delicious food, and I can't wait to go back!  I'm surprised to see negative reviews on the service; our waitress couldn't have been nicer.  The only downside is the small parking lot.  It was completely full when we arrived, yet the restaurant was probably 3/4 empty.  Not a huge deal because the strip mall's surrounding parking lots offer plenty of spaces; you just have to walk a bit.

The nigiri was soft and buttery.  The rolls were good, but were not rolled tightly enough, so they fell apart when trying to eat them and I lost a lot of rice in my dish of soy sauce.

The gyoza was steamed and probably the best I've had in Gilbert.  (Interestingly though, the gyoza that came with the kids meal was fried and not nearly as good.)  The edamame was served salty and piping hot - just like I like it!

At $8, the kids meals are probably the priciest kids meals I've ever seen, but they included salad, miso soup, your choice of entree, and ice cream, so they're still a pretty good value."
9jdlzH0HjU9_Fi3D-_a6gA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,2,"The great thing about going out for Mexican food is that even if the meal is not good, you can leave full if you stuff yourself with chips and salsa.  I can only describe the food as flavorless.  The fried tortilla of my chimichanga tasted like an egg roll; how weird is that!?  On the plus side, the waitress was friendly and attentive... unfortunately, going out to eat isn't just about service, so I won't likely be coming back."
Fv3HvJPQYqfmniTgtIQJzA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"The atmosphere is what really sells this place.  There's something about it that just feels kind of homey and inviting.  The outdoor patio is a great place to relax with some coffee and friends.  The indoor area is nice, too, because of the large windows that let in a lot of light.  However, if the place is full, especially if there are kids, it can get kind of loud.

I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed various iced coffee drinks.  The last time I went, I ordered food as well.  I had the Papas Grande which is scrambled eggs, cheese, potatoes, and bacon served inside a thin flour tortilla.  It also came with salsa which I asked for on the side, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not chunky and had just enough spice to make the meal interesting.

Not giving 5 stars just because of food service timing.  We waited quite a long time for our food and when the food finally came out, two of us were served while our third person had to wait even longer for his food - so long in fact, that the two of us that had food were almost halfway finished by the time the third dish was served.

Other than that hiccup, we enjoyed the food and the coffee.  Will be back again."
PEnlf5CJ8JJonph2jIljCg,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"I'd probably give this place 3.5 stars, so for the sake of yelp, I'll round up.  They have a nice big menu with tons to choose from for any meal of the day.  While I've enjoyed the food and have had friendly service, I'm just not excited about the place.  The pastry display at the front of the store is beautiful and definitely piques your interest, but I'd say it's 1/3-1/2 full of butter cookies and while butter cookies are good, how excited can you get about them?  The prices are a little high, but then kids eat free on Tuesday."
GqjC12LAufljzZmMcPSPJw,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,5,"Yum-a-dum-dum!  The Gilbert House is really adorable and I was excited to eat in this classic, old world charm house-turned-restaurant.  We came at a non-peak time - about 11 a.m. on a Thursday morning - so while there were customers there, we did not have to wait for a table.

I ordered the Hearty Scramble and shared with my mom who ordered a pancake and a side of hash browns.  My dad ate the toast that came with the scramble, but the rest was just about the right amount for my mom and me to share.

The Hearty Scramble is made with eggs, bacon, ham, sausage and cheese.  There was just the right mixture of ingredients such that no one flavor overtook the meal.  The hash browns were perfectly browned.  And the deliciously fluffy pancake and syrup added just enough sweetness to round out the flavors in the meal.

Looking forward to going back again!"
oCwJdiYhZS8VM5_LgmQP0g,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,2,"The meal starts with some really good chips served with a selection of 3 different salsas and a bean dip.  But, that's as impressive as it gets.  The main plates are more about quantity over quality and I felt like the prices were high compared to similar restaurants.  The service was fine, but I just wasn't taken with the food and probably won't be back."
fckUjXz1GKpafT4x7-MVJA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"They took the Chicken con Broccoli off of the menu!  So bummed!  Luckily the all-you-can-eat soup, salad and breadsticks are still an option at lunch time."
P4lcAvH_JqOIUPyNE5LoJA,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,3,"Even though this place is very tiny, I really like the feel of it.  It kind of reminds me of some of the restaurants in San Francisco and since that was home for me once upon a time, this place evokes feelings of nostalgia.

I had the summer salad and a side of fries.  Both dishes had huge portions of food.  The description of the salad was better than the actual flavors.  That's not to say it was bad; it just sounded better when I was checking it out on the menu.  The fries were big steak fries served piping hot with just the right amount of salt.  I'd go back just for the fries.

They have a lot on their menu, so I definitely want to go back to give some other dishes a try."
sbnKkn2Es06ERhPLtlNY_A,460PoNGmuFFKF4cJ2XQj9A,4,"Take advantage of online ordering (or phone app ordering) to order ahead and then walk in, skip the line, and pick up your food! It's great! The online and app ordering process is very easy, and lets you highly customize your order. Once you place your order, you're given a time when your order will be ready, and that time has never been more than 15 minutes from when I hit ""send.""  My only problem is that there are a few items missing: you can't order a kid's meal or a simple side of rice or beans. Other than that, it's a very efficient way to place an order.

At this location, there are a couple of nearby ""restaurant only - 15 minutes"" parking spots.  Order ahead, use one of these parking spots, and you're in and out in no more than 5 minutes."

bxRFIGAcYREvDBT3Nw3Vaw,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,5,"Great food, yummy appetizers, and tacos!  The Brisket sandwich is a top seller and we agree!  Steak tacos are a must and if you want a lighter meal, go for the salads!  Service is always consistently good, staff is friendly and attentive. There are many sports bars in Scottsdale to choose from, put this one on the top of your list!"

All of the baked muffins, cookies are really fantastic here but the triple chocolate chip cookies are amazing!  Delicious healthy salads and sandwiches, Chloes Corner never disappoints!  Friendly service, clean restaurant and bathroom.  Haven't been for breakfast/brunch yet but the lunch menu is solid and this place is always very popular and busy!"
l4SRHKV2XLdUR_QpvVxI1g,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,5,"Love this place!  Friendly staff, Emily is our fav!  Awesome live music with Marley Taylor, we go and dance every weekend!!!  She packs the place.  Great food, Cuban sandwich is the best in town and the salmon is fantastic.  This is the local hang folks, good people, yummy food and a fun time for me and my friends-every time!"
JIETwXSEGIHMNyxZVEnNKQ,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,2,"A bit overpriced, both chicken and tri tip bowl were good but very dry....  This place also does not have a friendly vibe....  It's pretty pretentious.  Good intention with healthy food but smug is in the air..."

Restaurant was busy for lunch  but unkept, there were picture frames and extra stuff blocking tables and on tables, so we could barely squeeze into our table from boxes etc..."
1a9YViZDThy3VqBnGOatmQ,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,1,"Not great like it used to be!  First, bathroom was out of toilette paper and hand soap.  Sunday for dinner 6pm, they are out of meatballs and chocolate syrup for chocolate milk for the kids and for desserts...  Had to wait about 15 minutes for a refill on bread, service was meh...  Overpriced and corporate."

_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,2,"Nice Gimmick, but really over complicating food, mixing too many different styles....small servings, more like tapas style.  You are better off going to the best Mexican restaurant in town or the best sushi bar in town and forget trying to combine and blend the two!  Trendy, maybe too trendy for this area....  I wonder if this place will be open in a year or two?"
7pGWy3mR7gjMSE6x2njqPA,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,4,"Wonderful spot for breakfast or lunch with delicious food, bananas foster french toast, wildberry pancakes...  Fresh, real ingredients and friendly service!  We've tried most breakfast/lunch spots in Scottsdale and this one tops them all!"

She performed there for years, has a huge following & is a locals favorite in this town and now-we no longer see her there & the live music has been TERRIBLE lately, it's just not the same...  so we are all not coming back.  Unless you bring Marley Taylor back!!!!"
BgAV4IwXkd8gpuyUJX2wnQ,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,5,"Authentic Italian restaurant run by a beautiful sweet family!  Try the eggplant Parmesan-top menu choice!  Veal Marsala, another great choice, tender and fantastic!"
IkLAUX7lZIWqE9_YC66SRw,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,1,"IL Crapo!  This was disgusting, cold over cooked veal, pizza was burnt, salad missing DRESSING and other ingredients.  Terrible!!!!  We left hungry and out $60 as the table next to us felt the same about their IL Crapo food.  We told the manager and he smiled and said sorry.  Don't waste your time or money, Guidos is right around the corner and Oreganos across the street."

I can't even pick a fav out of the smoothies-they are all great!   And the new Skoop cashew milk ice cream is a must!  Chocolate Skoop, strawberry skoop-yes to everything on the menu.  Locations are super clean, friendly employees, great rewards program-Nekter is the best in town for juices, smoothies, acai bowls & healthy snacks."

However, this location in particular is possibly having issues with their water.  We ordered waters to drink, they tasted like metal, then the sauce on the pizza was very bitter.  We just dined at downtown Scottsdale Grimaldis last week and everything tasted so much better there!  So could be possible issues with their water and you can taste it in the  pizza..."

Good friendly service, restaurant is very clean.  Only complaint is the cookies and muffins, brownies etc... look great but they do not keep them covered!  So flies were all over them...  Hopefully mgmt will cover these so they remain fresh and protected from germs and insects!!!!  Last two times we went, sandwiches were burnt! Not so good. Also the chopped salad is really too sugary, with apricots and apricot dressing, apples etc....  Wish they'd make it more like the chopped salad at chloes"
C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,5,"First of all, the staff is the friendliest-love the good energy they all have!!!!  Fish tacos are my favorite, delicious, fresh ingredients, consistently great!!!

Don't walk, run to this fantastic cozy little neighborhood fish cafe!"
b_8jCti0vuouJ_fjZpdmZw,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,5,Fantastic food and such a cozy place to dine casually and listen to live music too!  Everything we have tried from pizza to pot roast to green chile stuffed rigatoni is amazing!  What a gem here in Scottsdale! We go on Thursdays and love love love listening to live music by Marley Taylor!  Soul Cafe is my favorite restaurant!
YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,1,"Amanda, our server, was the best part of this horrible meal!  Overrated, overpriced, over complicated food!  My salad was anything but colorful, the lettuce was yellow!!!  You are better off going to filibertos.  Sol is another North Scottsdale fancy version of food that should be kept fresh and simple."
tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,1,"Unbelievably BAD service!!! Our waiter was terrible!  He forgot everything, took forever, no drink refills, no accurate order placement-he basically forgot about us (and his is Saturday at 4pm, not rush hour) no efficiency, the worst I have seen in a long time!  Food quality here is ok but I ordered the ahi tuna salad, lettuce looked old and gross.  Really everything on the menu is loaded with sugar and salt.  But the service was ridiculous, never going back!!!!!"
yX0pOWG_Be9TjGnm0aihVA,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,2,"Wanted to try something new for lunch, cool concept but food just doesn't cut it!  First of all, not organic, sandwiches very dry.  If you want a sandwich just go next door to Firehouse!  If you want a great burger go to Smashburger and if you want great pizza- Grimaldis.  Don't waste your money here. Staff is not trained on food or menu, please train the staff!  And pictures would be helpful for a new restaurant that no one has heard of...  2 stars for atmosphere and cleanliness"
G8k2E3oYHHl2o4lNJQwR-g,yZ5QlPkN4ZEx3rPOWYFx2g,5,"Fantastic, quality, homemade dishes!  Family owned and always consistently great food!

It has jalapeños in them and it's delicious healthy portion. We also had the spicy pickles and they were delicious! The sauce they come with is a very good pairing. We also had the peach moonshine and mojito moonshine and they were also very good. I will be back for sure.

Her authentic,vibrant, home made recipes is what has always set her food apart from the rest! Some of my favorites include the shrimp cocktail, chile Colorado and the chirps are slap your momma good! The environment is vibrant and the staff is always friendly!"
CZKHXlDuy3IagC2W881fyA,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,5,Wow.....truly impressed with the craftsmen ship of each cocktail. Each drink was perfectly balanced and tasteful. The ambiance was comfortable and modern. The staff was warm and inviting and truly mastered their craft. It is our new go to spot for visitors and date night.
i4lr0CSppvtjZAqqlEKekw,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,5,I need to buy some chocolates for my wife for our anniversary and just some random ones from any store would do so I found this store on Yelp. They have a large selection of chocolates and they were all delicious. My wife loves them. We will go back in the future to try them all!
Lsy_RA1xk9qHFLzLNWKBww,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,5,"We found this great piece of heaven on yelp while trying to find good local food. This place lived up to the hype!  The spicy hummus was the best I ever had. I also had the pork ribs and my wife had the grilled shrimp, both plates were awesome. They serve hefty portions which I like because you get your money's worth and more. The staff was very nice and personable and answered any questions we had for our first visit."

I779CNMLWhZu6BxkGfLvwQ,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,4,"Staff was very friendly and inviting! The restaurant itself had very nice decor and comfortable chairs with bright open patios that matched perfectly with the weather. The drinks we ordered (margarita and Mojito)could have been better for my liking, they lacked alcohol and flavor. The food though was exceptional! We ordered ceviche, bison cedar plank burger, and diablo roll and they were all perfectly cooked! They had vibrant full bodied flavor which I highly recommend all of them!  All this paired with attentive staff made for a great first impression. We will be back."
-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,4,"Really cool place! Very hip and young vibe and environment. The decor was eccentric but modern. The menu was creative Mexican food with a modern twist. The nachos were really good, they used a really good white cheese. The tacos are also pretty good, the shrimp especially are tasty. Friendly helpful staff. The have creative alcoholic drinks and you can add alcohol to their agua frescas.We will for sure  go back."
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,4,"Jay Z and Beyoncé, milk and cookies, Chino Bandido, Nutella and virtually anything.... What do all these have in common? Two worlds coming together to create a dynamic duo! Chinese food meets Mexican food! The greatest love story that has never been told! We enjoyed everything we ate, Jerk chicken, red jade chicken, jerk rice, black beans, pork and jerk chicken quesadilla! Don't let the jerk word fool you it has great robust flavor with even better price! I recommend this place on your next outing fo sho."
hHtOsr-NMviBKlMqDBeI9Q,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,5,"I recently moved to AZ and wanted to try a local spot. I got on yelp and found this place and it was a pleasant surprise. Great breakfast and lunch that you can tell everything is homemade. The pancakes are awesome, the homemade jelly is equally fantastic. I also recommend the build a burger option for lunch, they have great options like chorizo. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I had the chance to meet yoli herself and she was extremely nice and outgoing! She even sat down and talked to us and shared her story. Me and my family are now regulars, even when my parents come in from out of town this is the first place they want to go."
36GvUjLg3drdOB3jgpqTOQ,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,1,"So this review is based off our bar experience ONLY:

So we ordered custom drinks both were poorly made. They were watered down and lacked taste and substance. They barely put any alcohol in them. We also asked for guacamole chips and salsa which were never brought to us even though he came out with a tray full chips salsa etc for the rest of the people at the bar but us. The bar staff needs to be retrained in customer service and attention to detail. They should be at their top of their game on peak nights and they were not. We will not be back........to the bar at least."
umBsUDjSPzF28LOw-U_NfA,I4BS0R9_OjJKOPjGCO4eSw,4,"I had the arrachera and wife had shrimp tacos and they were pretty good! We also had the Carne asada quesadilla and it also very good. The salsas were very tasty, not very spicy though. The margaritas were well made and had a good balance if taste and alcohol. Very nice and clean restaurant with very friendly staff. We will be back for sure."

IUacTdoWEWEODMVFlUOOlw,jEjMfYBBFnhcuT1WU4Y-2A,3,I've only had one bad experience here among the multiple times I've patronized this establishment. The bad experience turned worse after I submitted an online complaint and the manager left a sarcastic voicemail in response to my online complaint. Boooo! If my order and service wasn't so bad during that visit I wouldn't have had a reason to complain!
r0rtl4OsZy-F099jeO_DKA,jEjMfYBBFnhcuT1WU4Y-2A,5,"Love, love, love this place. My lunch break is at 8am in the morning and they always let me make a greek salad early in the morning. Food is always fresh and service is awesome!"

Q6F59ID2Js8Sop2vRcVz-w,jEjMfYBBFnhcuT1WU4Y-2A,5,Great salad buffet! The blueberry muffins are always good and hot! Too expensive for just salad though. Awesome service! Warm cookies are a nice touch.
sKHDoLqDj99UuAP8ljSaTw,jEjMfYBBFnhcuT1WU4Y-2A,1,"Food was okay but staff was unfriendly. Order a kids meal and was charged for a regular meal. When I mentioned that I order a kids meal the cashier looked at me and asked ""Are you sure?"" Horrible experience."

My sister had wild berry bliss toast. Also ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of cheese grits. Ordered so much to sample due to the amazing delicious looking images provided by Yelpers. We spent about 65 bucks including tip. Well worth it."

Took too long to take drink order, took to long to take food order, food took forever to arrive and it wasn't even hot! Garlic bread was cold! Kid never got refill, another person in my party water was taken to refill but never brought back. Took forever to receive check. I'm a regular at this Applebee's but I will not be going back."

The kids pizza took 1 hour, the food was cold my order was wrong twice and the manager had the nerve to think I was going to pay for food I didn't get to eat. This experience was when they first opened. Glad I went back because I had twins for waiters and they were awesome! Totally changed my view of Spinatos. The chicken Marsala is great, bread sticks are the best and the atmosphere is hip and trendy."

I came here with my daugther, sister, and some co-workers. I had surgery that restricted me to a certain type of drink. The waiter said I had to throw my drink away do to health code. I was fine with that so I put my bottle in my purse. I asked for water so I could add my protein powder in the water provided.  I was mid way finished with my drink and instead of her asking could she refill she reached across the table and refilled my protein powdered water with lemon water. WTF? Also the booth we were in smelled funky, like dish water... eeek! I will still come for the Tootsy Makie and Tempura Shrimp but I will make sure I always sit outside."

Unfortunately the acoustics of the room we were seated in were not so good.  In other words it was loud and difficult to hear my wife's conversation.  Perhaps something can be done to absorb the noise (for instance some well placed cloth wall hanging might help).  Overall, we had a good experience and would go again."
Yol50D2sHVAmbBMAKeLMAQ,WBDenhIG-zB271HN9CVAAQ,3,"I've always had mixed feelings about the Paisley Violin--I really want to like it more.  There is a lot to like here:  decent beer selection, local art hosted all around, outside eating areas.

I went last week for a friend's birthday shindig.  I had the chicken schwarma, which was ok.  And perhaps that is what is missing for me at Paisley, the food was just ""meh"" and the service was not outstanding either.

It's on my list for trying out more often and perhaps I will be more impressed."

We ordered a large with italian sausage, mushrooms, and black olives.  Spinato's did not disappoint--the pizza was not greasy, just really good.  It's a little bit out of the way in an industrial park of Tempe, but don't let that scare you away.  I'm looking forward to eating some more of Spinato's creations."

The ambiance is good, a bit arty but not trying too hard--it's a good place for relaxing and feeling a little chilled out.  I tried some Riesling and my girlfriend tried the Pomegranate Margarita.  They were both really good drinks and brought up our mood from the prior disappointments.  Service was good.  I would go to FEZ again and try the food and additional cocktails."

Do you like pizza?  Then this is your place!  It's yummy yummy.

Possibly the biggest drawback to Papago is that it is loud here--listening to your dining companions can be quite a challenge.  But you'll probably be drinking so much brew it won't matter much."

However, after a fiasco at trying to get a downstairs seat at Rokerij and then traversing a couple of other places, the only place that delivered was Houston's.  I will say, this is the only bar/restaurant that has merited a 30% tip from me.  Though they were out of the first bottle of wine we selected, they offered a better wine for the same price.  Sweet.  EXCELLENT service and very good food and wine.  That, on top of a really nice low-key ambiance accented by dim lighting, was what earned my rare five-star review of Houston's."

The bartenders were attentive & what's more .... they have CHIMAY on tap!  I haven't tried the food yet, so can't comment on that.  Bonus points for being close to where I live.  I think I will be making return trips to this neat little hideaway."

Remember that time the girl behind the counter was puzzling over my request for some Gomasho?  Oh I meant the 500 times (it's ok, eventually she figures out what I'm asking for).  Remember that time Kirk and I saw a cockroach hanging out near the bathrooms?  It really happened!  But only one time did I see it.  Don't get defensive now, Yoshi's, but please take care of that problem if you haven't already.  It's ok, we will still do business together---especially if you keep your prices moderate.  I'll still order Dragon chicken.  I'll still brave your parking lot, fending off the odd transient here and there.  It's nice to know you'll always be there for some decent japanese style food at a moderate price."

We shared a bottle of Riesling.  It was very busy on the Saturday night we went, so instead of sitting out the one hour wait we decided on eating at the bar.  The fish was terrific and fresh--I understand it's shipped in same day from Los Angeles.  I felt the ""chips"" part of the Fish and Chips were kinda lame given the price of the meal.  Also, occasionally a really nasty odor wafted in--I think maybe a sewer smell from outdoors coming in through the open windows.  That only happened a couple of times & I wouldn't expect that to be the general experience for people eating here.  Altogether a good eating experience."

As the previous reviewers mentioned, it is a cozy quaint restaurant adorned with Diego Rivera prints.  I had a pork dish (sorry don't remember its proper name) with cream corn and mashed potatoes ($19), fantastic to the taste.  And I imbimbed a terrific Mai Tai ($9).  The service too was terrific.  I'm told the Bistro is busier on weekends, so you may wish set a reservation or dine on a week night."

I like the Natural and the Classic.  It's got a cozy atmosphere and a friendly staff.  Outside seating is a plus ... oh and they serve one of my favorite beers--Peroni.  Excellent for people that like low-key dining.

So many amazing family memories were created here so it's tough for me to go anywhere else and be quite as happy. The owners know my family and are always ready with a hug. This is truly a real-deal Phoenix institution. I have so many favorite items but here are few must-tries: chicken lettuce wraps (I'd been eating these here looooong before so-called ""fusion"" joints like PF Chang's had them on their menu), sizzling rice chicken, sesame chicken, Desert Jade chow mein, honey-dipped chicken wings, any one of their delicious soups. So much to choose from and it's all done exceedingly well with true consistency. Support a local, family-run joint for truly fabulous Chinese food!"
xQtCOQIwrGIiDeHWVHdkBw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"I came here for lunch with a friend on a quiet weekday. While the service was fine, the food was lacking for me. Thankfully, their menu catered to my current dietary needs but my eggplant parmesan (ingeniously breaded with quinoa and very kindly modified to be made without dairy) was lacking in the flavor department. My eggplant slices were dry-tasting with dry dollops of tomato sauce in dry-breaded quinoa....on a bed of watery spaghetti squash. The food was just OK. Not bad, but certainly not worth the high price tag. Between my guest's salad and soup and my entree, our bill was about $30 with gratuity. The food deserves a solid two-star rating but I'm giving an extra star for the fact that a place like this even exists and can cater to the nutritional needs of folks who can't do gluten, dairy, egg, animal products, etc."
9kjk05G50XWnmJQBz_wcnw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"My best friend and I are real ramen jockeys. We have ramen'd from the hillcrests of San Diego to the Valleys of Chino. We. Know. Legit. Ramen.

We were excited to take advantage of the ""Rainy Day Special"" which takes $8 off your bill when you buy at least 2 bowls of ramen. The idea here is that you're getting a ""free"" bowl of ramen but $8 is the cost of the basic bowl of ramen - you need to pay extra for additional items, many of which are standard in a bowl of solid ramen (i.e., egg and pork). Ok, this is fine. There are several fine ramen joints across our great land that allow you to customize your ramen, such as the splendiferous Shin-Sen-Gumi Ramen of Los Angeles.

We both got the Paitan broth (most similar to tonkotsu ramen for those in the know). By the time we got to the restaurant at 6:30, they had already run out of chashu pork and a couple other proteins. We ended up going with the roasted pork for our proteins and customized our bowls from there. We placed our orders with a very sweet server and waited....and waited...and waited.

Our bowls finally arrived and the sweet server kindly explained that the kitchen had run out of roasted pork and subbed shredded chicken instead......record scratch....what? They just subbed in a protein without telling us? To paraphrase Rick James, you can't just sub chicken for pork in a bowl of ramen like it's the thing to do. Neither of us have EVER been to a restaurant where an item is subbed for the ordered item without notifying the guest in advance. It was very Ramen Twilight Zone.

We flagged down our server and explained that we didn't want shredded chicken ramen and requested a bowl without protein instead. Our server was gracious and we waited....some more. She brought a bowl of ""on the house"" edamame for our hassle which was very kind. We noshed on our edamame and our bowls came out much quicker this time but with much less broth and noodles than before. It was clear that the kitchen was now rationing out smaller portions. Fortunately, the server hadn't taken the chicken ramen so we grabbed our noodles and extra broth to zhush up the newly delivered bowls.

Taste: LEGIT. The broth and noodles were among the best we've ever tasted here in Phoenix, Itwould have been nice to sample the pork to get a truly authentic experience, but the essence of the soup was damn good.

Oh, and when we got our check, it looked like we were charged for those ""on the house"" edamame.

If they can get their act together, we will be back."
e9UsRb-fmza5ukU8Ftduew,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,Ok so $20 bucks will get you access to a very large selection of very mediocre food. I was under the impression that the sushi selection would be bigger but the handful of rolls they had were average. We went early to beat the dinner rush and it looked like an awful lot had been sitting since the lunch shift. I'm not big on buffets to begin with but I've certainly had better.
acD0l-j5Kr-edoO-_tcbyg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"Oh, Baby Kay's. It's been a long time since I've dined here. The etoufee has always been a personal favorite (crawfish, especially but the shrimp is also great) and that wonderful, slightly spicy thick blonde roux is where it's at! The service was very good.  My quibble is that the food is rather expensive ($19 for the crawfish etoufee?!?) Overall, good food with good service but unnecessarily pricey."
vC23Fq8lMkNiZ4F8yh3ukQ,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"This is a tough review to write because I had really high expectations for this place. One huge positive here is that they do a Saturday reverse happy hour after 9pm so I brought a group of 6 in for drinks and snacks. The service itself was pretty good and our server was SUPER-SWEET AND COOL and but the food was disappointing. I ordered the volcano roll which had a mushy texture and a rather unpleasant flavor overall. I tasted the spicy tuna and did not care for it. My plum wine was nice and I enjoyed the fried chicken wings on the happy hour menu, but it was INCREDIBLY loud. They had a DJ spinning which was a nice touch but it was so damn loud (uncomfortably so) that I could barely hear my dining companions or the server.

I MIGHT be apt to try it again because it is a really lovely little joint and the happy hour prices are fantastic.  In the meantime, however, 2 stars."
M8Co6Z9U7bPke7Xq9fFRBg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,"Long ago, there was a little girl who'd go out with her family to a long gone restaurant called Pink Pepper Thai Cuisine.  She'd eagerly await her thai iced tea (her favorite uncle used to call her the Nestle Quik Bunny because she would sip down her thai iced tea with wild abandon just like the Quik Bunny would sip down his chocolate milk) and it would be gone before the meal hit the table.  She'd then tuck into her favorite Pink Pepper dishes (mee krob, pad thai, cream chicken, satay etc) and it was heavenly.

The little girl grew up and moved away from Phoenix for many years.  Upon her recent return, she noticed that Pink Pepper had gone out of business and Tara Thai had taken it's place.  She whipped out her smartphone and checked Yelp to get the scoop on Tara Thai.  Turns out that the employees and yummy recipes were still there even though the name had changed.

She decided to hop on in to try the lunch buffet.  It was early in the lunch hour and everything was fresh out on the buffet.  After some pleasurable nomming on cream chicken, mee krob, vegetable spring rolls and other assorted delights from her childhood, one of the servers recognized her as the little girl who used to come in with her family all of the time.  Her heart swelled. She remembered happy times as a child and remembered her uncle calling her the Quik Bunny as she drank her thai iced tea.

She thanked the server.  Gave a little wink to the restaurant gods for the happy memories and knew she'd be back again soon for unrivaled Thai food....and she dined happily ever after."
2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"I found the food to be average-to-good, I had the kibbeh plate (rather tasty and plentiful portions) and my dining companion enjoyed a sandwich. The food is inexpensive and service is relatively quick. Our server was very pleasant. When I went up to the cashier to settle the tab, I noticed they had an impressive variety of baklava and turkish delight candy in the case. I LOVE turkish delight - it's my favorite candy of all time. Naturally, I requested a few pieces to go. I got home minutes later to find that the turkish delight was completely stale and dried out. I was so disappointed! However, if you're looking for cheap eats, check this place."
m1Y47fK3vWCJXV3TdCn_Xw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"Dined here for the first time tonight. The food was..A-OK! Certainly not authentic Mediterranean food but I don't think it is trying to be. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the loudness.  Way. Too. Damn. Loud. From an acoustician's standpoint, all the hard surfaces and the cavernous dining room make for a very loud joint. This is a big minus in my book.

On to the food!  We ordered the beef gyro sandwich.  Very average but tasty nonetheless. Checked out the lentils and rice salad served warm over a bed of lettuce and veggies with dressing. Sadly, this was a bit of a miss for me. The rice was quite mushy and just didn't stand up to the heft of the lentils. The taste itself was quite fine but I couldn't get past the texture. Also, if you order this dish, know that the grain/legume level far outweighs the veggies. A huge portion (which is great for the pocketbook) but beware if you're watching carbs. The salad below was actually refreshing but all in all, the dish just wasn't for me.

Also had the dolmades which were quite nice served cold (albeit a little overstuffed for my liking).  Our server was very good, very accommodating with special requests.  Service was a bright spot for sure.

Without a doubt, while I didn't LOVE the food here, it was tasty enough for me to come back again and give it another try!"

Does the decor need updating? Yes, it does but I prefer to think of it as frozen in a simpler time so I do not think they need a renovation. But of course, I am partial to it. With that being said, I have always thought their prices were on the high side. Not prohibitively high, mind you , but higher than I feel good about paying for the portions.

All told this place is still a gem from my childhood and I plan to return over and over again!"

One hallmark of Fez is that the service is quite solid and welcoming so I love that. The Happy Hour prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is trendy but not too stuffy. A-OK!"
9Cq_NVvWZOEAzmE7tqJgmg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,Totally impressive! The owners are so amazing and sweet (they even remembered my name as a repeat customer!)

Support a great local business!
Vw9u6qar1I2QlkQOV6KNVA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,5,"Phenomenal and without question, the best Thai in the Valley. I came here on a Friday night with a friend around 630 and we were seated right away. We shared the appetizer platter (special recognition for the Thai Toast), papaya salad, pad see ew, and green curry with chicken. Don't forget the thai iced tea and mango with sticky rice for dessert! It was a feast and every dish was equally delicious. Our service was very good and for the amount of food we had, I would say the pricing is reasonable.

I love in CenPho but would haul my cookies all the way up here for Thai this good! Highly recommended!"
I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,5,"Dear Nice Folks at Snoh,

If you look into the till, you'll see that you have a lot of my cash. Not that you'd be able to tell it apart from the cash from your other loyal customers, but it's there nonetheless. Personally, I blame you all for putting in such a nice, comfy, artsy hangout spot with delicious Taiwanese-style ice. I blame you for making such delicious thai tea flavored Snoh that now I have a full-on addiction. I don't know if there's SA (Snoh Anonymous) but I'm sure if such a thing existed, I'd be on the roster.

I'm a longtime customer of Cherry Blossom/Tokyo Express and had been wondering about this new joint setting up shop next door. At the recommendation of my friends (one of whom is in the frozen yogurt biz), I came in to try Snoh and now I feel like Frosty the little freakin' Snoh-Elf. My favorite is the thai tea Snoh with boba and condensed milk (or black sesame glaze). My favorite thing is that when the the milk tea Snoh melts, BOOM! You got milk tea! It's a two-fer!

Anyhoozle, thanks to the nice folks at Snoh for opening their doors just as the weather is heating up. Prep the till, gentlemen, more of my cash is going to be making its home there this Summer!"
8jHLEXfoy3Q9TdvJYvtWvg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,"3.5 stars. Look, I love a good gimmick and the founder of Benihana certainly stumbled upon a good one when he decided to make dinner a show decades ago. I've been going through a bizarre period of craving Benihana all the damn time recently and I get my fix at this location. The wait staff's service is very spotty (sometimes attentive, sometimes rushed, sometimes poor) but the teppanyaki chefs are consistently quite good. The food itself is also consistently good.

I've had a couple of incidents at this location with the way they've handled the bill but the manager is fabulously attentive and has always made it right, assuring that I will be back for more.

A lot of these reviews are pretty cynical about this joint and I'm not really sure why. No, I wouldn't come here specifically for sushi. Yes, this seems to be quite a destination for birthdays and you will hear that birthday jingle many times throughout the night. Yes, this is best suited to a special occasion given the cost but I always leave with leftovers for the next day. Yes, they cook with a lot of sodium and butter so if you're watching your figure, take heed. It's a noisy joint with a lot happening everywhere so if you're looking for a quiet place to take your sweetie, this may not be the restaurant for you.

The Chef's Table is a very good perk - they provide you with a $30 gift certificate for your birthday, hence all that singing. Kids (and kids at heart) generally get a kick out of the show - I know I do, even if it is a little silly. And quite frankly, we could ALL use a little silly in our lives."
fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"This is really more of a 3.75 star rating for CherryBlossom. It's interesting country French motif and variety of Asian and Italian specialities are brought to you by the fine folks who brought the Tokyo Express chain to the Valley. The Hakata ramen is pretty darn legit (tasty broth, decent chashu-style pork, and darn good noodles). I had the lunch ramen combo with my old fave, the inari-zushi. The bloom was off the rose, as it were, with the inari-zushi. It was not quite as sweet as it should be (maybe it's an off shipment from their supplier). Overall, the lunch special was good. Their happy hour is a very good value and I plan to return."
Gq3OgSd5KflKuwNJmuWt7Q,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,1,"As my dining companion said, ""never trust a place that charges for chips and salsa!"" Like most other folks who've reviewed this joint, we wound up here because of a Coyotes game. It should have been warning enough that there wasn't a wait to eat here but there was at every other establishment at Westgate. They were serving their much-maligned Event Menu which is truly food court food at resort prices. $5 for chips and salsa? Ridiculous! Between the three of us, there was a taco salad (which I was informed is less tasty than a taco salad served at particular hospital cafeteria in town), a sad veggie burrito and my sad steak burrito, replete with dry steak and missing guac and sour cream until I pointed out to the server.  It took a very long time to get our food, even though the restaurant appeared pretty dead. The server was friendly enough but not very skilled. For three entrees and NO beverages, our tab was nearly $50 before tip. Outrageous prices for subpar food. I agree with other reviewers: Taco Bell food at triple or quadruple the price. No thank you."
BA2tYMpTHR3i7X-6qtcWaw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"One of the challenges of rating a place like this (as other folks have pointed out) is that there is a pretty diverse range of exposure to this cuisine by the others who have already reviewed it.

Perhaps it was an off day but man was I disappointed. Full disclosure: I am a pho snob. There's one particular favorite spot in San Diego and no matter where I've roamed outside of Vietnam, no place comes close. With that being said, the pho here was just full of sad.  The broth lacked the full-bodied herbaciousness I really appreciate about good pho.  Now, to be fair, this is not marketed as a restaurant specializing in the pho experience but rather has a variety of vietnamese foods (banh mi, pho, bun).

I had the Tea Lite Special...it was not special. Flat flavor profile on the broth. Bland meat. The spring roll was not a win. BUT when the pho came out sans fixins' plate (basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos) and they charged me an extra dollar for it after I went back in and asked for it...that just put me over.

The gentleman at the counter (maybe the owner???) was also pretty surly. All told, I likely won't be back."
kUTusjnUPVZUgUJc2GuWuA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,5,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants - and I don't like chain restaurants.  This is a fun place for a date - it has the potential to be quite romantic (just be sure that the person you're bringing along is worth the time, effort, and money).  All cynicism aside, cooking your own morsels of food, though time consuming, is a great way to get to know your date.  They have an extensive wine list.  You'll be spending a lot of time with your server as they prepare cheeses and desserts tableside, so be chatty and be polite.  Try the Coq au Vin cooking style which gives you a nice pot of Burgundy wine and spices in which to cook your food.  This place is a great destination.  Be prepared for a big night on the town!"
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"This was a tough review to write because I've been here twice. Once at the recommendation of a friend and we had great service and great food. Last night was my second visit and my hope is that it was an off night because we had pretty lousy service and the food was not up to the par set at my previous visit.

We walked in and were told to take a table anywhere. We picked a spot that had been covered in crumbs and there was dried food on one of the menus sitting there. Several minutes passed and we were finally able to flag someone down to wipe down the table. At least another 10 minutes pass before I am able to flag a server to place a drink and food order - I asked if we could get our server and the woman told me it was her we were looking for. We asked to start with some oven fries and were informed ""it will take a long as the pasties to make.' Ok, this is fine. My brother had a chicken pot pie pasty and I had the chicken tikka masala pasty which I remembered as being so great from my last visit. And then...the wait.....was looong. Much longer than anticipated. I hope this was just an off night...in the meantime, it will be a while before I'd consider returning."
p81LV6y6Jxz_q_3HL06jOw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,"I've been quite happy with Ra recently. When they first opened in Phoenix several years ago, the sushi and the service were, in my humble opinion, rather mediocre. Over the years, however, the food has gotten more innovative and become very good. I am a HUGE fan of the Hot Mess (crab sauce baked with jalapenos and sweet eel sauce atop crispy rice patties) and my mom loves their grilled salmon. Their sushi happy hour has quite a bit of variety and the value is pretty good for Scottsdale. Another thing I've noticed at both the Kierland and Old Town locations is that the service is consistently excellent. There was an error in one of our orders recently and our sweet server made it right tout suite!

Yes, the acoustics....they leave a lot to be desired. I get it: it's a rock 'n' roll sushi bar so loud music is part of the ambience. If you have a hearing loss or if you have difficulty tolerating loud music - be forewarned. I actually prefer to go when it's busier because there are more bodies to absorb the sound of the music. When it's slower, those hard surfaces (tables, glass windows) really make those sound waves bounce.
Check it out!"
DgZ-pZUo3drzpiCDlDr9IQ,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,5,"If you've read my other reviews, you know I have a soft spot for family-run businesses and this one is no exception. Having tasted a LOT of pho in my time, I have to say that this is among the best! It's wonderfully friendly proprietors and delicious options for both carnivores and herbivores! I recently had to make some changes to my dietary habits and tried their vegetarian pho for the first time today - absolutely delicious, super-flavorful, and loaded to the brim with crisp veggies. If you're a vegetarian and looking for a yummy vegan pho, check 'er out. If you're NOT a vegetarian, try the pho tai (rare slices of steak). Egg rolls and rice paper spring rolls are also tasty times, indeed!"
0nyM_mub7LxN6Dx7tYpMaA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"Rarely will I write a negative review but my experience tonight at Fresh Mint makes it necessary. I have dined here three times prior, all during relatively quiet hours. Tonight, when dining with my family, the restaurant was slammed. I understand that they are a small, family-run joint, but something's gotta give!  My gripe is not with the food but with the service and the owner's poor attitude. During previous visits, he has been able to run the dining room on his own, but tonight he was completely in the weeds.

To start, they were out of their imperial rolls, which I really enjoy. The owner was apologetic but was also completely harried by his other tables and could barely finish a sentence without being called to another set of patrons. We had a last minute addition to our table when another family member called to say he'd be joining us. We placed orders for appetizers and soup until he was able to make it to the restaurant, but the owner seemed annoyed with our table anyway.

There was also a large party in the dining room from what seemed to be a radio show that advertises for this restaurant (one of the hosts interrupted our meal to give us a flyer about it) and those patrons were loud and after finishing their meals, hovered other tables to chit-chat. It was quite distracting.

The restaurant itself is tremendously loud and they play upbeat music from the 50's and 60's. This soundtrack would be fine during a lunch rush but not when people are trying to enjoy a quiet dinner with their families.

As for the food, it's adequate. A-OK, even. But the prices are outlandish and the service is unpleasant. We will not be returning as there are many fine, veg-friendly establishments in the city deserving of our business."
cI7k9zqs_pl3byUDE4cpdA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"Most disappointing. I had been here many years ago and I remembered the food to be quite tasty. Both the service AND the food left much to be desired. I would consider the food itself to be average at best and comparable to a greasy take-out place. The lo mein was on par with a frozen TV dinner. The sesame chicken was better but not by much. The hot and sour soup was average, as well. The service was rushed. I doubt I'll be back."
pxpLVCInGwLClbnwJwxInw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"The tricky thing about King Tut's is that, while you want to love the casual atmosphere and great selection of shisha flavors for hookah, its completely packed to the walls with ASU students.  Unless you're between the ages of 18-20 and you can't legally drink or enjoy the fun Tempe bar scene, avoid Tut's if you can.  Their service is slow and sometimes a little snippity - hookah is supposed to be a relaxing and enjoyable, social time.  But with half-drunk Abercrombie & Fitch'd frat boys and disoriented college co-eds hovering over your table so they can snag it the minute to stand up, you're not likely to enjoy yourself very much.  Leave this one for the kiddies."
IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,5,"Simply the best Persian food in town! I used to live in Los Angeles and frequented the many lovely Persian establishments in Westwood. My favorite dish has always been tahdig (crispy rice) with fesenjan (pomegranate stew). I tried tahdig at another Persian restaurant in town and it didn't meet my expectations. And then I found Tasty Kabob. The tahdig is absolutely legit and I regularly get take out (worth a 15 minute drive from another city, holla). The family that owns the restaurant are lovely and treat their regulars like family, as well. Support a great family-owned business and try their fabulous food and hospitality."
dc6sPg9kNliz_Cy2yX19tw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"Shogun has been in the valley for over 20 years now.  This restaurant has gone through ups and downs and many changes of ownership, but still has some of the best sushi and japanese food in the city.  Try the Valentine Roll if you like tuna.  Try the spicy Godzilla Tails over rice or noodles if you like chicken.  It's a chill atmosphere.  But alas, I am gripped by nostalgia - it wasn't what it once was, but it'll do when you're craving a good donburi (rice bowl)."
-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,"We were really pleased with Switch! We shared the Southern Fried Chicken Pops with apricot BBQ sauce and the risotto balls. Both were excellent and were very generous portions. We also enjoyed the $3 cosmo special, in addition to their VERY impressive (and strong) Manhattans. Our server was a dream - super nice, attentive yet relaxed and very efficient. We definitely will be back."
S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"Pretty average. It seems to me that their attraction is the handmade noodles (which are good) but we tried two preparations. Thick noodle in soup with beef slices and regular noodle with spicy sauce. I did not care so much for my noodle with spicy sauce which seemd to have a really oily texture and overwhelmingly fishy taste. We also shared an order of pan fried dumpings: very large with tasty filling but required plenty of vinegar to cut the greasy coating. Overall, the food was overwhelmingly oily. I'd try again as perhaps we didn't hit the jackpot on our menu items. The boiled peanuts with daikon appetizer they bring you is pretty damn good, though!"
eDlgbI0Qg_mmI-Osvci0gw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"Ugh.  So, I'm always conflicted when it comes to Sapporo.  Yes, the Happy Hour has nice variety and generally good prices.  Yes, the crowd is consists of Ed Hardy-wearin' Bros over 40, some cougars, lots of ""after market"" parts.  But yes, the happy hour is pretty decent when you're considering the variety and prices of food and drinks.

I met up with a great old friend here for reverse happy hour. Walked in right at 10pm and sort of ambled around the hostess stand for about 10 minutes.  No hostess to be found.  Was spotted by servers working the bar area but was ignored.

As my friend hadn't yet arrived, I decided just to watch and wait at the hostess stand...try to assess the sitch.  Finally, a young woman came up nonchalantly to collect her purse from behind the stand and I had to ask her if I was to seat myself.  ""I can seat you if you want a regular dining room table.  Happy Hour is in the bar only and first come-first served.......and I'm going off duty right now.""

Weird.  Sigh.

Grabbed a high-top table in the bar and proceeded to be ignored by the server until my friend showed up.  Service was slooooow and not terribly inviting.  The tables around us seemed to get their goods much faster.

The rolls are the same, uber-American average maki they have always been since this spot opened.  4 rolls and 2 drinks on reverse happy hour came to about $40 with tip which I suppose is reasonable for sushi in North Scottsdale.

Eh, skip it."
b207RNqIAhTd4JsRsnXB1Q,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"Oy, where to begin? I struggled with how to rate this location and I echo the sentiments of fellow Yelpers: it truly does not possess the same fabulosity as the downtown location. The Pros: I called for a takeout order (beef burro, x-mas style - red & green chile) and it was ready as soon as I walked in. The Cons: I got home to find that I did not in fact get a beef burro x-mas style, but rather a beef chimichanga with green chile only. Chimichangs are, historically speaking, not my bag and since it's served enchilada style, I didn't realize it was fried until I tucked into it. I noticed the lack of red chile but decided to try anyway. After realizing I'd gotten the wrong order, I called the restaurant and spoke to the gentleman who packed up my burro. He insisted that he had given me the correct order and said I could ""bring it back for (him) to look at"" and for a moment, I thought, perhaps the error was mine. I hung up the phone and more carefully inspected my lunch: yep, definitely a chimi with green chile. I called back to speak to him and explained that there was a beef chimi with green chile sitting in front of me and he seemed surprised and offered to exchange it right away. I told him I was not able to return that day and he promised a free burro upon my next visit.

I have not yet returned and I don't know if I will come back to this location. The food is really very good but the service seemed super-rushed and when I took umbrage with my order, I was initially met with an incredulous response.  I do hope they can get it together because it would be great to have a reliable Los Dos location in this neighborhood."
G8k2E3oYHHl2o4lNJQwR-g,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,5,"In a word: delicious! The family that runs this place are always so kind and welcoming. The food is fantastic and there are plenty of options for both carnivores and veg-heads alike. I am totally devoted to their dolma (grape leaves stuffed with rice and spices). Gyros, chicken, veggie patties, and falafel are all equally tasty. The rice is EPIC with delicious almonds and dried fruits - we are picking up a platter for our Thanksgiving feast year. I always feel at home here at Eden's Grill Inn (so much so that the family knows me by name here now!)

If you're coming in on a Friday or Saturday evening, I recommend calling ahead for a reservation as they aren't a large restaurant. I strongly encourage you to support this wonderful, family-run business."
tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"Definitely have had better! I ate here at the behest of some friends who told me Autumn Court has the advantage over Desert Jade down the street. Now, Desert Jade is like a second family room to me as I've been eating there since I was a wee one so it's hard to make a case for anything but their delicious food. I tried the Hong Kong Chow Mein with shrimp - generous portion of shrimp served over pretty lackluster chow mein noodles. The tea was weak. The potstickers were  actually quite good. Overall though, Autumn Court doesn't have the same powerful flavors (and lovely memories) as Desert Jade."
2OkYkQRItlqbKw9Mz7flCA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"The food here is and has been, for many years, overwhelmingly meh. Yeah, just meh. Pollo Diablos, veggie enchiladas, and taco salads were our orders and everyone agreed that they were all very...meh. The service was good and the restaurant was clean but the food is really so average and one-dimensional."
ept9mIlqGIsemr6w0RczaA,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,"We were really pleased with our reverse happy hour experience here! We ordered lots of lovely little tapas (shrimp, chicken, hummus, feta, mozz/tomato salad, dolmades, garlic dip) they were all really tasty. The service was really attentive and the value for the food is fantastic. I have eaten at this location, as well as the one in Deser Ridge. Both serve good food but I find this one to be just a touch better all around."
yZAGhlsrmupLbrgdKm6reg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,"Don and Charlie's is a sports-themed chop house that's been a staple of the Scottsdale resident's diet for decades.  Their Chicago-style preparations of steaks and ribs is impeccable.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Schnitzel served with lemon butter sauce.  Be sure to make reservations as the restaurant does a huge weekend business.  Also, be on the lookout for famous faces, including local sports stars who like to chow down on Don and Charlie's signature ribs."
eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,3,"Solid. We hit up the happy hour which features 50% off booze and tacos for $1.50. I had the duck, shrimp, and cochinita pibil (pork). They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention.

On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $15 - $20 for most entrees. On a post-grad shoestring budget, it is certainly a splurge. We did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside."

I enjoyed a thali dinner with butter chicken, rice, pickles (mmm, my spicy favorite), veggies and dessert of gulab jamunfor about $10. I had enough for leftovers the next day. The service was pleasant and I took a lap through the market to purchase some snacks before paying my tab. There was a healthy line at the cash register of folks buying all sorts of different goodies, sharing stories/swapping recipes. I definiitely sensed a community vibe here and that made my experience all that much more enjoyable."
u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,4,"Long time patron. first time reviewer. Hard to believe I haven't given my two cents on this joint! I have been here a small handful of times. The service is good and so is the food, but from a noise perspective (I'm a noise nerd and acoustician), I cannot deal with the acoustics in this joint. I believe this shares part of the old post office but damn if it wasn't filled with hard surface decor making all that noise reverberate even more.

I'm a social eater so where's the fun if it's too damn loud to hear your dining companions? Structural criticisms aside, the food is as good as my preferred location on Central. Just like the location on Central, though, I do not care for forced valet. Blocking off all the spots and not giving me a choice with what to do with my vehicle  really grinds my gears!"
cLUoCKZGS8IJDStYsAA3Xw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"Really disappointing. Came in mid-evening with some friends for drinks and snacks. The place was pretty quiet and we seated ourselves on the patio. Service was not so great and at the end, one of the servers asked if we were ready to cash out. We explained that we weren't ready to cash out just yet and she asked if we were ready to split up our tabs. It was a strange way to rush us out so pay up we did and then we split. Drinks and fries were average."

The spring roll selection is varied and offers many options for veg-heads and carnivorous folk alike. I love their pho (specifically the pho tai with rare beef slices) which is super-flavorful. The staff here are very friendly. Parking can be a challenge, particularly during peak service time (weekends, peak dinner hour/happy hour) but fear not, there are alternative places to park and the staff are happy to point out where you can do so. This makes a great spot for a date or for a small group. Happy hour boasts great drink and appetizer specials. The restaurant is on the smaller side so you may have to wait for a table but it will be worth the wait for sure!"

The noodles are REALLY well done and the broths (tonkatsu, spicy tonkatsu and the shoyu) were very tasty and full of flavor. The toppings in the traditional style leave a lot to be desired and the pork is NOT chashu-style.

The boba drinks are nice and the service was pretty good. Overall, I'd give them another try."
AJ8DDFm6QaihAPZI3wFBHw,uZV0neUr5NefvU4o3NZBPw,2,"Nope. My boyfriend and I ended up here after dinner the other night for bubble tea. I ordered an iced rooibos tea that tasted absolutely terrible and left a lingering bad taste. The young lady working at the counter exchanged it for a green milk tea with boba (same as my boyfriend). It tasted ok but when I tasted his drink, it had a very different flavor. We then noticed that his cup was marked for a chai tea and figured that maybe a previous customer decided against the chai and they dumped it and reused the cup. Ether that or they just marked it wrong and added some green milk tea.

I ended up rolling the dice on trading in my tea for a green milk tea, as well. Mine was better because it was made from a fresh batch but my sense is that if you are a tea house marketing the boba angle, you need to have all the proper Asian flavors.

No, will not be returning."

Breakfast burritos are potato, egg, cheese, and bit of bacon. The hot sauce is great. So, if you want something just like Fili B's, only better, come to Amado's.

The rice pilaf is delicious, I also love the fruit bowls (not a fan of the pasta salad).  Chicken salad is good, but I think it needs some salt & pepper personally. Yaya's chocolate cake is really yummy! All in all, I enjoy this place!"

I'm not normally a fan of wings but these were really good. My fiance, who is a huge wing eater, also loved these.  The pizza I wasn't too crazy about because the ""thin crust"" is really just a TORTILLA!!! They were not skimpy with the toppings at all, but really? A tortilla? I'm looking forward to trying the regular crust... hopefully it will be real pizza! Definitely worth it just for the wings though! And 6 bucks for a dozen, you can't beat that! There is no dining room, so take it home folks! ***EDIT*** Just tried the regular crust pizza... MUCH better. Especially for the price, you can't beat it."
UHMnvEITSspCVWTGRIKRaQ,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,3,"The fiance and I decided to start venturing into the unknown... this was our first stop.  Nothin fancy inside or out (but a HUGE sign that you cannot miss). Our waitress was really nice. I ordered the patty melt with wedge fries, he ordered the mushroom steak burger (or something like that) with regular fries and a side salad. And a ""what the hell"" we'll share a 6 piece order of suicide wings was tossed in at the end.

1. The Patty Melt
Really REALLY greasy. I picked it up and it was basically running down my arm. The wedge fries were AMAZING though (and I love anything that I can use as an excuse to eat ranch dressing)

2. The Mushroom Burger
Comes WITHOUT a bun (Weird. Fiance had to ask for a bun with his burger) but was really big and extremely tasty. If we go back, I'd get this and hopefully someone will be there to finish half for me since it's so large. His fries were good but I liked the thick fries better. Salad was boring, but neither of us expected much from a plain side salad.

3. The Wings
We ordered suicide. These were not suicide. They were for wimps! Although they weren't as spicy as I'd hoped, they were still really darned good.

Although my food wasn't the best, I think I need to give this place another chance since my fiances food was so good. Plus all of the above only cost us 19 bucks. We'll be back... probably on a Sunday or Monday when they have the All-U-Can-Eat Beef Ribs!"

The sushi was overpriced, the cold rolls came out warm, while the one ""cooked, warm"" roll that came out tasted like it was covered in barely-warmed mayonnaise. GROSS. I actually cried having to pay the expensive bill for the disgusting food we received here. Would never eat here again if it was the last sushi place on earth!"

I'll order hotter next time) and the chicken fajita salad (hurt myself cause I couldn't stop eating it). Lots of different wing flavor options. I'm not a drinker, so all I care about is the food, but I know my fiance got excited because a large draft bud light was 2.50 (I guess that's good? haha I don't know). Relaxed atmosphere, but yes, I've had to go up to the bar to order my food since there doesn't seem to be a waitstaff here (that doesn't bother me one bit). I have a feeling I'll be seeing this place a lot in the future."
WOz66UuVsfc2K9GxzfDnGg,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,3,"The beans here are delicious, but too bad the bean burrito is the size of a taco bell burrito.  Chips and guacamole are very good, but they should be for 8 dollars."
NPiLy71qqXzb45k9eQOgCQ,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,4,"My fiance and I just loved the food here.  It was definitely a happening place to be... unfortunately that means tables so close you feel like you're dining with the strangers sitting next to you.  If you don't mind bumping elbows with the neighbors, and want some yummy food, this is the place! Once the weather cools off, I'm looking forward to trying the outdoor patio :)"
aw0H9O1yysoHB0JanT0Ubw,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,5,"I had high hopes for this one from the start, seeing as how I found it on Yelp, and it had nothing but great reviews... well, my fellow Yelpers didn't let me down! WOW, I will be coming here very often. I got the Chicago Gyro, my other half got the Chicken Gyro, and we split the Cilantro/ Jalapeno hummus. Everything was fresh and REALLY delicious... and CHEAP. They even had passionfruit tea and lemonade for the most amazing Arnold Palmer to ever touch your lips. Nice staff, clean restaurant, lots to choose from... you just can't go wrong!"
rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,4,"Being right up the street from our house, my fiance and I decided to give this place a shot one lazy night... the food was pretty good, the service was nice (although we got take-out, so didn't experience the wait staff). The restaurant was clean and didn't smell funny (an increasingly common attribute among Phoenix area chinese places). The chicken wasn't overcooked, the noodles were tasty, too. Not bad, Flamingo Palace, not bad."
VbqtbvvtNOe-YKA61-fSNA,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,5,"An appetizer, 2 HUGE dinners, and beer for 35 bucks.  Yes.  Lots to choose from on the menu.  Good service.  We will be back."
RztX0zV7ObHZD08SDUhI0Q,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,3,"Although they don't have the best food in town, it's not the worst by any means.  it seems to be a bit healthier of an option if you're REALLY needing pizza, too.  My vegetarian friend appreciated the veggie options here.  I will put this out there though... their breaksticks must be sprinkled with love (or crack) because when they're on the table, I just cannot control myself!"
YRy8FX66W5htql2pKL-o6Q,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,3,"As a fairly new connoisseur of Greek food, this place is pretty good. I like their pita a lot, and the fire feta is quite addicting.  The salad and rice aren't anything to write home about, and I'm not crazy about the tzaziki sauce here (love it other places)... the street gyros were decent, and the tea that they serve here is delicious when mixed with pink lemonade. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I'll be back when I'm in the 'hood."
XWafv9_J7TUOO4PbEcIFJA,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,5,"We finally found THE ""Berto's"" place for us in this neck of the woods (although it's technically not a Berto's... whatever...) Doesn't look like much on the outside, but the semi-crappy exterior usually speaks volumes about the food (in a good way)... there's something a little unsettling about a bright and friendly looking Berto's. ANYWAYS we went to this place last night. They had a lot of stuff on their menu that isn't on some other ""Berto's"" menus... like the 5 rolled taco supreme that my fiance got... rolled tacos, covered in everything that comes on super nachos (carne, sour cream, cheese, salsa... OH MY) - awesome. I got the bean and cheese burrito, which was also delicious. We'll definitely be back!"
Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,4,"This place was pretty good and our server (who was also bartending) was very attentive and nice. They have an amazing selection of tequilas, and the margarita that my mother had almost killed her (in a good way). I would def. go back!"
dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,4,"TRY THE VINO BAMBINO SALAD! My fiance and I split a Jr. sized salad quite often (yes, their portions are THAT BIG) and we keep coming back for more! Bring your friends, even if you think you can handle it, chances are the portions will be way too big for you. At least you're getting your money's worth, right? The staff is always really friendly, although since their food is made FRESH, it can sometimes be a long wait before you get the food... but it's worth it!"
89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,4,"Decent food for decent prices. Not much in the way of decor (cement floors/ cafeteria style booth tables) but who cares? The green chili is delicious, the tortillas are always soft and warm, and although the place is more often than not packed, they pump the food out fast. Yummy."
URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,1,"I was really craving chinese food today... too bad this place was NOT what I had hoped for. I ordered the orange chicken, fried rice, soup, and crab puffs. The chicken is dry and tasteless (on the menu it said SPICY however it is not spicy or flavorful at all). The rice has no vegetables or anything - it is just flavorless, oil soaked grains. The soup container was LESS THAN HALF FULL and smelled so wretched I couldn't bring myself to taste it. The crab puffs were decent, but not enough to make up for the 15 dollars worth of wasted food. I won't be coming back."
B7G_2Hx8Rx8l6oQ6K3n5Uw,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,2,"My fiance and I were excited by the menu... a little on the pricey side, but we don't mind paying as long as the food is up to par. Well, this place didn't quite make the mark. Almost thirty bucks for 2 sandwiches, one salad, and a drink is a bit extreme, especially when the ""crusty bread"" was hard as a rock and the salad completely lacked in flavor. The only good thing about this place was the tea. Oh well."
-o082vExIs0VVNSuZmiTQA,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,4,"I love Mexican food. It makes my heart go *pitter-patter* when I think about it. I've eaten a lot of it in my day. This cute little restaurant is a great go-to when you're in the area. All of the food I've tried has been very good, including the amazing chips and salsa. It's nice to have a not-so-fancy place to retreat to when the city life of Snobsale starts to bring you down."
SgPfkKWoG-23WMWQCT8ymg,m3o_za5PSmZdmkXm6MAnJg,2,"I had high hopes for this one, considering all the great reviews... too high of hopes.

I consider myself a Mexican food addict. If there were a Mexican Food Anonymous, I'd absolutely need to join.

Like a few of the previous Yelpers, I ordered the #8 combination, which was a chile relleno, beef taco, and enchilada with rice and beans.
-The beef taco was crisp, yes, but there was the tiniest little shred of beef in it. Might as well have been a fried shell. I took one bite that had meat. The rest was empty.
-The chile relleno was extremely greasy. I don't know if their oil was not hot enough to fry or what, but the batter on the outside of the rellano seemed to be more of an oil sponge than anything. Took one bite and pushed the rest aside.
-The enchilada, generally my least favorite of mexican fare, was actually pretty good. Really plain, but the sauce was the lifesaver on this one. I actually ate the whole enchilada.
-Beans were runny and flavorless. No thanks
-Rice was fluffy, but much like it's frijole counterpart, had no flavor. No thanks again.

All this for 10 bucks (granted that's not a lot of money... but it kind of is considering all I got out of it was basically a bite of taco and a cheese enchilada).

At least the people who worked there were nice.

I won't be back. Sorry."
oX7lSVsg4j7-SrSZVGWVnA,G6BFY0FY2-n6tPEDD5_Dcg,4,"A group of my friends went here to celebrate two birthdays, one of which was mine.  The service was very good.  The food was really good.  And to top off the amazing meal we had our choice of birthday desserts...seriously?  Very generous and delicious."
GzK0oXjFHmjyJDMIEJCFKg,G6BFY0FY2-n6tPEDD5_Dcg,4,"Good local place, pretty decent food, and the best cinnamon rolls ever!  I can't eat any baked goods from super markets (yuck).  I am very picky when it comes to sweets but these hit it out of the ballpark!"
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,G6BFY0FY2-n6tPEDD5_Dcg,4,"Of course homemade sausage, cheese, and pizza dough is amazing.  The wait is of course verrrrrrrry long.  Be prepared for that.  It's gourmet pizza with high standards."
VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,3,Not great. Been here twice and not impressed. The crust of the pizza is unusually chewy and I always find hard pieces hidden in the dough. The Margarita pizza is bland. There are 3 better pizza places in the area.
mj_E2SThbggt-FyUaE1DQg,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,3,"Nice atmosphere. the breakfast is good. The staff seems friendly enough.  The macaroons are disappointing.although tasty, they are a little soggier than I would prefer. The Union at Biltmore has far better macaroons than these and 2-3 times the variety."
XeUm1QS078kgjwONhul0ng,0CuIwjdRrcOsUrO-2gE-9A,5,Awesome pizza. I wasn't expecting it to be good. It's the best in Phoenix!
swX3Vj3dQsz1YlCRmwNQEQ,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"This Eddie V's migrated south from DC Ranch to the Scottsdale Quarter in February 2011.  They hit it out of the park in terms of layout, atmosphere, and energy.  Love the deep and dark wood combined with glass and soft lighting.  The bartop is a beautiful rich walnut.  It's the type of place you'd like to sit at for hours.

Really like that there is a Happy Hour every day of the week.  Had two incredible Happy Hour appetizers: Lobster Tacos and Tuna Tartare.  The tacos each had the meat from one large claw, and were incredible.  Likewise with the Tartare, ample portion of high-quality tuna with avocado and mini grapefruit slices.  Very, very tasty.

Service was great. Michelle took care of us at the bar and was incredibly friendly, timely, and engaging.  She made our experience all the more enjoyable, and she's reason enough to return.

Looking forward to returning for a full dinner!"
vBV5IbpTgUKuu2HlneE2NA,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"Nothing fancy here, but very well executed quick service Mexican food.  I've been told by numerous people that ATS has the best carne asada in the Valley, and I must say that the carne asada burrito did not disappoint.  Very flavorful beef, wonderful spices, fresh pico de gallo, and a warm soft tortilla.  This is very hard to beat in terms of quality and price."
WmHRxbW3m8cngS4e6T8Cnw,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"Cool hidden spot in North Scottsdale right next to the 101 tucked in a small shopping plaza.  Love the dark feel on hot, sunny days.  Cold beer and great service.  Lots of tvs and perfect place to watch sports.  Also, the relatively new menu and happy hour items are a huge improvement.  Really enjoy the mussels and potato skins.  Definitely worth a stop if you are nearby."
Wpd_2mn5d792KgPZUOOMHQ,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"This review is based on The Mint at night, as I haven't had the pleasure of dining there yet.

The thing that stands out the most about this place is the exceptional service you receive. I have never encountered anyone who seems to have the sense of entitlement that is all to familiar in Scottsdale. I've been welcomed by Tommy and Kathy graciously more than once, and they are always genuinely interested in what people are saying about The Mint.

The champagne bar in the unisex bathroom is unique in Scottsdale, and adds a buzz worthy element.

All in all, it's a great place to go on Friday or Saturday night, and I can't wait to check it out for food sometime soon!"
PpnHlk95jbeK261RHuXflw,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"Excellent spot.  This space was formerly occupied by South Beach.  Renegade has done an excellent job in filling the large space and making it feel warm and inviting. Service was stellar.

Interesting and tasty menu.  Lots of fresh ingredients and menu items.  Also, an impressive happy hour menu, including lobster tacos.

This is the sort of high end, yet accessible restaurant needed in this part of Scottsdale. We will be returning soon. Enjoy!"
cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"I can't believe it has taken us this long to find this hidden gem of a restaurant! We were made to feel like part of the family by the servers and George and his wonderful family. Every item we tried was prepared perfectly, bursting with flavor and piping hot. The Thai Basil Chicken is a must along with the Kung Pao 3 Seas. I can't enough great things about this place!"
5mmF-H_4emxvultbneKFWQ,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"Consistently excellent.  We enjoy the food here regularly and enthusiastically recommend the pizzas and pastas - fresh, flavorful, and crave-able.

Redendo's is a hidden gem that you should visit again and again."
5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"Visited Tanzy again last night, and they are really nailing the menu execution.  Loved the table-side mozzarella with basil pesto, roasted tomato slices, and toasted foccacia crustinis.

I ordered the Piccata-Style Monkfish, and enjoyed the combination of the capers, fresh lemon juice, white wine, and artichoke hearts.  My husband absolutely adored his Mediterranean Chicken - rigatoni, fresh chicken, asparagus, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomatoes, fresh oregano, sauteed spinach, feta cheese, and pine nuts in a butter sauce.  (I think I liked his a little more than mine!)

Also as a menu designer and a frequent restaurant diner, I appreciate the evolution of the menu design from the opening menu.  The new menus better reflect Tanzy's high quality and creative menu offerings."
k1c_bC3DK6mKg797vH1T8w,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"When a restaurant continues to produce such universal praise, we go out of our way to try it.  Thankfully we managed to get to Beckett's Table and it was simply outstanding.  Before I hit the food and drink, I must say that the service was stellar, extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu, perfect timing in table visits, beverages constantly cleared/refilled, and a perfect dose of information and interaction.

We started with the creamy grits and sausage trio and it was heavenly - a perfect blend of textures. We also tried the pork terrine (a pate), and the zucchini pancakes.  The pork terrine was rich and I loved the crusty bread, mustard, and vegetables and the overall flavors.  The zucchini pancakes were awesome, and the arugula added just the right touch to the green sauce and the light pancakes.

We enjoyed the lobster ravioli, which was a divine blend of cheese and lobster, with a soft ravioli. We also tried the pork stew and I loved the rich, deep flavor. That may have been my favorite. We also tried the sea bass with fresh organic vegetables. All fantastic meals.

I highly recommend the chocolate dipped bacon smores for dessert. We tried the Death by Chocolate, a scrumptious flourless chocolate cake and it was great. But the real treat are the smores, because they are off-the-charts tasty, and because you haven't had anything like them. It is sort of a deconstructed dish with chocolate covered bacon, freshly made marshmallow, whipped peanut butter, and graham crackers - ridiculously good, and a must-have!

Also, have to mention the very nice touch with a seal pressed into each of the menus. That is brand individualization and using touch as an additional brand interaction to intensify the experience. Very well done all around and you will not be disappointed!"
7pGWy3mR7gjMSE6x2njqPA,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"Killer food - We had the Greek omelette and the Jalapeno Pecan pancakes.  Excellent service and fantastic experience, highly recommended!"
iJi7yebXoPVXRyGqqL-v8g,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"Such a great atmosphere!  An amazing burger with killer fries and a garlic aioli sauce.  What stood out most was the superb customer service.  Cori  was an absolute joy.  She was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu  and super friendly.  Thanks so much to the entire staff!  We never wanted for anything.

Highly recommend 5th and Wine, and definitely worth a return visit!"
d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"Wow, incredible experience.  This has been on our wishlist for some time and thanks to Yelp Eats for getting us down there.  Just a wonderful evening.

Stellar ambiance, just the right lighting with a spacious main dining room but felt very cozy much like an old inn.  Loved that the bar is the center of the space because energy emanates from the bar to the tables, creating a real sense of communal dining.

Our server Gary was dynamite.  He walked us through the menu, focusing on his favorite items, and explaining in detail the ingredients and preparation and he was very influential.  Myself and a friend took his advice and thoroughly enjoyed the scallops, which were perfectly prepared.  My husband ordered the short ribs and he really loved them, especially the dried cherry BBQ sauce.  I was fortunate to steal a bite and they were delectable.  Our other friend loved the pork loin, which was also cooked perfectly.

We finished the meal with to-die-for donut holes with three dipping sauces - key lime, blueberry, and caramel-coconut.  So good!!!

Cannot say enough about Citizen Public House, and it is a must-have, and a must-return!!"
B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"Wow, such an incredible experience and our server Rick deserves much of the credit. He was amazingly knowledgeable regarding the food and the wine. We all followed his recommendations and were thrilled. The Boeuf Tartar was to die for - loved the fresh cut and pan seared potato chips that served as the base for the tartar. This is a must order dish!

A friend enjoyed the bouillabasse while I had the halibut, which was delicious. Another friend enjoyed the Steak Frites and I was lucky enough to have a taste; this is another must try.

Last, the chocolate souffle was light and flavorful, and highly recommended.  Please visit Petite Maison when you have some time!"
jz4lgoy76EUsLvhcFYgHAw,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"Hit this spot on the way home and had a quick cocktail and appetizer.  We were greeted and served cocktails promptly.  My cocktail was well made and my guest's beer was very cold.

We ordered a chicken quesadilla from the happy hour menu and it was delicious - spinach tortilla, thick tender chicken, fresh salsa, and generous guacamole portions on the side.  I highly recommend ordering this starter.

The ambiance was dark and inviting, and especially comfortable on a long, hot day like today.  Looking forward to returning, and very much recommend this spot!"
lpYFsXFrojiBZ1kbWR2lZw,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"One of our favorite spots.  Four Peaks consistently delivers superior food and drink with outstanding service.  Love all the handcrafted beers, which is to be expected from a brewpub.  But two things really distinguish Four Peaks -  food and service.  The food is inventive, tasty, and consistently excellent.  Also love the daily food specials.

The people are incredibly friendly, helpful, and service is stellar.  You will not be disappointed."
SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"Exceptional restaurant.  Ling and Louie's styles itself as where ""modern Asian meets American comfort food,"" and the menu does not disappoint.  They also offer a new drink menu, and I had the Pak Chee Martini, delicious!  My husband was thrilled with the draft beer selection and that it was very cold!  There is a ""Lou's Brew Crew"" draft beer promotion for July where you can receive a glass or t-shirt for drinking certain drafts, how great!

For food, I ordered the Buddha's Feast with Chicken (substituted with shrimp) and the flavors were full and varied. Shrimp extremely tender and the asparagus, mushrooms, and red onions were perfectly prepared; loved the hint of Thai basil.  My husband ordered the Sizzling Blackened Chicken & Pork.  Again, incredible flavors; blackening added flavor without overwhelming the chicken or pork tenderloin, and the jasmine rice on the side was the perfect complement.

No room for dessert but we had our eye on the Chocolate Volcano, which we will most definitely have on our next visit!"
vsFFbN71ehRCp46KeR5RdQ,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"A less sketchy Denny's. The Baby Apple Pancake came out piping hot and delicious and the omelets are soooo fluffy! I don't even understand how they get them so light and airy! I really liked the food, even the cinnamon raisin toast came out hot and sliced thick.

I like all the orange trees, I'm guessing they are fake but I'll investigate more next time.

This could get five stars from me but they played 4, count them, FOUR Nickelback songs in the time that I was dining, which was just way too much whiny sadness for my pancake feast."
VLDFjeqpUgWhnVuB_8GuEg,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"This place was awesome! I kept dancing whenever I took a bite of food, it was like VICTORY, I am being healthy and this is still delicious! The menu has a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options, so, just for fun, I tried to make my meal both! I started with the Harvest Chopped salad, which was very good, even though the extras definitely outnumbered the actual number of salad leaves. Then I got the spaghetti squash dish. It was not over-the-top awesome, but it came out hot, the portion was just right, and it was very comforting.

The drink options (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are also very fun! The dessert menu even comes with a tea menu! I was charmed.

I like this location better than the original one, the space feels more open because it's a free standing building with a patio all around it. It was also fun because while we were waiting for a table we could go check out the other fun Scottsdale Quarter shops!

The only downside is that this, like most Fox restaurants, is very loud because of the open floor plan. So be ready to yell at your date from across the table
(""HOW IS IT?""
""WHAT?""
""HOW IS IT?""
""I DIDN'T ORDER FISH?""... you get the idea)."
qQCsLGMncJp1xWUGnOKCQA,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"Three years ago, I checked out the new 32 Shea (named for the corner I've lived near my whole life!), and said I appreciated their presence. Well, three years later, I still do! I stopped in today for a late breakfast and coffee. During the day, I like to do work here-they have outlets and I can sit by the windows overlooking their patio, which gives the illusion of a garden, not a big old intersection!

I ordered the New Mexico Burrito, which was superb! Especially the green salsa on the side. I am also a big fan of their caramel macchiatos.

At night, I am enticed by all their happy hour deals. There's $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta night, and burger and shake night. They keep me informed of these deals on their pretty food photog Instagram page!

There's also an added summer bonus: it's nice and cool inside at 32 Shea. Something about the indie music, iced beverages, and dark walls. Whether I'm here after a YouFit workout or I've just burned my hand on my car door, stepping into 32 Shea always cools me down. So thanks, 32 Shea. I'm glad you're in the hood."
seYvTmOZGJ2IAMdfQa8pkg,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"I walked in here today and it was like a scene out of a musical. I can't even explain, everyone was so nice. They were perfectly cheery, explained all of their tea selections to me, laughed at my decision making process, and made me a delicious iced green mint tea.

I sat down at a table and made eye contact with a handsome stranger. There were actually a lot of handsome strangers, maybe a good place to find a date!

I smiled, put a little sugar in my tea, and was on my way, but not before ANOTHER handsome stranger held the door open for me and said he hoped I would have ""a lovely day.""

So I clicked my heels, sipped my tea, and went off into the sunset."

I'd love to try it all even though I have no idea what is in it. The workers are very, very nice and happy to answer any questions. It's a refreshing menu change from my usual donut places! Though I still order pastries, including awesome donut-esque things filled with jam. Yum!
They also sell imported foods, so if you're looking for a specific ingredient to make a fun European dish they may have it here!"

One of the ladies asked for something special for her diet and they cooked it to perfection. I will definitely go back to try other items. And the atmosphere has a local hangout feeling that is comforting."

1) It's locally owned, the owners are always here and super nice.
2) They have the ideal diner coffee. You know? Like endless hot coffee that's really smooth and mellow? They even sell the coffee they use and I think I need to buy some next time.
3) The corned beef hash. This is not something that jumps out at me on a menu, but it is excellent! Super crunchy and covered in three eggs. My favorite breakfast entree.
4) Chorizo gravy. This is Arizona. Eat some chorizo gravy.
5) The pancakes. These are soooo buttery. I don't want to know how much butter is in there, just let me be happy.
Eat at Joe's!"

I guess I'm a grown up now, but I still like to go when they put something new up. Right now the front hallway is covered in black paper butterflies, which is so cool! I also still love going into the room with all the twinkling lights and pretending I'm in space (If you ask the museum staff for the twinkling light room they will know what you're talking about!). The art museum was a fun part of my childhood and is still an interesting place to be.

The best times to go are Wednesday nights, when the museum is free, and First Fridays, when the art museum comes to life with the art walk population!"

WRONG. When they land on you, it is scary. Every time a butterfly got close to us we were both a little ""flighty"" (hahahahah). We were very worried about stepping on them, too, so we spent a lot of time staring at the ground. We were about half way through the misty butterfly garden when my boyfriend said ""OH  MY GOSH. DON'T. MOVE.""

There was  a butterfly on my neck. There was a butterfly on my neck! I whimpered while he took a picture, holding my neck in an awkward position to accommodate the little guy. My boyfriend laughed until it finally flew away. He kept making jokes about it UNTIL he looked down and discovered the same butterfly lounging on the side of his shorts. Then he didn't find it so funny. Ha!

Once we got our courage back and made peace with a few butterfly landings, we really enjoyed finding the different types of butterflies and hanging out in the garden. We got some nice butterfly pictures, too. So, yes, this is a great date place for me. Good memories."

Anything that has the word ""Fez"" in it is good- especially the burger! Sooo juicy and delicious! The phyllo pockets are great, they come out warm and are packed with delicious chicken! Also, you will have no choice but to order the sweet potato fries (sprinkled with cinnamon) when the smell of an order of them comes wafting toward your table! They are super yummy!

It's crowded, but finding a place to sit doesn't seem to be a problem!"

I'm vegetarian, I want good vegetarian food, I go to Green, I find it adequate but not overwhelmingly amazing, and yet... I keep going back. I'm still holding out hope that Green will one day knock my socks off, it just hasn't happened yet.

That last two times I have gone, my food has been cold, especially the french fries. Cold french fries are not good, people. Nor are they difficult to make. Last time I got the spicy po-boy, which I found a little bit too spicy, and overly salty. The bowls are better, I love the thai peanut bowl, it's one of my favorites! Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things.

I've been a bit disappointed lately, but I will keep going back for the concept, the cool couches, the awesome drink and ice cream selections... what can I say? It's a vegetarian dream."
GQxpWDw3MuCwAMV9BA-62w,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"Oh have mercy. Every time I am in Phoenix I NEED to go to the Gyro House. No menu required... I just order the lamb gyro. It comes with a basket of thick, hot fries that I continue to burn my tongue on. I never learn. The gyro is flavorful with just the right amount of yogurt sauce and red onions. The lamb is cooked until it's a little crunchy and the pita is always soft and chewy. Mmm. The place itself isn't that charming, but the family who runs the place is very nice. I am glad to give them my business!"
uNA3OAcroBXuxZuGDlqLhA,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"A true big city deli- huge sandwiches and endless combinations. Even the servers seemed ""New York"" (one of them was definitely packing a gun?). They have several flavorful vegetarian sandwiches as well as the standard meat offerings!

The atmosphere was also fun- lawyers, cops, fire fighters, and citizens on jury duty!"
o9IvrLWtTt5lCYqO-uiJLg,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"I've been here several times, it's my dad's favorite. He likes to imagine he is a gruff cowboy who rides his horse up to Harold's to enjoy the huevos rancheros and giant stacks of french toast.

It's fun to be pretending by breakfast time!

I know that Harold's is lively at night but the breakfast is pretty awesome, too! The food is pretty good and you get huge quantities of it! On prior visits I have worked my way through the breakfast enchilada, the southwestern eggs benedict, and a large stack of pancakes. All food comes out hot and with a smile!

Definitely a fun place to take visitors (or yourself) and reminisce about the old southwest."
NPiLy71qqXzb45k9eQOgCQ,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"$4 burgers on Mondays! Check it out. The $4 is the Bistro Burger, a standard burger with all the fixings. Unfortunately, cheese will cost you another dollar, and so will substituting sweet potato fries (but they are soooo worth it, oh dear lord, upgrade to the sweet potato fries and do a little dance while you eat them).

Sitting outside on the patio, looking at the tall buildings surrounding you and the light rail with its friendly beep as it passes by, it feels just the way Phoenix should always feel, like a hip metropolis instead of a sprawl!"
HpRsWkYHu-pumsZ4O_Linw,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,Had the basic char burger and I thought the flavor was fabulous. Perfectly cooked   The bun was nicely grilled and condiment s on it didn't overpower the great taste. French fries were just right and hot! I will definitely be back!
OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"I went back to Lux the other day and sat at the bar. I told the bartender I didn't want soda and I didn't want alcohol. He made me this amazing concoction of lemonade, a fresh lemon, cherry flavoring, and fresh mint. It was delicious! I told him he should put it on the menu. You should go order one so he will actually do it.

Also the fact that I was doing my college homework at a bar made me laugh, but they said they're used to it and all the med students come there to do homework and drink."
XbkpdDXhunFhAWLNRAiVIw,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,2,"Went in here yesterday to check it out because of the ""People Love Us On Yelp"" sticker in the window. That sticker has never led me astray before this experience!

Yes, the menu was extensive, the staff was friendly, and the place was clean, but I was completely underwhelmed. I had a gyro and it was decent, but could have used more veggies on it! Although the restaurant was clean, it was not very inviting, maybe it was the lighting or 90s decor? Not sure, but it was odd to be eating in a place that was completely empty. Overall it just could have been a better experience.

Also- humorous sighting of the day- ""fish and chips"" is listed under the vegetarian part of the menu :)"
GqWBT6OcQ9FXTyQ3eegpZg,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"As a vegetarian, this is probably the best place to go in all of Phoenix! It's nice because you can take meat-eaters there too. They do meat and tofu, and it's delicious either way! I got the thai wrap last time and it was wonderful! But everything on the menu is great, plus the fresh fruit side is yummy and healthy. The new location is really cute, you can sit outside on the funky patio and have a wonderful time! Plus, parking is way better than it was at the first location. Way better."
5ykOWYZ44sUvu9qxD8rPeg,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"I went into Il Bosco for lunch and found that my party was the only group in the restaurant (okay, we were getting lunch at like 3 pm, which I guess is weird). This actually turned into a charming experience. We talked to the owner for a while and he told us the story of how he got his start.

He served us himself, and the food was fantastic! Super fresh, and we got to watch them make our pizza in the brick oven! We ordered the Biaggia pizza off the lunch menu, and it was topped with figs, prosciutto, cheese and arugula. Totally excellent combo! The Bistecca sandwich, with steak and mushrooms, was also good. Menu items were simple but fresh and clearly from high quality ingredients. I loved talking to the owner as well, it seems like this whole place was made with love!"
5DT2qxCkXxUKW7z_4kOXmA,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"I haven't been to Sala Thai since they added a whole new room of dining, which is saying something! The added seating means there is usually no wait. I'm back to say that I still love it! The basil friend rice wins awards for a reason, people, but the pineapple fried rice is good, too! However, it is very very spicy. Take the 1-5 scale seriously, I air on the wimpy side. My friend had the spicy pumpkin basil, which was pretty good, too. The menu is extensive, and I'm still perusing!

Everything on the menu can be made vegetarian, just request tofu or no meat. I wish they listed this somewhere on the menu instead of shunning you to the tiny vegetarian corner, which doesn't feature anything spectacular. I got the pad thai and found it a little lackluster.

The boba is wonderful, and wonderfully huge. I enjoyed the taro last time!"
fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"Dragon Palace has been my family's go-to Chinese food place since before I was born, so it will always have a special place in my heart. I think I had my birthday dinner here for at least 10 birthdays in a row. Nothing changes in Dragon Palace-- the menu, the decor, the workers all seem stuck in a time warp in the strip mall's corner. But that's what makes it awesome! I will always remember the teal walls and the red booths.

Ok, enough reminiscing. Food- you should get the hot bean curd. It's listed in the vegetarian section, which is a total lie because it involves a lot of pork. But man it is tasty, and spicy! Tofu magic! The mushu vegetable wraps with plum sauce are also delicious and a waiter will come to your table and make them for you, which is fun to watch. Also, the free tea is awesome! It just adds to the whole experience.

Definitely a long time Phoenix establishment, don't be fooled by the boring outside, go check it out!"
89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"Confession: I went to Carolinas at 9 am this morning for a tostada. I say it was a good breakfast. Also, in the early morning the restaurant is actually quiet! It's almost nice. Anyways, I'm glad they are open earlier, but I still haven't tried any breakfast options there.

Carolinas is not pretty. It was a chinese restaurant, which become clear as soon as you walk in the door and see the crazy colors and zodiac symbols. The kitchen is wide open and it's always packed with people, so it is very very noisy!

However, if you are willing to brave the atmosphere, the food is darn good. I like the beans more than any of the meat products, so I stick to burritos and tostadas normally, but every once in a while a chimichanga is worth a try."
r6apfvgfl9lCFEjpnXnnxg,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"Nice lunch specials and a fun downtown location. Very close to the Van Buren and Central light rail stop. I got 1 slice and a side salad for about $8. The salad had lots of ""extras"" and was way more impressive than the average side salad. You can also select any slice of pizza you want. They have specials that change daily."
zuVvDYJkKAbXQTTBauAqJQ,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"Rebecca's reviews: parent edition. My parents watch a lot of food network, so they insisted we stop in! This place is oh so cute. My parents were pleased, they said they couldn't see the restaurant decor around Guy Fieri's spiky hair on the tv.

Anyway. The food was good! Especially the waffle dogs, basically a state fair deep fried breakfast sausage. Delicious. The eggs Benedict was done to perfection. My dad says ""the eggs properly drained when pierced with a fork"" and ""good amalgamation of flavors."" My mom says ""Tom! Who describes things that way!?"" I got the chilaquiles, which were the only ""meh"" of the day. We came to the consensus that they could use more eggs and salsa.

Overall a good breakfast with many more interesting menu items I want to try. Would you go back? ""Yes!"" Mom says. ""If she says so,"" Dad says."

Unfortunately, my sushi was not. It felt a bit gummy in texture which made me think it was not all that fresh. It tasted fine and I felt fine afterwards, so I guess it was ok. Still, I could not get over the texture!"

Oink is a friendly, peppy place to go for breakfast. The food is pretty good, the place is happy, all-in-all I would say this is the perfect place to wake up in the morning!

The only irksome quality was our server, who seemed very nervous, checked on us at weird times, and said ""you're welcome"" too often (I didn't know that was possible, but it was).

I enjoyed the jalapeno (!) bacon and the oink french toast. The cinnamon rolls were also tasty, but my group was disappointed by the eggs benedict. I would say the food could be better, but it's just awesome to have a local breakfast place somewhere in my neighborhood now!"

We tried the burger and the roasted eggplant pizza. Both were very good, the ingredients seemed fresh and high quality.

They have a great pizza and wine deal going on right now, it sounds like my next date night!"
b83NNHvvWQk-DTTzs-3WLA,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"Welcome to the hood, Which Wich! You are a welcome addition to our lunch line up.

How it works: a station of paper sandwich bags is up front. Pick your wich: vegetarian, beef, ham, chicken, seafood, or the wicked (many meats and cheeses!). Choose the corresponding bag and check the boxes on the bag for the toppings of your choice. There are many unique toppings to choose from, all the standard stuff plus olive salad, carmelized onions, dried cranberries, spicy sauces... The list is huge! Most are free of charge. Take your bag up to the cashier and check out!

The verdict: good stuff! We especially liked the house chips. The bread was pretty average. A few toppings got lost in translation from bag to sandwich maker, I'll attribute that to this being a new restaurant. It's a bit noisy inside so we preferred their patio seating.

Good new spot! I'll be back!"

This is a dude establishment. But it's delicious, so it's ok! They even have veggie burgers, but you might be made fun of for ordering one when you could get the huge burger with grilled peppers and bacon on it. Manly!

Real men pay in cash or they don't get food at all."
L2p0vO3fsS2LC6hhQo3CzA,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"I've heard about this place for so long we had to try it! We got here at 10:30 and waited about 15 minutes, which is not too bad... maybe because it was a weekday? I have practically heard war stories about waiting in this line, so I was pleased.

I had the griddlecakes and they were huge (like, grab a friend to help) and tasty. Real maple syrup, too! Yum! My man-panion had the Big 5 sandwich. The onions gave it a fab flavor. It was an interesting mix of soft bun, crispy onion, salty bacon and eggs.
Our other brunch guest had the special of scrambled eggs, sausage, cheese and peppers. Wonderful mix of flavors, too!

We thought all tasted wonderful and will make a point to come back!"
OvG9pbudLhmLkjrttGvhAQ,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"If I could I would give this a 4.75 or something, but yelp doesn't believe in decimals! Firehouse subs is certainly my new sub stop. They give you less options than other sub places (white or wheat bread--that's it!) and you don't really stand at the counter picking toppings.

But the subs! The subs are so good! The Italian is especially spectacular. The veggie sandwich is also awesome with mushrooms and melted provolone cheese. They steam the subs to warm them up, which makes the bread a little bit fragile, but still good.

Oh and besides that, hearing them all yell ""welcome to firehouse"" when you walk in is the best!"
kblFxfo_xnMUZF0U0aGXQw,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"This place is awesome. Everything is so professional yet quirky and I love it. I could spend like 30 minutes reading the menu because of all the little hidden jokes on it... including their continuously updated plea never to touch their blinds (which, you totally should when they aren't looking, because they are made of cool beads!).

The sushi is all fresh and tasty and very cheap during happy hour (10% off everything, 50% off some rolls).

I am not saying you should mention the word underground to your server but I am not saying you shouldn't either, and if you do you may be rewarded with very delicious menu options..."
apdb7MGnmnx6nGWBJ0ch_g,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"I went back to Copper Star today. I ordered a vegan apple cinnamon muffin, which was much better than the pastry I had last time. The cinnamon was oozing out of it and I never would have guessed it was vegan!

The staff was also super friendly today, and they helped me choose an iced green tea (which came in a 7/11 Slurpee size cup...dang!). It took me an hour to sip the whole thing down but there's no rush here! It seems like a good place to hang out!"
cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"I took my friend from Mexico here and she just laughed at me. ""This is such an American thing to do,"" she said, ""taking the most unhealthy things from different cultures, then smothering them with cheese."" I didn't hear any complaints in that sentence, really. Chino Bandido is an all-American idea. It's like a bacon and peanut butter sandwich, a deep fried oreo, a Coney Island hot dog eating contest.

It's just genius. The jade red chicken on it's own is wonderful, but pairing it with black beans or putting it in a gooey cheese quesadilla just enhances the whole experience. And, though my foreign friend laughed, she was happy to box up the leftovers for the next day!

I think the icing on top of this patriotic cake was really the warm snickerdoodle that comes with every meal. My friends have this crazy rule that you smash the cookie with your fist, because it's really fluffy and it makes it bigger if you squish it down a little. There's really no science behind it, but maybe we can start a trend?

This is a true Phoenix essential, and a silly and fun place to take out-of-towners, or just yourself when the mood strikes!"
TtbCOwOpNNzE7fW5CFwyng,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"These are the best donuts I have ever experienced in Phoenix. They are very fresh and doughy (duh, I guess..) and come in many different varieties. The buttermilk donut was very unique, I would recommend it. The old fashioned donuts are also very good, although a little dry. In the end, my favorite is always the chocolate sprinkle donut!

They are open 24 hours (drive-thru) so it is kind of hit and miss with freshness- I think they make new batches as needed, so some donuts on display are fresh while others are not. The inside part is open until 10 pm (even on sundays!) so this is a good random late night escapade."
aXsmmtepl0JZNcl3pkXqww,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,4,"I'm a fan of sandwiches...and not plain sandwiches, neither. I want all the fixins, unexpected toppings, and bread options you have to offer! Sacks delivers in these essential categories.

First, they have two killer vegetarian options. The Impressionist has every awesome thing on it, ever (avocado, cucumber, sprouts, cheeses, cream cheese, mayo...), and the grilled cheese was delicious as well. I picked pepper jack and swiss cheese for mine, and it came out so ooey-gooey. Yay!

This place is decidedly college. Just a plain little sandwich shop, some indoor some outdoor seating. I imagine those ASU-goers love it, but I also saw a lot of business people using the pick-up option. Good sandwich spot in Tempe. Oh and most importantly, your sandwich comes with a cookie!"
B7G_2Hx8Rx8l6oQ6K3n5Uw,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,3,"I like Sauce! It's like an odd remix of a fast food restaurant. Loud, bright, and fast, but at the same time hip and full of tasty Italian food! I think the funniest part is that there is a television inside and it is always tuned into Food Network. Sometimes I watch it when I'm in there and it's like ""Look! Here is all this other food you could be eating!""

The pizza comes on a super thin, crunchy crust and is satisfactory in flavor. The mac n' cheese is super tasty, although I could probably make it at home if I really tried. My favorite stand-out item is the goat cheese, artichoke, and mushroom bruschetta appetizer, although I could probably also make this at home (not that I ever would have thought of it!). It is such a great combo of crunchy, warm bread and soft goat cheese!

The food comes fast and is pretty affordable! A good place to grab a bite to eat if you're in a bit of a hurry."
kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"I have to say, this is really amazing Indian food! I went on a weekend for ""bottomless brunch"" which includes as many appetizers as you want, an entree and dessert for $12. I went in with a friend on Saturday around 1. The place was pretty empty and relaxing for a Saturday afternoon! The server was incredibly friendly and made some great suggestions. Here is what we got:
-Chickpea Ceviche. A must. Delicious, refreshing, and much needed in between spicy bites!
-Seared tofu. Also really good, though maybe not tricky enough to pass the carnivore's test.
-Vegetable samosas
-Lentil cake towers. Definitely my favorite thing that we got. They were served warm and had delicious yogurt sauce on them.
...and those were just the appetizers! Basically I was blown away by everything that was put in front of us. Couldn't recommend this place highly enough, what a great neighborhood spot!"
8nP8ghEpT6WFcM6tfqAaGA,LiYTbjMx1reOO_53W93L8w,5,"Yum yum yum. Why sit at a bar in Old Town Scottsdale when you could be sitting at the Sugar Bowl counter on a Saturday night? What? I'm a nerd? Yes, yes I am. But everything on the Sugar Bowl menu is amazingly delicious and tastes so fresh!  One scoop of their ice cream is a HUGE amount, so when I want an ""extra fancy"" ice cream dish I grab a friend or two to split it with. I had the Desireme Banana Split last night and it was great, but very large.

The whole place is covered in old fashioned pink stripe ice cream, pink booths, pink paintings, etc. The only downside is the bathroom, which is not pink, just dirty. Also, they don't give you napkins unless you ask and there aren't any on the tables, which seems kind of silly, for an ice cream joint."

Basically, I am dumb for passing this place by for years before finally going in. Behind the star shaped cinder block exterior is a heart of gold (and pizza!)."
VLDFjeqpUgWhnVuB_8GuEg,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Ate an early dinner here on Sunday before our scheduled movie at iPic.  The interior reminds me of Jamba Juice - same color scheme.

Our server was Caitlin and she's very knowledgeable about the menu items.  She recommended the grilled shrimp spring rolls as a starter, but apparently that item is very popular and they were out.

We opted to start with the Thai shrimp dumplings ($11), which consisted of diced shrimp, basil, mint, and jalapeno.  The dumplings were served in a sweet and sour sauce, which I believe was made out of fish sauce (think Vietnamese nuoc cham).  The dumplings were light, refreshing and very good.

I ordered the red chilli shrimp for my entree ($18), which consisted of gai lan (Chinese kale), spinach, Shiitake mushrooms, and sesame noodles stir-fried in a spicy sauce.  This was DELICIOUS!  Just the right amount of sweet, salty and heat. The shrimps were huge and cooked perfectly.   To be honest, I was surprised at how ""Asian tasting"" this entree was.

My friend ordered the spaghetti squash casserole ($13), which consisted of shredded squash, tomato, zucchini, and loads of mozzarella - baked to gooey goodness.  I'm not much of a cheese gal, but the couple of bites I had of this was pretty tasty.  I liked the consistency of the ""squash spaghetti"".

I enjoyed the dinner experience here and left feeling like I did my body good.  ;P"
UBQRhqRMW4Sk7kSZvZ1iAQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"I'm a huge fan of French macaroons and was so excited when I found Essence Bakery!  I was craving the lemon macaroons I normally get when I lived in L.A. and had despaired of finding a bakery in Phoenix that offers these treats.

I've only tried Essence's macaroons and eclairs, so can't attest to their other menu items.  However, their macaroons are TO-DIE-FOR!  (see pics)

Although a bit pricey at $3.25 each (large), I feel the price is worth it as the baking process is a bit complex.  I've tried all the flavors (French chocolate, caramel cream, espresso, raspberry, pumpkin spice, and lemon) and must say my favorites are the the espresso and caramel cream.  The fillings are a bit on the too sweet side, so I usually scrape a bit off.

The macaroons are made up rich and creamy filling sandwiched between dense and chewy almond paste cookies.  Don't mistake these for the coconut-flake based macaroons...not the same thing!

The place is small and seating each time I went was full, but I normally just order to go anyway.  It sucks that Essence Bakery is only open until 3pm Mon-Sat, but maybe it's a blessing in disguise as too much of a good thing will ruin my womanly figure.  ;-P

If you're craving French macaroons and Essence happens to be closed, Trader Joes have mini-macaroons in their frozen food aisle...theirs is also good!

If you want a coffee fix, Starbucks is in the same lot...and there's a drive-thru!"
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"Went here last night for dinner with some friends, and must admit that the food lived up to the hype.

We drove there separately and surprise - now they offer FREE valet parking (of course tip the valet dude).  Our quoted wait time for a table was 1.5 hours, and apparently this was nothing compared to the wait my friends had to deal with before (3+ hours).

We spent time next door at the bar by ordering a bottle of wine and a cheese plate to share and before we knew it, the wait was over.

Although the restaurant isn't big (and we were almost friends with the tables next to us just because it was so snug in there), there was a nice ambiance - especially with the huge woodfire oven in the back.

We ordered two Caprese salads and three pizzas - the Margherita, Wiseguy, and Biancoverde (we added roasted tomato slices to the Biancoverde for an extra charge).  O.M.G. - the food was SO good!  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  I'm usually not a fan of pizzas with thin crusts, but these were awesome.

Apparently they make their own mozzarella, which is probably why their Caprese salad ($9) is one of the best (if not the best) I've had thus far.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were sliced thick and tasted SO fresh, the basil was fragrant - and EVOO - YUM!

The Magherita pizza was $12 and the other two were $16 each.  Our food came within 15-20 mins after we placed our order, and boy - the pizzas were so fragrant!  They were decently sized and were enough to feed our group of six ladies.  The Margherita and Biancoverde tasted good, but my fave was the Wiseguy, which was topped with thick slices of roasted onions, mozzarella, and thick slices of fennel sausage.  The sausage tasted a bit too sweet, but overall, each bite of the pizza slice was food nirvana.

My friend ordered a Wiseguy to go, so the bill (2 salads + 4 pizzas) came to $88, and we added a 20% tip to that.  Was the food worth the total bill?  Yes!  Will I come here again?  Yes!"
UY13CTgUqriT-fMxT2APLw,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"So glad I decided to stopy by Khai Hoan last week.  I recently moved back to AZ from L.A. and was on the prowl for a Vietnamese restaurant.

Service was quick and our food arrived within 15 minutes of our entering their establishment.  My daughter and I ordered the same item (pho with beef meatballs / $5.25 each) and Thai iced tea ($2.50 each).

The pho broth was so flavorful and fragrant!  I normally cannot finish a bowl of pho, but this time around, I piled on the veggies and inhaled the pho within 5 minutes LOL

The place is open 6 days a week, from 9am-9pm (closed Sundays).  The menu has a mix of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes, with prices ranging from $6.25 to $7.85 for their entrees.

I look forward to returning soon to try their goi cuon (spring rolls / $3.25), cha gio (fried egg rolls / $6.25), and the com tam dac biet (pork chop, beef, shredded pork, and steamed egg meatloaf over rice / $7.50).

I'm spoiled with the diversity and quality of restaurants in L.A., so I'm hunting around the PHX metro area to find quality Asian restaurants.

Anyone know of any Malaysian restaurants in the PHX metro area?"
bKxKPGmkwH-Q-GSbt7chNA,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,2,"We had reservations at Geisha across the street this past Saturday, but since the wait was about 1.5 hours, we ended up at Stingray.

The three of us shared a few dishes, as follows:
* house salad ($5) - had a couple of bites, nothing special
* beef yakitori (2 skewers / $9) - cooked medium and very tender, but would have been bland without the three sauces on the side
* scallop dynamite ($9) - tried a bite and found the scallops to be overcooked and the sauce too tart
* mango tango ($13) - liked the combination of the red eye tuna, chunks of mango, greens, and light sauce (would have been better had the tuna been fresher and chopped into smaller pieces)
* sea urchin sashimi ($17) - the serving here is more generous than I've had at other sushi restaurants, and although not the freshest I've tasted, was more than adequate to satisfy my craving
* Nabeyaki udon ($19) - good flavor
* California roll ($5.50) - I never bother to try this

I tried the Japanese Tease ($9), a drink made with citrus vodka, green tea extract, colpico, and lime juice. This was too sweet, and I barely tasted any vodka (or green tea). Although pretty to look at, definitely not worth the price.

We also shared the green tea tempura ice cream ($7), which came with three pieces - perfect for our group. The others raved about this dessert, but I found it to be nothing special. The batter tasted too pasty, for lack of a better word. I'm also not a fan of green tea, so this may have something to do with my less than enthusiastic reaction.

Our server was Sarah, and although a sweet gal, we didn't see much of her during our time there. Stingray is a nice looking restaurant, but I've had better sushi at Kabuki (Tempe) and at my fave place, Roka Akor (Scottsdale)."
emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Used to go here often for dim sum and have enjoyed the experience each time.  Although dim sum is served daily, I've only visited on Saturdays and Sundays.  Gets VERY crowded after 12pm, so try and arrive by 11am if you want a chance at the fresher selections.

Love their egg tarts, beef tripe, short ribs, mango custard, shu mai, sugar cane shrimp, and fried rice balls (with seasoned ground pork filling).

Be sure to try and ask for a table near the aisles as sometimes it's hard for the ladies to maneuver the carts in between tables.

Prices are decent for each dim sum item.  We sometimes order a couple of dishes off the regular menu, to supplement the smaller dim sum items.

Since PHX doesn't offer alot of dim sum options, C-Fu will remain my top choice for dim sum cravings."
h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Went again last night with two friends with the intention of catching the 8pm showing of The Campaign.  (Yep, had Groupons to redeem again.)  Unfortunately, most of the shows were sold out and we went with the first available one; the 8:30pm showing of Premium Rush.

The place is definitely more packed in the evening than in the morning/afternoon.  We got our tickets around 7:40 and hung around the bar until called to the waiting line for our show.  Apparently there are three lines and staff will make an announcement when the line is open for your movie (usually 20-30mins before show time).  Oh yeah - if you pay for reserved seating, you don't have to wait in line.  You'll be escorted by staff to your seat(s).

I noticed there are more staff in the evening and they were quite busy throughout the show.  We ordered three skinny coconut coladas ($9.50 each), the chopped salad ($12.25), the Build Your Own starter, and three sodas (to use up the free drink tickets).

The coladas were good and strong enough.  The chopped salad and BYO starter were decently sized, which was a nice surprise.  The dressing for the chopped salad was good and with the fresh ingredients, made each bite good (could have done with less blue cheese though).

For the BYO starter (we get up to four items), we chose the coconut chicken tenders, spicy drummettes, burger bites, and smoked ribs.  You basically get a half order for each.  We got a decent portion - three dummettes, two burger bites, three smoked ribs, and four coconut tenders (also had a big side of ranch).  I was surprised at how tender the ribs were and how tasty everything was - definitely worth the $15.25.

I enjoyed both experiences at SMC and will be going back."
4Fylkp8eS2FD9-53eycqLw,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Ate here last Friday and although I was tempted to have sushi, I forced myself to try something new... and went with the miso-sake marinated sea bass ($23.95).  The dish came with a decent sized fillet of grilled sea bass, grilled broccolini spears and some (surprisingly) tasty fried rice.  The food went well with my glass of pinot grigio ($7), and although the fish wasn't as fresh as I thought it could be, I was still satisfied with the order.

My friend ordered the sweet-chili glazed salmon ($18.95), which came with a generously sized grilled salmon piece, grilled broccolini spears, fried rice, and green onion curls.  I took a bite of her salmon and found it to be tasty; there was a little kick because of the chili glaze.  (See photos)"
_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Went here with the Supper Club in November for a 6:30pm dinner. Our table ended up being downstairs, and we had to go through the kitchen. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance downstairs - candlelit lighting, cozy ambiance, and menu specials written on the chalkboard (felt very New York).

The waiter was prompt in arriving to take our drink orders and to offer suggestions. I opted for the Prosecco ($10) since they didn't offer Moscato.

We started off with the Roasted Garlic Plate ($16) based on the waiter's recommendation. I expected the garlic taste to be overpowering but it was quite subtle, especially when it was spread over a piece of bread and topped with the cheese sauce. I don't know where they get the garlic, but those things were humungous! (The garlic was almost the consistency of butter, the way it was roasted.)

For the entree, I opted for the Pasta Heidi ($15), which consisted of green chile linguine, chunky slices of grilled chicken, and a chipotle cream sauce, served over a grilled tortilla. The plate came out piping hot and smelled so good! The pasta tasted so fresh and although I can handle spicy foods, this dish had my mouth burning. I could only handle a few small bites before I got full; had plenty of leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.

Two of the gals ordered the special of the night, something with bone marrow, an enchilada, a tamale, and a side of what looked like fettucine alfredo. The other gal ordered the Chimayo Chicken ($22), which is stuffed chicken breast with a side of asparagus. I took a bite of this and found it pretty spicy (stuffed with poblano chiles), but delicious!

We shared a chocolate dessert, which is decently sized and enough to share between five gals. I could only handle one bite as it was too rich and chocolatey.

Our waiter was very attentive, knows the menu, and provided very prompt service."
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"St. Francis, you have a new fan! Went here last night for our monthly Supper Club dinner and enjoyed every minute (we spent a good two hours here).

We reserved a table for nine at 6pm and were seated by 6:15. We ended up with a large table in the corner near the kitchen. The table had a mix of four chairs and two long benches, so that was interesting (table was sort of too high though). Three in our party couldn't make it, but that was a blessing in disguise because it afforded us the chance to spread out and be more comfortable.

The restaurant's design is a mix of modern, trendy and rustic (brick walls and benches) that blended nicely together. Loved the ambient lighting - very cozy and romantic! This is a great place for dinner and drinks with friends (inside) and for a date (patio area).

Our waitress Meschelle was one of the best servers I've encountered at any restaurant. She was very attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the food and drink options; her suggestions were spot on.

To start, we ordered a bottle of the Clean Slate Riesling ($35, a white imported from Germany), the parmesan risotto ($10) and the baked goat cheese ($10). I loved the Riesling - it was light, crisp, slightly sweet, and very smooth. The BCG came out first - the crostini was too hard and the baked goat cheese, pesto and tomato sauce was too tart. The risotto was plated nicely and tasted even better. I loved the caramelized brussel sprouts, cippolini onions and the slices of cajun ham; each bite was lovely. One of the gals said it was cooked too al dente for her, but it was fine to me.

Next we ordered a bottle of the Catena Malbec ($43, a red imported from Argentina). The wine is a beautiful, deep red with a full-bodied, smooth flavor - which went well with my entree (the prime hanger steak, $24, cooked medium well). The others ordered the Moroccan meatballs ($15), pot roast ($19), roasted chicken ($17), and two of the roasted salmon ($22 each). My steak was served on a bed of whipped (mashed) potatoes, veggies (arugula/sliced boiled potatoes/slices of artichoke) and topped off with a red wine sauce. Other than the boiled potatoes being too al dente, my entree was SO GOOD. (I think the steak would have tasted better if I had it cooked medium.) I tried a bite of the Moroccan meatball, pot roast, and roasted chicken; all tasted great! The pot roast was so tender and full of flavor; the best pot roast I've tasted thus far. This will be my entree of choice when I visit again. Everyone gave the food two thumbs up.

Next we ordered a bottle of the Hullabaloo Zinfandel ($39, a red from Napa Valley). The wine is a beautiful deep red, but too full-bodied for my taste - especially since we're moving on to dessert. I wanted to order the Moscato to go with dessert, but was outvoted - wah, wah. We ordered the chocolate spice cake ($8) and cheesecake in a jar ($8) to share. Although the spice cake was presented beautifully, and was served with maple pumpkin gelato, I was not sold. The initial bite of the cake was full of chocolate flavor, but then the spice hits the palate and it was too strong. However, the cheesecake in a jar was AWESOME! I tried only one bite, but savored each burst of flavor. What made the cheesecake great was the almond crumble.

Our bill came to $297, not inclusive of the 20% gratuity we added to the bill. Not a bad price to pay for great food, great wine and quality time with friends. ;)

Thanks for reading my mini-book Yelpers!"
8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"Went here with the Supper Club in September for a 6:30pm dinner. This is now one of my fave restaurants.

Since this place doesn't serve alcohol but offers a BYOL option, one of the gals brought two bottles of white wine for our dinner. ($10 corking fee)

We started off with the Brie brulee ($12), which was warmed and served with a side of caramelized apples, toast, a sliced pear, a strawberry, and grapes. I could have eaten a plate of this and called it a meal; simple, but so delicious!

We ordered three entrees, the Alaskan halibut ($34), lamb shank ($24), and the pork tenderloin ($26). The halibut sat on a bed of mashed potatoes and was topped with a roasted red pepper sauce and shrimp - and was served with grilled vegetables. The fish was flaky, light, and tasted like heaven. The pork tenderloin was cooked and seasoned perfectly - very moist! I'm not a fan of lamb dishes, but the lamb shank was pretty flavorful - and not gamey as I expected it to be.

We usually skip dessert, but decided to try the chocolate torte (flourless). The torte was topped with fresh vanilla ice cream, a side of chocolate drizzle and raspberries - loved the mint used as decoration.

Our waitress was very attentive and made us feel at ease. The owner came by to talk to us and took some pics for us, before and after our dinner. The ambiance of this place is AMAZING - very European. There is even outdoor seating."
rZvBlC4yHQZtodZBsxb3nw,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"Been here a few times for lunch with co-workers and I am a definite fan.  I've only tried their penne with artichokes/kalamata olives in pink sauce, but the dish has tasted great each time.

During lunchtime, for the price of $9.00, you get a choice of their misto or caesar salad in addition to a lunch portion of the pasta in ""pink sauce"".  I've added chicken (for an extra $3), but the pasta tasted fine on its own.  The misto salad is also a good size and has always been fresh tasting.  Even though the menu describes the pasta portion as ""small"", to me it's like a full-sized entree.  Between the fresh bread (free), the salad, and pasta, I've always had leftovers for dinner.

My co-workers have tried the fresh tomato/mozzarella/basil pasta and the mushroom/sausage/pepperoni pizza.  We agree that the quality, taste and portion size of the dishes we've tried warrant repeat visits to Neapolitan.  The service here has been efficient and professional.  (See photos to get an idea of the items we've tried.)"
-Bdw-5H5C4AYSMGnAvmnzw,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"Went here in August with the Supper Club for a 6:30pm dinner. This place was hard to find as it's located in a residential area. I passed it several times because the exterior doesn't look like your typical restaurant facade - and there is a school down the block! I must admit, I yelled at my GPS several times for seemingly directing me to the ""wrong"" place each time ""she"" said ""destination!"" - ha! I got a prime parking spot in the small lot next to the restaurant (there is a larger lot across the street).

We were a group of five and were seated in less than 15 minutes. The interior is rustic and for some reason reminded me of a log cabin in Canada - go figure. This is not a large place, so this and the dim lighting added to the rustic and cozy ambiance - a good place for a date.

Our waiter was very attentive and met every need. We ordered two bottles of wine and the following food items: 1) cheese curds; 2) rosemary goat cheese bruschetta; 3) mac and cheese; 4) summer gnocchi; and 5) veal meatloaf.

With the exception of the bruschetta, my impression of everything we tasted was ""Wow!"" The cheese curds had just the right balance of creaminess from the cheese and saltiness - no sauce needed! The mac and cheese was unlike any I've tasted, not made with typical cheddar but a mix of white cheeses. The veal meatloaf was very flavorful and moist. My fave is the summer gnocchi - I remember thinking this was the best gnocchi I've had thus far. The gnocchi had the appearance of being pan-seared, and the tomatoes and basil really added to the ""summer"" and fresh taste.

We spent a good two hours here, and although our bill for the food and bottles of wine came to under $100, we paid $150 - our waiter even told us we paid too much! lol A place that provides great food, service and ambiance deserves the extra $$."
hRL_qCrcu9UL773su0QabQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"I've been here a few times with family and friends and have enjoyed the dining experience each time.  Plenty of free parking since it's located within the Tempe Marketplace.  (It's right across the Barnes and Noble Bookstore.)  The most we've had to wait for a table (even on busy Friday and Saturday nights) was 30 minutes.  Even though it was a turnoff when I once overheard waiters discussing the amount of tips they hope to receive from customers, service was professional and efficient overall.

1)  Sea urchin sushi, aka Uni ($7.50 for two pieces) - I've had it twice at Kabuki and both times, the Uni has tasted fresh!  Uni is definitely an acquired taste, but man, is it good!  It's an explosion of flavors and textures... at first light and creamy, then sweet, and then briny.  I love having Uni with sake or their lychee martinis ($8.95).

2) Dragon Specialty Roll ($12.95 lunch / $14.95 dinner) - This is my favorite roll at Kabuki.  They are very generous with the eel pieces.  The roll is shaped like a ""dragon"" and the eel is so delicate it practically melted in my mouth!

3) Paradise Specialty Roll ($10.95 lunch / $12.95 dinner) - This roll is very pretty to look at, and even more delicious to eat!  The roll contains a mix of mango, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and a few other items within the roll.

4) Dynamite ($8.95) - Baked clam, scallop, mushrooms and other veggies in a mayo sauce.  The dynamite served here is just ok.  It was a bit on the salty side and I even tasted a hint of curry powder.

5) Seafood Yaki Soba ($9.95 / lunch) -Soba noodles stir-fried with shrimp/scallop/calamari & veggies in a brown sauce.  The dish had good flavor and the portion was generously sized."
f1KNYRXm8fxIjb6rVdyk7Q,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago.  The Friday night (6pm) we visited, the place was pretty empty.

Anyhow, we used one of those coupons we got through the mail, in which we can get a complete meal for two for $38.  Since there were four of us, the waitress said we can apply the coupon for two complete meals; fine by us!

With the coupon, we got:
* Jumbo Prawn Cocktail ($9.99); the prawns were cooked and chilled just right and the cocktail sauce had quite a kick to it (very good)

* Wagon Wheel Sampler Platter ($12.99); the only things I liked off this platter were the shrimp cocktail and buffalo chicken tenders

* Three orders of 1/2 Pound Cut Prime Rib ($17.99 each); I ordered mine medium rare, and it was juicy and cooked perfectly

* Top Sirloin , Center Cut ($16.99); my sister ordered hers medium well and felt it was overcooked

* Two orders of Big Mountain Chocolate Fudge Cake ($5.99 each); the actual cake tasted cold, like it was a few days old, but once we poured the chocolate sauce on it, the dessert tasted better.

If we didn't have the coupon, the above listed items would total $105.92.  With the coupon, the total was $76 (a discount of $29.92)...not too shabby.

I also ordered ""The Gold Strike Margarita"", which was delicious!

Our bill (pretax) came to $97.01, so I felt we got a pretty good deal.

Oh yeah, our waitress was really sweet and attentive...and didn't treat us any different because we used the coupon.  ;-P"

The last time I visited, I ordered the jumbo crabcake sandwich ($11.99).  I loved it, surprisingly.  The burger was packed with alot of crab and was seasoned and cooked properly.

The others ordered:
- Shrimp scampi & steak ($16.99) - good
- Classic cheeseburger ($6.99) - good

I tried a glass of their red sangria ($4) and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.

I went in not expecting much from Ruby Tuesday, but left quiet satisfied with our experience."
e-cxqDjKEHEcISP2iGcZxg,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"I'm in AZ for the Labor Day weekend and visited Blue Martini with some girlfriends last night.

I carpooled with a girlfriend that lives in Gilbert and since I was staying in Chandler, it was about a 30-40 min trip to the Blue Martini.  Damn, seems like everytime I come to AZ, it seems to have gotten bigger and bigger.

Ok, when we exited 56th St from the 101N, made a right, and then a left on Deer Valley, I completely drove past the area the club/bar was situated in as it's nestled within an apartment complex and other businesses.  It looked completely dead, but when we went further into the area, things started to look more lively.  There were alot of posers standing about outside, but I guess being that AZ is close to L.A. (CA), it's understandable, haha.

We got there around 10:15pm and the Blue Martini was already packed.  There was a live band playing some top 40 hits, and they weren't bad.  However, I wanted to dance and although the live band was nice to listen to, I wanted a DJ to play club hits.  The band wrapped up around 11pm and here comes the DJ!

Drinks here were relatively cheap, when compared with L.A. prices.  The Kami Kaze drinks/shots and red bull/vodka drinks we got were $10 each.  They don't skimp on the alcohol on the drinks at this place, which I appreciate.

The crowd was mostly Caucasian (this is Scottsdale, after all), but there was a sprinkling of minorities, including me and my girls.  As for the age group, it comprised mainly of 30+ men and women...which I appreciate, since I like a mature crowd.  However, there were a few there that were well into their 50s.  Kinda weird seeing people in their 50s looking toned, tanned, with the men in tight t-shirts.  Reminds me a bit of Miami and L.A., which isn't exactly a good thing.

Anyhow, Blue Martini is a great spot to chill with your friends...and for hookups if you're into a mature crowd.  Not too much room for dancing, but hey, we make room wherever we go.  ;-P"
whAwdYVty-jSNRhrYT2zHA,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Been here a few times, the most recent of which was Wednesday evening for their annual crawfish broil (offered Wednesdays and Thursdays through March and April).  The seafood here is pretty fresh and service is usually top-notch.

I'm not a fan of crawfish, but my friends always rave about it, so I gave it a shot. I played it safe and ordered the 1 1/4 lb option ($7.95) while they ordered 2.5 lbs ($15.90).  I ate about four of the crawfish and sorry folks, still not a fan.  The seasoning was too spicy and salty.  I ate the corn and gave the rest of the crawfish away.  I'll stick to crab, lobster or shrimp  - more meat.

I ordered the jumbo lump crab cake ($13.95) and shared an order of the P.E.I. mussels ($10.95). The crab cake was delicious - kudos to them for not skimping on the meat.  I was not a fan of mussels before Pappadeaux, but now I'm hooked and always order their P.E.I. mussels.

This place seems to always be packed, regardless of which day of the week it is."
ALn_0f-Usn3n0a9WBcjhhg,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,4,"Went here tonight, liked it a lot. Great selection of appetizers and good flavors.

The two reasons it's only 4-stars are 1) the music is slightly too loud to have a conversation on a normal, not-yelling level, and 2) the actual dinner menu is a bit small.

Waitstaff is nice and polite and attentive."
pPNcs_59jNiQSs0Yq13bGw,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,3,"Really cool place. The food was alright. My friend had the Jack Daniel's ribs and I had the Jack Daniel's burger and a salad. Typical ""Friday's"" type food, nothing special but not bad.

The view is awesome, though. We went and had no idea that it was IN the stadium itself with a view of the field. We went after the game was over and there was plenty of seating. I'd probably come here again or on a game day, though it's a little more because you pay for the table (50% of it goes towards your food costs though!)"
vBV5IbpTgUKuu2HlneE2NA,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,4,"I come here often with a particular group of friends. I always liked their food but once I went paleo I ran out of things to eat here...until recently, when they introduced their amazing chicken.

Now I order chicken tacos without the taco shell. So it's like chicken in a bowl, with all the sides. And it's delicious!!!

Their margs are okay but nothing to write home about. Service is always friendly and it's very clean. I go here often and will keep coming.

Definitely check out happy hour, the prices are better. Although if you get the happy hour tacos they will be smaller, which is kind of dumb and defeats the purpose BUT still. Enjoy."
PzsrU41s4-QCUdb7lua2GQ,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,3,"First, I'm surprised at the price range of ""$$"" on this place. It is extremely expensive in my opinion...though that's expected in Scottsdale I suppose.

I had the shrimp bruschetta and it was fantastic. I asked for very little cheese because I'm lactose intolerant and it still tasted great, and they listened to my request. I expected this place (from the online menu, which is either seasonal or out of date) to have a bit more choices of things to eat, especially without cheese, but the menu felt fairly limited. My friend had a salad and liked it a lot.

I had a martini here, which was super tiny and like, $10, so I wasn't too happy about that. It was really good tasting, but for the size it was kind of pricey. Our waitress took FOREVER to check in on us and take our order, and I didn't consider it to be very busy. But she was very nice.

About the atmosphere - we went on a Friday night and it was quite LOUD, even before the band started. However, it was swanky and ambient and very nicely designed. There is a band stage behind part of the bar, and the band there was great. They covered recent pop songs of an electronic nature (think Rhianna's ""We Found Love). There is a small dance floor area between the stage/bar and the tables where you eat. They went on about 9, still during dinner, and it got louder, which I wasn't a huge fan of. However, it was still cool that they had that and we enjoyed it a lot!

Also, the crowd is the older Scottsdale crowd, men and women's in their mid 30s to early 40s, it looked like. A few probably in their late 20s. I'd say the men were kind of douchey."
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,4,"Yum!

I was skeptical about going to this place because I had been there once before (about 2 years ago at least) and hated my food. However, a friend convinced me and I decided to try it again.

Well, I am glad I did! The crab puffs were AMAAAAAAAAZINNGGG. I love crab puffs and was so happy to have a vegan version that didn't taste gross. I couldn't even tell it was vegan cream cheese (I'm sure we all know it's usually hit-or-miss) or fake crab! Also, I had the orecciette pasta with the no harm chicken parm, and loved it. The only problem with that was that even though they used Daiya vegan cheese, which I love, is that they just lumped it on the top and it was impossible to spread around, so that kind of ruined the parm part.

Also, their vegan chocolate chip cookies are incredible and I couldn't believe they were vegan so I even asked again just to make sure! (Yes, they're vegan).

I will definitely be coming here again. I'm dying to try the artichoke dip and their tSoynami's!"
VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,4,"I really liked this place. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the waiter, who was EXTREMELY nice, was a bit inattentive. We had to wave him over quite a few times.

The staff was extremely friendly, the music was nice and ambient, not too loud at all (I went on a weeknight, when there is no belly dancer or loud music). The food was really good, and this is coming from a picky eater who is not a huge fan of Indian food.

The dessert was AWESOME, and overall, for the enormous amount we ordered for 2 people (I have plenty of leftovers!) the price was fairly good. I was surprised at how low the check was.

I will, say, though, it was a little hard to find. It's off in the back corner of the complex."
TK4nUh28mp1rJAgA3hQCUQ,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,2,"Yikes! Talk about getting off to a rough start.

First of all as a restaurant this place is a mess. It took forever to get seated just to be told we had to hurry and order because the kitchen closes at 10. Which is fine, but it took 20-30 to get a table and if we hadn't ordered our food the first time our waitress came round we would have missed our chance as she almost never came back to check on us. Then they got half the order wrong so my friends had to wait. I ordered the chicken and waffle sliders and they were AWFUL! The friend chicken was burned and hard and over battered and barely edible, the waffles were as rock hard as the table and without the syrup it would have tasted like nothing. Do not order these you will regret it. My friends did like their truffle fries though. And the manager did comp my food which I appreciate.

The dance floor is pretty small, and this place is not a place for dancers like Denim is. It's mostly couples and groups of dudes coming to drink and watch - which is fine if you aren't a serious dancer. The music is okay, the lighting of the unused stage is kind of obnoxious, and again, don't expect room on the dance floor. If you want serious dancing, stick with Denim.

Lastly the service at the bar was pretty bad. You could see the chaos and disorganization and beware they charge more for a double drink than 2 singles so it's not worth it ($7 for a Jameson and ginger single, $19 for a double???). I will say their mule drinks are delicious though...just expect to wait forever to get one.

Definitely not interested in going back here unless things change but I doubt since just opening they're going to get rid of all that ""standing around space"" and expand the dance floor...oh well, so disappointed."
QMI6A2H1N3SwKU69SiASJA,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,5,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. I discovered it before it opened and met the owner (the lovely Abdul) and told him I would be back, and I meant it! I took 3 friends here during lunch time on a Saturday and it was absolutely wonderful. Abdul is a great host, bringing out various courses to share between us all. I wish I knew what they all were! The veggie salad/dip with the pita bread was delicious, along with olives in oil. We decided to order the lamb couscous and the bastilla (my FAVORITE!) and even though I don't like lamb, I found the couscous delicious. The sauce was phenomenal and the veggies were cooked to perfection. And the bastilla!!! I want to eat this every day. He then served us these delicious smoothies and cookies for dessert. Literally everything I tasted was yummy. Not only that, but it came to about $10 per person. Well worth it in my opinion!

We plan to go back here very soon and I can't wait!!"
HyzHidtQXC4JIULtSbk3NA,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,2,"We ordered 3 different things (pasta, chicken and rice with sweet potato, and I forget the other) and nobody was very impressed. The staff was friendly though and the place was clean, but I wouldn't come here again. Lots of options though."
G60mnTWpe1J13fWhIGlmxA,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,1,"You know why they're so ""fast"" at making sandwiches? Because there's no toppings except like, lettuce, onion and tomato. Boring.

Also, these places are way overstaffed. And they're not very knowledgable. I have food alergies I have to watch out for, and I went in the other day and asked what was in their ""special sauce"" (whatever it's called) on their tuna sandwich.........there were SIX (6) employees behind the counter and they all just looked dumbfounded. Shouldn't your employees know what's in the food?? Annoying. So I stuck with my usual turkey.

Anyway, to the food. One thing I LOVE about this place is they make ""unwiches"" which is like a sandwich, but instead of bread, it's a lettuce wrap. This is great for me because I can't eat bread, but sometimes I really crave some turkey and salami on a sandwich.

Small tip: if you don't like a TON of mayo, make sure to mention it, because they load this stuff with it otherwise.

The food was perfect temperature wise and the delivery man was a nice older gentlemen who was very friendly :) The shrimp low mien was SO GOOD. Loved the flavor. I also ordered the chicken in plumb sauce and it was great! I am a very picky eater when it comes to chicken and I had no problems with this. It was free of fatty parts and not dry at all.

My only 2 gripes with my order:

First, the crab puffs were large, which was good, but they weren't filled enough. And it mostly tasted like cream cheese and no crab. That was a bit disappointing.

Second, the way they do their delivery portions is weird...there is about half of the main dish you order and about half of fried rice. I didn't even ask for fried rice...so that was kind of a bummer. I wanted a bunch of low mien and instead I got about a half order of that and the rest was fried rice. :( Next time I will ask them about this. So, just beware!

Either way I will definitely be ordering from this place again the next time I decide I want Chinese food delivery!"
umrDQGRNied77aVg29_fVw,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,5,"How have I not reviewed this place yet even though I've been here like 7 times?!

This is some of the best food in the valley and if you haven't been here yet you are MISSING. OUT. I have some food sensitivities so I haven't had any of the sauces and just get plain chicken, but it's SO PERFECTLY cooked and delicious, and doesn't take a long time to get once you order. Plus the donut options are plentiful and always great. The one with the passion fruit glaze is the winner for me, but I've liked everything I've had. But seriously, if they have passion fruit when you go, you gotta try it.

Also every time I'm here the staff is just so friendly and personable. It makes me enjoy going here all the more. Looking forward to my next visit!"
FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,4,"I LOVE this place. The burritos are the best ones I have ever had - and are completely original. Black beans with all sorts of squash, spinach, corn, etc.

I am a really picky eater and they are always happy and willing to take out the things I don't like (pico de gallo, ew!). The first time I ever went to this restaurant, our waitress knew EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT to that burrito and was extremely friendly.

I definitely recommend going during the day, though, because it gets crowded at night and a little loud. It also can turn a little ""scottsdale/snobbsdale"" at night, and this is coming from someone who lives here. Also the wait time can be pretty terrible sometimes.

Either way, I wouldn't skip this place! I love it."

Update #1: I asked an Irish friend of mine for his ""take"" on Rula Bula's. I didn't want to lead the Yelp community astray... He says it's the best Irish food in town! So, I guess you can take that to the bank.

Update #2: A friend and I were dining at Rula Bula's when a patron behind us starting choking. I gave the heimlich a whirl, but not having the best upper body strength, stepped aside when the professional help arrived (first a very nice cook and then perhaps a manager?). Anyway, heimlich was successful, and everyone went home safe and sound (after eating the rest of the meal, of course). Hey, that's cool.

I even brought my younger, hipper friend to Cartel to make sure my evaluation was fair, and she now makes a face whenever I mention it!

As others have noted, be prepared to wait a while for service and don't be afraid to go get your waiter if you're feeling abandoned. Also, there may be a wait for a table, and the environment is loud, so be prepared to shout a bit if it's busy.

They have beer-tasting on certain nights. I did not partake, but my Dad (who was visiting AZ) did. The food varies in quality (or perhaps just varies in quality of recipe?). My Orange Table friend and I shared a 'special' pork chop dish, and that was pretty blah. However, I highly recommend their grilled cheese sandwich on some sort of yummy bread (the lower end cheese sandwich ~ I have yet to try the fancy one).

As for breakfast, I don't recall it being particularly spectacular, but I think it was better than your average diner breakfast. I may have to go back to try again... The flavored iced coffee seems very evil and full of calories, but it is really quite good. That did stand out!

Orange Table is recommended if you want a place to chill and chat with your friends. Just try to find out what others are eating so that you pick something good from the menu. : )"

Over the years, we've been disappointed with NYPD, Rosati's, Oregano's, and Nello's. Ray's, Lorenzo's, Barro's, and Spinato's were better.

Classic Italian Pizza lives up to the Yelp-hype. CIP specializes in 12"" thin crust pizzas. You get a high quality, slightly chewy yet crunchy thin crust pizza with a well-spiced sauce and top shelf Italian toppings (the sausage was delicious!). The brick oven bread appetizer recommended by previous Yelpers comes with a plate of olive oil and marinara that is great for dipping your pizza crusts into...In terms of portion size, my hubby, his friend, and I split two pizzas and a bread appetizer, and that was enough for fairly large appetites. And, finally, the service was awesome, as was the ambiance.

TWSKXlz2niDh9Pyuj90Dng,wQ7nlVwAKuEit9EOdU4QFg,4,"I've eaten at Engrained twice. We like to call it, lovingly, ""the frou-frou restaurant at the ASU MU.""

Engrained claims to be a ""living-learning restaurant committed to locally grown food and environmentally friendly practices."" Eh, whatever. So far, it all tastes good, or else I wouldn't bother yelping...

The first time I ate at Engrained, I partook of the prawn spring rolls with a peanut sauce. I have to assume that someone in Arizona is growing prawn in a vat, but that's cool. It was really, really good!


Today I enjoyed, and I quote, ""Lamb and Feta Patties with Cucumber Tzatziki Parsnip and Potato Puree"" for $10.95. The meal comes with a drink (soda, tea, coffee), so that's really not a bad value for what you are getting. The meal consisted of one good-sized lamb patty with feta cheese mushed into the patty, on top of a yummy mashed potato base with a few string beans and cherry tomatoes. I think there was actually a pesto sauce on the top of the tzatziki, and it sure was delicious!! Portion size always seems adequate, without being overwhelming - a nice change from chain restaurants.

I haven't tried the sushi bar yet... Sushi ""grown"" in Arizona? Hmmm...

Anyway, do give Engrained a try, and try to guess what part of Arizona your food came from! : )"

I-WaaqvofK2YSS4agaPKjQ,wQ7nlVwAKuEit9EOdU4QFg,3,"Having a husband from Cajun country (Lafayette), we decided to give Chez Monieux a try. Hubby ordered catfish with okra and hush puppies. I had the red beans and rice. We also ordered a side of dirty rice. After a little wait (reasonable for the food), our food was served. Catfish was nicely breaded, non-greasy, and well-cooked. Okra was lightly breaded, more lightly than most places, but quite good. Hubby didn't let me try the hush puppies, so they must have been excellent!

As for the red beans and rice, they came on a GIANT flat plate, with a large amount of beans, a fair amount of sausage, and a somewhat small serving of rice, plopped next to the side of the beans. Now, I'm no Cajun, but this is not how red beans and rice should be served. The rice should be on the bottom, and the beans should go on top... That being said, the taste of the beans was decent (although not as mushy as red beans normally are), and the sausage quite good, so I wasn't too disappointed given that this is Cajun food in Arizona.

Finally, the dirty rice... Well, let's just say, this isn't the dirty rice we expected. It was white rice with red and green peppers. Dirty rice is called dirty because it has pieces of chicken liver or giblets in it. I know that sounds a bit gross, but it's authentic and really tasty! So, skip the dirty rice at Chez Monieux .

Chez Monieux's service was very friendly, and everything looked clean enough (though somewhat spartan). I think it would be more lively on a night when they have live music (we actually sat on the stage). Anyway, I'll give them another try with friends, and this time I'll order the catfish!"

We stopped in at just about 5pm on a Sunday. The decor was lovely for the holidays ~ a big fancy tree up front, lights and decorations throughout, and some classic Christmas tunes. Service was very attentive, and we were provided with our drink selections and dinner bread quickly. For dinner, I ordered the tortelloni with a pesto cream sauce for myself and lasagna for my hubby. Each entree came with either a choice of dinner salad or minestrone soup. The salad with Italian dressing was zippy with lots of vinegar, a few beet slices, a pepperoncini, and a few black olives. The tortelloni were giant with lovely ricotta inside and a quality pesto cream sauce. My husband reported that the lasagna was quite good, with a bit of sweetness to the sauce and some nice sausage. We also liked that the server left a small dish of parmesan cheese for us to sprinkle on top of our dishes.

All in all, we were very pleasantly surprised by the high quality food and recipes as well as the great service at Riazzi's. Parking was easy and ample in the private lot, and I appreciate the outdoor courtyard with fountain that you walk through to enter the restaurant.

Are they gone now?

OK, for the rest of us, Culver's is a family-friendly fast food joint, and their Butter Burger is pretty good. As other reviewers have mentioned, the burger is not the same as In-N-Out, but I get sick of the same old burger. I like some variety, and this is a good-tasting, fairly high quality burger. It's a bit unique because they butter the inside of the bun and press the beef patty until you get a slightly toasty outer edge on your patty. As for the sides, the cheese curds are not that great (A&W has better), but the onion rings are good. I haven't tried their crinkle cut fries yet, but I hear they're pretty good. Eh, from now on, I will just get a single Butter Burger and a small custard; that's more than enough food for one person!

I will probably visit Culver's every month or two just to try something new from their large menu. The service is VERY good and VERY friendly, the restaurant is clean, and there is a nice LCD where they show sports games. However, you shouldn't bother coming to Culver's unless you like ice cream. The custard tastes a lot like soft-serve ice cream, but thicker and richer. The different flavors of custard mixes are fun, but avoid the brownie bits (eww!). On the other hand, the turtle mix was really good with all those nice roasted pecans.

Give Culver's a shot. Just skip the sides and save PLENTY of room for dessert"
GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ,wQ7nlVwAKuEit9EOdU4QFg,4,"We eat at Cracker Barrel about once a month or so.

So far, the Dobson restaurant beats the Chandler one by a mile. We like to eat out late (open until 10pm Sun.-Thurs., 11pm Fri./Sat.). However, after 8pm or so, the Cracker Barrel on Chandler likes to run out of staples (like chicken and dumplings), but not tell you until they bring half of your meal out. ""Oh, did we mention that we're out of the one thing you wanted?""

Personally I love the fried catfish with crunchy cornmeal coating, green beans, mac & cheese, and fried okra. If you're in the mood for breakfast, the pancakes are good as well, and the bacon is thick cut and well done. I recently discovered that the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon meal is really cheap compared to a full meal. While I'm not a fan of the biscuits, lots of sausage gravy makes them edible enough. The cornbread is almost as bad as the biscuits. Apparently some people like both, but I can't see it. Cracker Barrel coffee is not that great either, but I drink it anyway. : )

My husband likes the chicken and dumplings above all else, although he'll eat the fried chicken from time to time (DANGER: it's heavy!).

All in all, if you like Southern cooking, you should give Cracker Barrel a try."

Thus far, I have tried both the Chicken Pot Pie pasty and the Cottage Pie pasty (the ground beef version of Shepherd's Pie). The Chicken Pot Pie pasty was just alright, but the Cottage Pie version was pretty darned awesome... Frankly, I was a little afraid of the ""ground minted lamb"" in the Shepherd's Pie, but maybe I'll try it next time, after drinking a cider to start out with. Did I mention the Strongbow Cider is worth a sip, or two, or three? (I like the fact that they have 3 sizes of Draft Beers, so that I don't have to special request a small glass...)"

However, the atmosphere seems fun (kind of loud, but that drowns out our usual loud talking). There are flatscreen TVs throughout the restaurant, in case a game or a major weather event (hurricane season) is on. The booth seating is comfy, and we see a lot of families, so it looks pretty kid-friendly as well.

I've tried various dishes here, such as sliders washed down with BJ's Hefeweizen. The sliders and thin fries were pretty darned yummy, and the 5 oz. taster-sized Hefeweizen was the perfect size (and price!) for a lightweight and/or someone who has to drive soon thereafter... I am not a beer connoisseur, so YMMV! On separate occasions, I've tried the Angel Hair Toscana dish, which was just OK and came with a side of garlic bread. I've had the French dip on a couple occasions, and that is highly recommended; I love a good au jus... The other night I tried the Field of Greens salad with candied pecans, feta, red peppers, and a balsamic vinaigrette; that was quite yummy. I coupled that with a taster-sized Berry Burst Cider, which is really sweet and hit the spot.

For dessert, the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good, so you might want to save room for that (be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2)! The Apple version pales in comparison ~ don't bother with that... Finally, I'm a caffeine fiend, so I was pleasantly surprised that their coffee does not taste like old socks.

Eating at the clubhouse in the winter season is especially lovely, since they decorate the entire area with festive lights and a large, beautifully decorated Christmas tree. At a recent December event, we selected a buffet which included vegetarian tamales, string beans with red potatoes, rice pilaf, and glazed carrots. There was also a turkey carving station. I'm very picky, and everything was excellent. The carrots in particular were really yummy with a candy-type glaze on them, but everything was above expectations.

It's not 5 stars.  But it's pretty darn good.

I know it just opened around Christmas time.  We were in once the first week and it seemed like they were maybe still getting their footing.  Couple stumbles, but nothing unforgiveable.

We've been back a couple times since and I've been very happy each time.

The decor is very nice.  TONS of giant-screen TVs.  Not a bad seat in the house it seems.  The bar looks very sleek.  The pool tables are very nice looking and they play pretty nicely as well.  The shuffleboard table seems very short.  We didn't play it, but it just seemed like half a table.  Would love it if it were more on par with other bar shuffleboards -- but I realize they are not the most space-friendly game to keep normally.

The beer selection is great.  They've got a good variety on tap, and more in bottles/cans.  Lots of craft beers - lots of local beers as well.  I was quite pleased with that.  Each time I've gone, I've been given a suggestion of something new to try - they have not steered me wrong yet.

The food is decent.  It's maybe a couple dollars more than cheap sports bars like Zipps and the like.  In some cases, it seems worth it.

The burger was really good - had the one with fried jalepenos, etc on it.  Can't wait to try more burgers, honestly.  The buffalo wings were also good.  I'm so picky when it comes to buffalo wings, and these are good -- simple flavor, not too fatty - just how they should be.

The nachos were mediocre.  But then again, I never expect much from bar nachos, so I wasn't really disappointed.  I got what I expected from it.  There is a ton of crap on it -- the pork and chicken were nice, the chorizo wasn't great.  But I tend to prefer a spicier, pork based chorizo and I think this was a fairly mild beef chorizo.  Nothing special.  Not bad...just not my favorite menu item.

The pool seemed kind of pricey (you rent the table/balls, rather than putting in quarters).  If you play fast games because you're really good at pool, then maybe this is a good deal.  If you suck at pool like I do and games take forever...it's not as good of a deal.

The service has always been very friendly.  Nothing that blew me away, but certainly competent.

Happy hour is a decent deal - I believe it's 1/2 off appetizers and a dollar off beers (or something like that).  I believe they also do something (giveaways, etc) on Fridays if you follow them on Facebook or Twitter, but I'm not sure.

I'll definitely be back...Lucky Break has potential to get even better, so I'm hoping that others will catch on to this place and keep them in business!"
I-VD-o4JDGSG5GHQ2EbrVA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,5,"Yes, I like Smashburger.

It is not the best hamburger I've ever had.
It is not the fastest hamburger place you'll go to.
It is not trendy and fancy.

What it is, is a great sort of fast-casual (read: slower than McDonalds, faster than a sit-down restaurant) restaurant.

The burgers are high quality for a casual dining restaurant.  They have a few different varieties of burgers, all coming in either 1/3lb or 1/2lb versions.  You can also build your own using any combination of their available toppings.

Highlight of the entire meal for me :  Adding a fried egg on top of my burger.  My wife makes fun of me for it, but toss a fried egg on a burger, and I'm in heaven.  This place tosses a perfectly fried egg ontop of a delicious burger...fantastic.

The fries are quite tasty as well.  Our super-friendly cashier informed us that the fries are actually McDonalds' old french fry recipe, before they switched to canola oil, etc.  She says Smashburger bought the recipe/etc and now use it as their own.  Who knows if that's true, but it sure did taste true.  Delicious, crispy, salty...amazing.  Just like McD's used to make - you know, before they took out the trans fats, etc.  Maybe they aren't health food...but as a time-to-time indulgence, not so terrible.  They offer regular varieties with sea salt, or they have ""SmashFries"" with olive oil, rosemary, etc.  They also have Sweet Potato fries...  Hard to choose just one, as they are each great for their own reasons.  Honestly, I think the regular salted fries are my favorite, but not by much.

We tried the Smashchicken crispy too - not bad!  Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers, but it was quite tasty.  Not the highest quality cut of bird, but it was white meat and tender and pretty darn good.

Finally...the milkshakes.  Nothing earth-shattering, but definitely quality.  The chocolate was smooth without being overpowering.  They also have a ""cactus vanilla"" which is a blend of vanilla and prickly pear.  I loved it.  Subtle prickly pear flavor with a good strong vanilla.  I really enjoyed it.

The prices aren't fast food low.  Between 2 of us, we were easily over $20...but we didn't exactly skimp on anything either.  2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 milkshakes.

We'll definitely return, and I suggest you give it a shot as well."
vU8-ATy2-MASm-bQXdhRaw,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,3,"I really like Pei Wei.  But you have to understand what it is.  It is a chain.  It is not quite fast food, but not quite a restaurant.  It is rarely great, but almost never bad.  It's consistent, like most chains are.

The crab wontons are tasty, and I love the sweet chili sauce that they come with.

Mongolian Beef, Honey Seared Shrimp are a couple of our go-tos.

There are much better Chinese/Asian restaurants in the world.  There are also quite a few worse.  Like I said, it is consistent and reliable - and sometimes that's all I need.  I rarely crave Pei Wei specifically, but I would never turn it down."
vBV5IbpTgUKuu2HlneE2NA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"Long-time fans of the downtown location, we were excited to have one near home as well.  So we stopped by after work for a quick dinner.

The quality of carne asada is constant.  It's fantastic, just as good as the downtown location IMHO.

We went just a week ago, and they had just opened.  So fresh, in fact that the smell of fresh paint and paint thinner was still fairly strong.  So a negative for now, but I'd imagine with a year of constant grilling and the influx of ASU students in the fall, that minor downside will disappear in no time.

Highly recommend the America's Favorite for two (if there are two of ya!).  Gives a sample of the taco as well as the burrito along with some chips and delicious salsa.  Only wish you could get a smaller side of guac for less than $5.  But, the guac is tasty, albeit not amazing - but definitely a nice addition to the burrito.  The habanero sauce in the bottles on the table work nicely with it as well.

I'd say it's 3.5 stars, but with a bit of seasoning and experience, I'd imagine this will be a 4star easy.

I would also imagine you should take advantage this summer before school gets back in.  I can only imagine how busy this place will be when school is back in session.

BTW, for anyone who's not familiar with America's.  They do one thing and they do it well:  Carne Asada.  Don't expect a wide and varied menu.  You can get carne in a burrito or a taco.  Maybe a quesadilla.  That's all the variety you'll get here and it's alllll you will need!"
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,5,"I say 5 stars, but I truly am a fan.  But if you're reading this in the summer, you might want to knock it down a few stars.  Only misters and fans really don't cool the patio down enough when it's 110 outside.  But if you need a Four Peaks fix during the summer, head up to the Scottsdale location.  Maybe not as historic, and maybe it lacks some of the charm of the original - but the beer is the same and food is just as good up there.

The beers are great - love the usual selections, and the seasonals are always interesting.  Even when I don't love them (the Double Knot was just OK to me) they are always worth a try for the experience and the new flavor.  Kiltlifter and the Hop Knot have become my favorite regulars, but the Pumpkin Porter CANNOT BE BEAT around Thanksgiving time.  You really need to get in during Thanksgiving week to have some.

Food is always reliable.  The Popper Burger is everything that's good in this world.  Great burger, spicy jalepenos and a nice thick slab of cream cheese.  You know, if you're into that sort of thing.  Which I am.

The fries are tasty, I've always enjoyed the pizzas as well.  Some of the other offerings are just OK, but I've never had a *bad* meal here.

Service can be slow when they are slammed (and they DO get slammed), but is usually pretty accomodating.

Any complaints I have are quickly overlooked once that tasty beer arrives.  ""It's so good when it hits the lips!"""
vrpW_ZIjHvsAX3ByyeHjCA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"Long-time fans of the Mill Ave location...we finally made it out to the original (I think this was the original, anyways).

Overall, pretty darn good.

The food is on par with the tempe location.  The pastas were delicious - I really liked the Boa Bowtie pasta.

Wines were solid and complimented the meal nicely.

As with the Tempe location, the best part for us is always the Shrimp Adriatica appetizer.  We could just eat a big bowl of that with bread.  The sauce is amazing, the shrimp is well cooked.  The only downside was that it was just regular french bread (or similar) - the tempe location has the fancier, tastier varieties of fresh baked bread.  But the quality of shrimp and sauce was the same.

Service was slow at first (we went late on a Sat night as they were slowing down), but was friendly, made great recommendations and were very helpful overall.  By the end of the meal, I had forgotten about the slow start.  Think we just walked in at an awkward time, which as I said, they really made up for by the end of the meal.

Also, the warm butter cake was decadent.  Maybe not as good as Mastro's butter cake, but it's on the way there.  Really tasty, very fresh.  I could have used some fresh whipped cream or a little vanilla ice cream to go with it, but that's a personal thing.

On a side note - the Zinfandel they are currently offering (think it was like $6-7/glass) is fantastic.  I was impressed at the quality compared to the price.

We'll definitely be back."
u6xb2aUAvX6i1WhsQWqgWg,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"4 stars easy for the quality of food.  I give the downtown location 5 stars, but something about the Scottsdale location is lacking (although i'll be damned if i can put my finger on what, exactly).

But don't let that stop you.  If downtown is too far, this place is still well worth every penny you'll spend there.

The fried chicken is unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I was never a fried chicken fan until Lolo's.  Of course, perhaps that's because I grew up on KFC and Popeye's and a variety of other sub-standard chicken shacks.  Lolo's is addictive.  It is perfectly greasy and cooked perfectly with a crispy-crunchy outside and a deliciously moist and tender inside.

The sides are fantastic, and I always hesitate on what to get.  The grits are great (but how do you *really* screw up grits).  Love the mac n cheese which reminds me of something homemade rather than Kraft MacNCheese (which is great, just nothing special).  The cornbread is nice and fluffy.  The french fries come with a seasoned salt that is like a drug.

And the waffles.  Dear lord, the waffles.  Buttery, cinnamon-y (although I think there's more than cinnamon to the unique flavor) and syrup-y.  It is honestly hard to find the words to express the quality of these waffles.

I've heard the desserts are legendary, but god save me I've never made it past the meal.  In fact I think I've only finished the KK's combo #1 a couple times, let alone want dessert afterwards.

Service has been a bit spotty at the Scottsdale location, although never terrible.  We've had a couple times where we waited quite a while, but service has always been pleasant and apologetic whenever we've had much of a wait for anything.  So if the service isn't fantastic, it's certainly good and friendly.

Now I can't wait to go back.  But if you're downtown Phoenix...go to the original.  I'm not sure what it is...but everything is just a tiny bit better there."
F2F6rJ_SPo-lUhJ_AmufLA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,Great place. The ooey - gooey cupcakes are unreal. Not always a cupcake fan but these are fantastic.
2dOS56h2QueEIDAdP9-1TQ,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,3,"Not bad at all.

We've been on a bit of a pho-kick recently, so we've been trying a few new places.  Pho Ao Sen is right down the road from our house, so it's the closest one we've tried.  We had dinner there once, and we've done take-out Pho a handful of other times.

When we dined it, they were a bit busy, and appeared understaffed.  They were pleasant enough, and certainly worked hard and fast to get everyone taken care of quickly.

The pho was pretty good.  It's on par with most other places in the valley.  Good broth, I like that they use cilantro and green onion (which some places seem to skimp on -- just my preference to have more in there).

The spring rolls were mediocre.  They fell apart pretty easily and the quality was just OK.  Not bad, but I've definitely had better.

The Vietnamese iced coffee was fantastic.  It's so simple, strong as hell and sweet.  It was great to end dinner on.  (For the record, my wife didn't care for it - it was a bit strong for her tastes).

The few times we've done takeout, the pho has held very well - they give you the broth separate from the ingredients and you assemble when you get home.  I was skeptical of how good take-out pho would be, but it worked quite well.  The broth was still hot when we got home and it had a very similar quality whether I ate it at the restaurant or at home on the couch.

We'll definitely return, but it's not my favorite pho in Phoenix.  It's just SO close to home."
LxNoSrtJYB7HvP5I-8p-Ow,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"Been wanting to try Andrew's for a long time, but finally got around to it last night.  Not sure if it was the location, the mixed yelp reviews, but I was definitely skeptical about it.  Good BBQ is amazing, but bad BBQ is a supreme letdown.

Walking in you immediately smell the smoke, the meat...it smells fantastic.  The place was completely empty (which can be a warning sign at some places).  The menu was large and a bit overwhelming - it all sounds good, so we knew we'd have a hard time picking one or two things.

We had *amazing* service.  Dana was fantastic.  From the moment she greeted us, we knew we were in good hands.  We had just started perusing the menu, and she offered to give us her ""spiel""  - she warned us she did have one if we were interested.  She then gave a very thorough, but quick run through of the highlights of the menu - different options depending on what exactly we wanted.  She gave us advice and did NOT steer us wrong.

We settled in on the bbq sampler, a half slab of ribs and our sides - green chile mac n cheese, garlic mashed potatoes and spicy cowboy beans.  Oh, and cornbread.  If it sounds like too much food...it was, and I don't regret it even a little.  We were advised that it would reheat well if we had leftovers.  For the record, it reheated very well as lunch the next day.

The ribs were deliciously smoky, great flavor.  They are a little tougher than some places (think they were more St Lous style as opposed to our preferred baby backs, but that's our preference), which wasn't great, but certainly not bad.  The flavor compensated well for it.

The pulled pork was good, the bbq brisket quite tasty and the pulled bbq chicken was surprisingly good.  I'm of the mindset that chicken is the least attractive option at any bbq joint, but this was very good.  I can see how each of those would make for a great bbq sandwich (or sliders, which we were told was a good way to try each of them as well).

The cornbread was nicely moist, had a great flavor as well.

You lose a star for serving Pepsi products in my opinion...but I know others don't mind Pepsi.  We're just a Coke family and always will be.

Limited selection of beers, but they are decent - the usual domestics (Bud/Miller) as well as a selection of 4Peaks brews - Kiltlifter, 8th St Ale and Hop Knot (HK in a can!) - not to mention $2 PBR.  That'll do...that'll do.

Supposedly they have cupcakes as well, made by a former employee who still sells to Andrews so Andrews can serve them.  We didn't try them, but the flavors sounded really good.

We'll definitely be back.  It's not the best BBQ in the Phoenix area, but it's certainly respectable and definitely the best I've had in the Tempe area (by far).  Don't be scared off by the empty restaraunt.  It's worth a try.    It's 3.5 star quality, minus the star for Pepsi, add a star for Dana..."
UKmEEicyPHSiw3Nu-SrLMw,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"Has to be my *favorite* downtown lunch spot.

The food is fresh and tasty.  And the menu offers quite a bit of variety for a wrap shop.  They have some fairly straightforward wraps, and some that are quite interesting (Very Brady Clubster, anyone?).

I always look forward to seeing the weekly specials.  Sometimes they do not sound intriguing in any way.  Other times they are the best thing on the menu.  I wish a couple of them would turn into regular menu items, but oh well.

As for sides, I haven't gone wrong yet.  Their soups are always good.  The chips and salsa are quite tasty as well.  But the Pièce de résistance is the pasta salad (in my humble opinion, of course).  It's so simple, so tasty and just a bit unique.

And the service, while sometimes slow is always friendly.  They work HARD there and do quite a bit of business.   The girl up front with the pineapple tattoo on the back of her arm - she's a sweetheart and always in a good mood despite how busy they are.

My *only* complaint is the parking, which is minimal.  If you can, go early (11:30 or earlier if possible) for lunch so you can be sure to get a spot and not have to wait too long.  There have been a few times where I've driven through and couldn't get a spot and had to either go someplace else or be creative in my parking.  And when it's 110 out, I'm not so fond of parking a street or two over and walking.  Call me lazy.

On a personal note, I'm trying to make my way through the entire menu, and so far my favorite wrap: Turk-182.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed that one.  (To be fair, I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy at least somewhat.  Most have been spectacular, some have been just OK.)"
HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"I'm a big fan.  Such a hidden gem that you really wouldn't know was there unless you were told where it was.  Very understated and beautiful little area.

When the weather is cooler, it's a perfect patio for happy hour.  Dinner gets a little pricier, but not any less worthy of praise.

For drinks, their maragarita is a smooth, fairly strong tasting wonder.  The wife prefers the blood orange/peach mojito (also quite tasty).  Think most happy hour drinks are $6-9.

As for food, you will *not* go wrong with anything pernil.  Their pernil (slow roasted pork) is fantastic.  At happy hour, get the pernil nachos - we get at least 1 order everytime we go and sometimes more if we have a few other people with us.  Fish tacos were quite tasty if that's your bag.  Shrimp and lightly friend and tasty.  I can honestly say I've never tried anything here I didn't enjoy.  Sure, some things I love more than others, but there isn't a disappointment on the menu so far.

Cannot recommend this place enough for happy hour.  Great service as well."
FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,5,"Absolutely one of my favorite Phoenix stops.

The wine list is fantastic and changes regularly (not sure how often, I just know there was a shakeup since we started going there).  The wait staff is knowledgeable and well versed in the wines they serve.  They have given us spot-on recommendations about MANY different types of wines and have always been honest and true.  My wife is not a huge wine fan, but told them the couple types she's tried and enjoyed - and they have recommended a few that she has really loved.  They do not steer you in the wrong direction.  I love just going and asking for a new recommendation based on a couple things, and I find something new and tasty nearly every time!

Best value is to get there before 5pm.  All glasses of wine are $5 until 5pm.  A very easy and inexpensive way to try some new wines to see if you like them.

The food is quite tasty as well.  It seems like small bites, but it usually quite plenty for our group.  There are usually 3 or 4 of us at most, and we ALWAYS get the bruschetta.  It is fantastic.  Different flavors come with each one, which is great for the variety.  The smoked salmon is so smooth and tasty (and I don't love salmon, so I was surprised how much I enjoyed it).  The pesto is fantastic - whatever they offer with pesto, get it.  Think my favorite flavor of bruschetta is the tomato jam and cream cheese.  It seems odd but is great.

The sandwich/paninis are great as well.  The turkey pesto is great and the chicken with sun dried tomato sauce is AMAZING.  We have a hard time trying new things just because we like these so much.

Service has always been attentive and helpful without being overbearing.  Water is refilled often and everyone has been exceptionally pleasant."
j2bx_ctb_ED3zbfSaqhQmQ,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,3,"There is a lot to like about Roaring Fork, however a few hiccups lead me to a 3star review - with a couple fixes, I could easily add a star (maybe 2).

Went to Roaring Fork for happy hour last Friday.  It was a fairly warm day, although nothing like the summer days we've been having.  The bar was packed, so we opted for a spot on the patio.  We got there shortly before 5, so we were surprised that it was already that full.  That being said - easy fix, go earlier on a Friday.

The chairs out on the patio are fairly uncomfortable.  I'm not an enormous guy, but I'm also not 120lbs.  The narrow, weird shape of the patio chairs were fairly uncomfortable.  The women with us did not notice a problem - every guy did.

The overall value is great for happy hour.  Most drink specials are $5!  $5 in Scottsdale.  Hard to beat.  The Sweet Carolina (?) was a combo of Sweet Tea Vodka and lemonade - just the right amount of sweetness, very tasty.  The guava mojitos were also a highlight.  Very tasty.  The wife enjoyed the huckleberry margaritas as well.  All $5.

The food was solid.  We shared the green chile pork with warm buttered tortillas.  I'm a bit of a tortilla snob so wasn't thrilled by the thicker (think Mission brand) flour tortillas, but the green chile was very good.  Not really spicy (would have been nice), but great flavor.  The best part of the food in my opinion, was the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with tortillas.  The chicken was perfectly tender, juicy and seasoned.  Great bird.

Service was somewhat slow - but they were jam-packed, and we were outside on a hot patio, so I suppose that can be overlooked.  While they were slow, they were very friendly, very helpful and overall pleasant - just needed to come around a bit more often.

The restrooms, especially for the guys are a bit of a trek.  You walk all the way to the back of the restaurant, make like you're walking back into the office building.  Just before you re-enter the offices, you hit the women's bathroom.  The Men's restroom is actually back inside the office building - just a short walk down the hallway.  A little inconvenient, but let's be honest - I'm not going to count out a restaurant just because their restaurant isn't exactly where I want it.  I have legs, so I can walk.

Overall...3 stars.  I would definitely return.  I would love to sit inside and see if service improves.  I would also prefer to sit at a booth rather than outside on the patio chairs.  Apparently my giant ass was not meant to sit there.  The food and drink, not to mention the happy hour prices make this place more than worth it."
siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"I was torn on my rating here.  The food is 4 star easy, the overall experience is slightly less - I'd love to give it 3.5.  But the food was just that good, so I'd rather round up than down.

If you didn't know where/what the Grind was, you would drive right by.  It's a small little spot in a small little strip mall near a Fresh and Easy market.  As you walk in, you are transported...the decor inside is sleek and stylish, very modern - really doesn't feel like the same place you saw from the outside.  Flat screens across the wall behind the bar, low lights and dark wood.

The drinks seem interesting, though I only sampled one whose name now escapes me.  It was one of the gin-based drinks and it was quite smooth.

We ordered the chicken wings appetizer - a little different in that they were a bit smoky, but the quality of meat was pretty darn good.  They drizzle a bit of sauce and give you a side for dipping  - personally, I'm more of a sauce all over type of guy so that could be better in my opinion.

The food is what really impresses.  The burgers are great - the sweet and spicy burger was fantastic, with just a touch of heat and a sweetness that balanced it nicely.  I would have loved it just a little spicier, but that's me (a bit of a spice-fiend.).  We also ordered a bbq pork sandwich that was good as well - not stellar like the burger, but certainly adequate.

The fries were tasty, although nothing earth shattering.  The potatoes au gratin were the highlight.  Creamy, cheesy, buttery...quite decadent and delicious, you know, if you like that sort of thing.  If cheese and cream aren't your cup of tea, skip them.  I loved 'em.

Service was adequate, if not memorable.  It wasn't spectacular, but certainly nothing to complain about.

I'll definitely return and try a few other things on the menu..."
lBqamaoIIhsF1arl-s1aEA,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"Love, love love Lukes.

I'm a big fan of the original downtown.  The Scottsdale location is good, but not as good as the original - although it has gotten better and closer in quality as time goes on.  I feel like places like these need to be open for awhile to let the grease cook up and ""season""  the grills and equipment a bit before the quality can match the original places.  The first time I tried the Scottsdale location, it was mediocre.  I tried it again 6-7 months later, and it was worlds better.

This did NOT apply to the Lukes in Chandler.  The quality, in my opinion was *every* bit as good as the original downtown (my wife didn't fully agree, but did admit it was close).  Not to mention, the Chandler location is big, open, airy...it's new, it's clean...and not too many people realize that it's there yet.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon and there were only a couple other people there.  I can't imagine that will continue forever, but we enjoyed the less-hectic nature of it for now.

The beef and sausage combo with sweet peppers and grilled onions, with provolone...is my absolute favorite.  It is a messy, sloppy, greasy, delicious combination.  Love the ore-idea crinkle cut fries as well.

If you're a fan of the original...you will not be disappointed with this one."
Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"We go for happy hour.  I've been for dinner before and enjoyed it - but happy hour is what keeps us coming back.

The drink list is intriguing, and I've enjoyed trying new cocktails.  Think it is $2 off normal prices during HH.  The wine list is quite tasty, and glasses of wine (the ones less than $10) are half off.  Hard to beat when you can get a very nice glass of wine for $3.25-$4.  We've asked for recommendations before, and the waiters/bartenders have never steered us wrong.  They give good, accurate descriptions of each one.  I don't know a ton about wine (aside from knowing that I enjoy it), so I always ask.  Last night the waiter described one as ""fairly light, very earthy...just really good.""  It came, I sampled it.  I wouldn't have thought to call it earthy before (like I said, I don't know a ton about wine...so I don't know all the words).  But that is *exactly* what it was.  It was light, it was definitely earthy.  I loved it.

For appetizers, the prosciutto is delicious, if you like that sort of thing.  Very simple presentation with super-thin shavings of the prosciutto, comes on a cutting board with cracker, some sort of delicious sweet sauce and lettuce (arugula, maybe?).  Very tasty if a small bite.  The bruschetta was nice as well - the cherries were sweet and tasty with just the right amount of balsamic on them.

The highlight, as it always is for us...the shrimp adriatica (sp?).  It's delicious bites of shrimp in the most wonderful, garlicky reddish sauce.  The shrimp is good, the sauce is amazing.  We always get extra bread and soak up every last drop of garlicky goodness."
Z-graJvcYCSOGWRs3bDzLQ,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"I'm a fan, but you have to know what to expect.

If you're a Chicago-snob, one of those types that always talks about how much better Chicago is than every place else in the world, and about how no one really knows good pizza (or italian beef , or hot dog, etc), then you may not love this place.  It is not perfect Chicago style pizza.  You will not satisfy your cravings for Lou Malnati's here.

However, it is a decent pizza place.  The deep dish is alright, the sauce is decent and it's cooked well.  The crust is really good but certainly not great.  We really enjoy the mozzerella sticks and hot wings here as well.  The cheese sticks are cooked well, nice and gooey cheese on the inside but not so hot that you're burning off the top layer of skin from your mouth.  The wings (we usually get the buffalo hot) are quite tasty as well.  Decent size, decent quality.  We order them ""well done"" or a little crispy b/c we prefer them that way.  Everytime we've asked, they've gotten it right.

What really makes Old Chicago a destination is the beer list.  Something like 110 beers from all over the world - most in bottles, but quite the extensive ""on-tap"" list as well.  The do a ""World Beer Tour"" where they give you points for trying new types, etc.  Think if you complete a certain # of them you get a t-shirt.  It's nothing special, but kind of fun to track that you've tried so many different beers.

They also do a root beer tour for the youngins or those who aren't in the mood to drink beer.  Also a 'tini tour with a variety of martinis for those who prefer the 'tini.

All in all, just a fun place with a great beer menu.  It's not the best place I've ever been, but I always look forward to returning."
pBwOqgpkaDmFUDYX8cbnNQ,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"Definitely a place worth trying if you enjoy tortas.

We went last week on a long lazy lunch break, so we figured we'd try a new place.  We arrived shortly after 12p and the place was not empty, but far from full.  Pretty quiet actually, which I was surprised as the tortas had been very highly recommended.

The layout is nothing fancy, doesn't look like much from the outside, or the inside.  The service is very friendly and very helpful.  The guy who helped us made some great recommendations.

First off, the tortas are great.  The bread is made special for them (think it's a bolillo roll, or something like that).  But they taste fresh and go perfectly with the tortas.

We had the milanesa de res, which is basically a breaded carne - it was fantastic - the torta comes with the meat of your choice, some jalepenos, lettuce and a couple small slices of avocado.  So simple, so delicious.

We also tried the Cochinita torta, which was tasty, but not quite as over the top delicious as the other.

They have a choice of a couple sauces at a little salsa bar - the red chile sauce is mediocre, the spicy chile verde was surprisingly spicy and exceptionally tasty.  I got so excited by a sample that I piled it onto my torta and ended up sweating through the rest of it!  It is sneaky spicy!

The horchata was great, if not overly memorable.

I'll definitely be back."
Dqzkdf0sz8lm9AFjfsDmIw,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,3,"This review is mostly based off of happy hour.  I haven't really been for dinner service outside of the bar area, so I'll keep my review to what I know.

Good happy hour drinks.  Orange slice martini is fantastic, nice and smooth and just the right amount of citrus-y sweetness.  The margarita is quite nice as well, just not as much of a standout as the orange slice.  They have good prices on glasses of wine and beer as well - that being said, we always return to the orange slice.

The bar menu isn't great, but it isn't a detriment either.  Nachos are standard bar nachos with generic chips, overly lime-y guacamole and a light layer of cheese.  Nothing special.

The Prime Rib sandwich is tender and tasty.

I do love the house-made potato chips that they serve free in the bar area.  Quite tasty and nicely salted.

Go for the drinks, get a couple snacks - but don't expect too much from the food.  Service has always been reliable and pleasant if not outstanding."
TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,5,"This may be my favorite place to go, for a couple of reasons.

First off, we've been for after dinner cocktails/appetizers a couple times.  Fantastic.  The drinks, for the most part - are pricy (up to $18 for a martini) but what you should be aware of, is that they pour you a full drink, and leave the shaker with you.  So for $18 you're really getting 2 very high quality drinks.  It is absolutely worth it.  I usually order 1 and call it good.  Couple times we've gotten 2 and I've definitely felt it.  I had a 3rd once and almost didn't make it home.  The alcohol is top-shelf quality and smooth as can be.  Wife loves the cantaloupe martini (sweet and smooth).  I've tried a few different.  The CEO martini is a great, fantastically smooth martini (love the blue cheese stuffed olives that come with it - i always ask for extra).  The Manhattan is strong and tasty as well.

We've also gone for dinner.  It's pricey, sure, but really worth it.  The seafood tower appetizer can really add up on your bill, but the quality is as good as it gets in Arizona.  Very cold, very fresh, just perfect.

The bone-in filet is probably my favorite...always cooked just right.  For the side dish, you CANNOT pass up the lobster mashed potatoes.  It is absolutely decadent and swimming in butter, but it is soo freaking good.  Love the pretzel bread that they put out on the table as well.

Service is always fantastic, as you should expect from a place like this.  The place is nice, and you would fit right in wearing a suit.  Although truth be told, I've gone dressed much more casually than I should have and no one has given me a hard time."
ohEnmKpF7i2_ujme1p_vUQ,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,5,"I don't exactly know how to describe a pasty if you've never had one before.  I had never even heard of them until recently, when I read a review of this place.  Always the adventurous type when it comes to food, I figured I'd give it a shot.  How bad could it be?

It's fantastic.  At it's simplest, a pasty is a beautifully filled pastry with meat, potatoes, veggies and some sort of sauce.  Like a chicken pot pie without the tin.  But better.  Oh so much better.  And if chicken isn't your thing, fear not - they have pasties of pretty much anything you could imagine!

We went this past Saturday to try it out.  I like the decor, cool black wall, love the church pews to sit at the communal tables - also a long bar or some small tables to sit at if communal seating isn't your bag, baby.

The menu is quite extensive, a few pages worth of different pasties - a full page dedicated to vegetarian options (certainly not for me, but good to know!).  They have a nice drink menu as well, I suppose depending on what you're looking for.  They nod their head to the winos with a pretty limited selection (think there were 4 different types, nothing too spectacular).  The beer list is extensive, and perfect for the setting and menu.  Lots of american and english brews, quite the variety actually.  And with the draft beers you get a choice of 14oz, 20oz or 32oz.  All of them decently priced.  (For the record, I had a Boddingtons and it was delicious).

$3 Irish car bombs, all the time.  (plus a couple other shot/drink specials) but that one jumped out at me.

To the food.  I had the Oggie, which is described as the traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes, onions and rutabaga with a red wine gravy.  It was brought to me with ketchup or more red wine gravy for additional moist-maker if you so choose.  It was great.  Steak was tasty, not too tough (i'm sure it's not filet mignon, but it was certainly good quality for a filler).  I'm still not sure what a rutabaga is, but I know I like it, at least in this dish!  Couldn't decide what I liked better the ketchup or gravy, so I went back and forth with each subsequent bite.

The wife had the spicy Asiago Chicken.  Perfectly cooked chunks of chicken breast with a slab of asiago cheese (melted and oh-so-gooey delicious), hatch chiles, black beans.  She was quite happy with this one.

We also ordered a side of the garlic ""chips"" which are pretty much oven baked french fries - just like an order of fish and chips.

We ended on the Chocolate bread and butter pudding served with creme anglaise and vanilla ice cream.  So decadent and quite tasty.  Perfect ending.

I can't wait to go back and try new varieties of the pasty.  The options seemed limitless.  Not to mention go back and drink all their beers and partake of the $3 car bombs.

Service was good, although the pasties take a few minutes to cook.  So don't expect it to be ""fast food.""  Good food takes a bit of time to cook properly!  They told us about this when we ordered, so the delay was expected and welcomed (gave me more time to enjoy the Boddingtons!)."
M9fOuiesoUSaouOqNQ3U2w,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"I love crappy Chinese food.  I don't mean that it's bad quality or anything.  Having lived on the East Coast a few years, I miss the little Chinese restaurants - tiny little places, nothing fancy, inexpensive, that serve up good sized portions of Chinese food.  I have no idea what authentic is.  What I do know, is what tastes good.

I've lived half a mile (at most) from this place for a few years and have always wanted to try it.  Wife isn't a fan of Chinese food, so I just never got around to it.  Finally tried it last weekend and was very happy.

Very nondescript looking place, nothing special on the inside, though it did appear clean (at least from the front where I was standing).  The guy who took my order (and who I assume also served me when I went to pick up) was very nice.

I had the Kung Pao chicken, which to me seems like a very generic meal - something that is a good measuring stick on which to judge Chinese restaurants (like ordering Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant...I always try that first).

The egg drop soup was quite nice as well -- pretty thick, but very simple, very tasty.

I should be clear - it's nothing fancy.  It's not out of this world amazing.  It is good.  It is inexpensive.  It is a pretty decent portion size.  It was *exactly* what I wanted.

I'll be back...next step is to convince the wife to try something from here."
_9vGmNrEcLWFOnUzeUdfag,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"I'd say 3.5 stars, but since I can't rate half stars, I'd rather say 4 star than 3 star.

Let's cut right to it.  The ribs are fantastic.  They shine above all the other things we tried.

Went and had dinner one Saturday night.  There was quite a line, but it seemed to move pretty fast.  It's cafeteria style - you stand in line, order at the front, they hand you a cafeteria platter and you move down the line, selecting more things if you want.  Check out at the cashier, then find a seat wherever you can.  Despite a very large crowd, there was ample seating.

The ribs are the stars here.  A little smoky, nice and tender, good BBQ sauce.  Great flavor overall.

The brisket was decent, as was the pulled pork.  The BBQ chicken was surprisingly good (if I'm eating BBQ, I *rarely* get chicken because it pales in comparison to the pig usually).

Sides don't look like much, but they are plenty.  Mac N Cheese was good, as was the cheesy potatoes.  They have a giant baked potato that we didn't try, but it looks both enormous and delicious.

Cornbread is served warm with this delicious honey-butter.  Don't miss this.

Desserts were lackluster.  We grabbed the pecan brownie and a slice of lemon cake - both were very OK.  Next time I'd just end on the cornbread (or possibly try the sweet potato pie which looked pretty good too).

An interesting place to try.  Not my favorite BBQ in Phoenix, but it's up there."
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,3,"The Parlor is a very cool place, good food...but nothing earth shattering in my opinion.

The style is very modern and sleek...I love the open-ness of the room, nice little herb garden as you walk in.

The food is solid - the soup was a potato/sausage when we were there, made with a veg stock rather than a cream base, which made the soup a perfect accompaniment rather than an overbearing, heavy soup.  It was delicious and still fairly light.

We had the spicy bbq chicken pizza, which was nothing like a CPK BBQ chicken pizza - it was great.  The sauce is not over-done and is quite light in comparison.  The spice comes from the peppers that are sliced up as a topping - really pretty light on the spice (I could've used more, but this was probably an appropriate for most people Level of spice).

Overall, service was good, food was good, decor was good...for some reason, I just didn't love it."
wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"We came here on a Friday afternoon/evening right after work for happy hour.  My wife had been given a gift card for her birthday for the Fox restaurants, so we decided to spend it here.

The happy hour is very underrated, and I'm not sure why we don't go more often.

Wines are half off, both by the glass and by the bottle.  Cocktails are a couple dollars off, and beers might be half off as well.  We've had the cocktails before, and they are solid - not my favorites, but strong, well made and tasty.  This time, we opted for a bottle of wine - not a bad deal at half off - ended up being a $15 bottle of Reisling.  My wife is still figuring out which wines she likes so she asked for advice in picking one out - the bartender made a recommendation, and then poured her a sample to try before we committed.  She liked it, so he went and got us a fresh bottle to share.

The appetizers and flat breads are also half off during happy hour.  We had the bruschetta - quite tasty, although it seemed like it was served on wheat toast, nothing overly inspired.  Had the prosciutto etc been served on a more intriguing bread...it would have been perfect.  Also, the fried calamari was tasty and light and cooked perfectly.

If they don't bring you some of their fresh made foccacia and pesto dipping oil...ask for it.  It was the absolute highlight for us.

All in all, good drinks, good food, service is great...and the happy hour prices are very reasonable.  My only tip - get there early if possible if you want elbow room.  The bar area seems to fill up pretty quickly - by the time we were leaving (6pm-ish) we had people hovering waiting for a spot at the bar."
rbywwnfMjFjJwLQkgpdIEw,lr-R05ggl9wikS8DoQB3PQ,4,"Oh Rito's, how you haunt me.  I know you're not good for me.  You're really not working with my intentions of ""getting into shape"" and ""eating better.""

Oh well, you are so delicious.

Rito's is a cute little hole in the wall in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  In my younger, less adventurous years I wouldn't have stopped here.  I would have missed out.

They only have a few options - red chile vs green chile, burrito vs chimi, rice and beans or no.  That pretty much covers it.  But what they lack in variety, they make up for in quality.  It's gooey, cheesy and delicious.  My personal favorite which I get nearly every time is the green chile chimi enchilada style.  If you don't know, enchilada style means smothered in sauce and cheese.  Sure it's messy, but it doesn't get any tastier.

Don't believe there is indoor seating, so you are left either taking it to-go or sitting on their outdoor patio.  That's all well and good when it is 70 degrees out.  But 100+ with humidity?  I'll take mine to go for now.

Definitely worth a try if you enjoy mexican food.  My only other complaint is that they close early (4pm, I believe) so dinner is not an option."
3vta1BSPwdSulcCFMpBjDw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"I just moved here from Chicago where there's a huge Japanese community, so I was fairly surprised at the collection of goods sold here since there doesn't seem to be quite as large a group of Japanese people in Tempe.  The store is pretty spacious, and they sell the basic foods one would miss if from Japan like curry, udon, ramen, ochazuke, etc  They also sell some housewares and rent out a small collection of videos that have current Japanese tv shows recorded on them.  The prices are basically the same as where I'm from (which is slightly more than I'd like to pay), but that can be expected seeing as most things are probably shipped from Japan.   Still, the people are nice, the goods are plentiful, and the prices are sort of right, so I'll be back."
XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,2,"I went here with a couple of friends during Restaurant Week, and I have to say that I didn't LOVE it.  The menu was impressive with its edamame dumplings and teriyaki brown rice with tofu, but the food itself wasn't AWESOME.  It was kind of like, Ok.  I tried the place, but I'm in no rush to return anytime soon.  I also wasn't particularly impressed by our waitress.  She was a bit too perky and a bit too in-your-face about the greatness of True Food.  I love everything that True Food stands for, but there was something that was a bit snooty about the environment.  There was so much emphasis on the greatness of True Food that I was kind of turned off by it.

I will say, though, that the natural refresher drinks are really good.  I had the cucumber refresher with cucumber and honey lemonade.  Highly recommend.   Not too much cucumber taste and just enough honey lemonade that it wasn't too sweet.  Here's my overall rating:

Food: Meh.
Price: Not awesome, but tolerable.
Parking: No problem.
Service: Not impressed.
Ambience: A bit too trendy.
Chefs: Cute.

Also particularly questionable to me was: who the hell is Dr. Weil?  Where I come from, he's a foot doctor.  Apparently around these parts, he's some bigger dude that is qualified to discuss healthy living.  Hm..."
AfN3Z1U6QPEgAb5F2CQm8w,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,1,"I don't get this place.  I went the other night just for some appetizers and drinks, and though the food was decent (fried zucchini and mushrooms), the parking lot, service, music, and crowd sucked.
Parking is a bitch if you're gonna try parking in the lot.  I'd just skip it and try to find some parking on the side streets.

Before my group of friends got there, two other guys in our group were at a table, and apparently, the moody waitress (brunette with her hair in a ponytail) kept trying to get them to leave.  Maybe she thought more people weren't going to show, but still...wait a few minutes, you know?  Then, when the rest of the group got there, we asked for menus, and she comes and literally threw them on the table without saying anything to us.  When she returned to the table, she only took drink orders and didn't ask us about food.  Before we could even say anything, she had left.  When she returned with drinks, I asked if there was a drink menu I could look at since I hadn't made up my mind about what I wanted yet, and without even looking at me, she just shook her head and started rattling off ALL the drinks in the bar in one breath, which wasn't really what I was asking for.  And once again, what about the freakin' food?!  Only when she returned a third time did she finally ask us about food.  Then, later on in the evening, she started to clear off the centerpieces even before we were done because, apparently, somebody wanted to get a head start on cleaning up so she could go home early.  Well, Moody Waitress DID end up leaving, but without telling us, so when a different waiter came to finish up our table, we were all a bit confused.

Meanwhile, my friends and I couldn't help but discuss the horrible music that was playing.  And the crowd there was...interesting.  I'm not sure how to describe them.  Go and see for yourself.  Or better yet...don't.  There are better places to go in the area.  Don't waste your time here."
2kro_WXlgmk6nJlkXvN9Qw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,2,"It's unfortunate that this place wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be because I would've liked to continue supporting it (seeing as how there are not many hawaiian restaurants around the tempe area).  I ordered the chicken teriyaki meal, and my friend got the Hawaiian chicken meal.  The rice is fine, and the macaroni salad is actually quite good.  The main part of the meal, though, was kind of...fatty?  I dunno.  The flavor was actually ok, but there was something about the chicken that was NOT ok.   The chicken was definitely not as lean as the chicken I'm used to eating at other restaurants, but maybe that's how chicken is prepared in Hawaii.

That aside, it took quite a while to get our food.  The place kind of looked like the next step up from a fast-food joint, so we expected our food to come out a little faster than it did.  Granted, there was only one woman working the entire place when we went, but still...where were the other workers?  I also think the food was just a tad overpriced.  For the quality, it could afford to have been a dollar cheaper, I think.

I didn't try the boba tea, which the restaurant appeared to be emphasizing with its gigantic signs, so maybe I need to go back and try the tea.  There was a group of people who came just to get the boba tea, so perhaps WikiWiki is not the place to go for food, but it IS the place to go for boba tea (and, i would argue, decent macaroni salad)."
h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,4,"I always wonder why there are few cars in the parking lot of this restaurant whenever I drive by because this place is pretty good!  They have a menu with great variety, and for those of you unsure about Indian food, no worries.  The menu describes what's in each dish.  The portions are pretty decent as is the price.  The naan is huge, but a little crispier than I'm used to having it back in Chicago.  The mango lassi was also a little less dense than I prefer, but it still tasted awesome and was quite refreshing in this heat.  The owners appear to be kind of mom-and-pop-ish, and they're really nice, too.  I'll probably be back.

Warning: If you make your food spicy, even if you think you can handle spicy, it's gonna be spicier than you think."
Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,1,"I have seen this place on the weekend evenings all packed with people looking like they're sardines in a can, so what possessed me to go there for brunch one day?  I shall never know.  I did, though, and I have to say, the food was yuck, the coffee was watered down, and the service was slow.

I ordered the two 'specialties' on the menu, which were the Sundried Scramble with sun-dried tomatoes, basil, goat cheese and scrambled eggs and the maple-bacon scone.  Aside from the fact that my brunch buddie and I literally waited 30 minutes for the food to come out, the food wasn't even that good!!  The Sundried Scramble was something I probably could've made myself at home (and better!), and the scone was just not good.  Actually, they brought out the wrong scone at first, and when the correct one came out, I thought, I should've just said not to bring one at all cuz it was drier than what people who don't live in Arizona consider the state's summers.

Also, as my friend and I were walking up to RnR, I saw one of the wait staff lounging around with sunglasses on.  Forgive me if I am wrong, but I think sunglasses should not be worn by wait staff at a restaurant especially for brunch if you are trying to make a statement that the place is as classy as Scottsdale thinks it is.  Shame on you, RnR.  I'm going across the street to go eat at Daily Dose."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,5,"It's ironic that I would luv this brewery because I am not much of a drinker.  I think what I luv about this place is that they find a way to sneak the beer into food so that people who can't drink much but like to eat (like me) can still enjoy being there.  I also enjoy that Four Peaks is one of those laid back bars where the music isn't pounding so loud that you can't have a conversation with the people sitting right next to you.  There's good food, good staff, good service, good prices, and lots of outdoor seating, so this is a great place to go for a nice evening out with anyone.

I'm a foodie, so I want to take a minute to mention how good the food is here.   On my last trip, I ordered the grilled chicken beer bread, which is grilled chicken breast, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and cucumber sauce rolled in beer bread with a side of french fries and had ice cream cake for dessert.  Everything came out promptly and was SO good.  I want to give a special shout-out to the french fries at Four Peaks cuz they are especially tasty.  I also want to mention the stout shake to all you dessert lovers (particularly MALT lovers).  This is an item I usually get at Four Peaks because it is sooo creamy and delicious.  It's basically a malt made with half an oatmeal stout beer topped with whipped cream and Oreo crumbs.  Beer AND ice cream?  Yes please!

For an older student in a college town full of younger students, Four Peaks is a breath of fresh air.  It's a place that would not find a home on Mill Ave, and for that, I am SO grateful."
rhKzcgMm8CDhu7RZz_XxqQ,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"Whoa, great-tasting-gyro-salad!!  I went here the other day as a sort of pit-stop before heading to Gold Bar when my friend and I realized we were all of a sudden hungry.  I had no idea this place was even here, but we discovered it just driving around looking for some 'refreshing' food.  (who really wants to eat a non-refreshing greasy pizza or fast food when it's freakin' 115 degrees outside?)  So glad we did!

The place is clean, the food is good, the prices are reasonable (specials appear to be a daily thing here), and the service is pleasant and quick.  I'm sure I'll be back."
0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,5,"OMG.  This place is awesome!  At first, I wasn't sure what I was getting into as I drove from Tempe out to the country-esque suburb known as Gilbert for dinner, but as soon as I saw the neon signage and gravel parking lot for Joe's Farm Grill with picnic tables outside and the line out the door, I knew I hit the jackpot.

As I stood waiting in line and trying to figure out the system of ordering for JFG (it's not confusing at all.  you just order like normal.), I saw posters up of Guy Fieri, the guy (no pun intended) from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network.  Apparently, he had been there to tape a show on JFG and feature their onion rings (which i then promptly ordered, which were not only good, but HUMONGOUS).  In all honesty, though, I liked the sweet potato fries better than the onion rings.  Anyway, I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with a side of cole slaw, the onion rings, and a vanilla shake while my friends ordered burgers and sweet potato fries.  Everything was DELISH!  The price was also perfect, and the people were totally friendly.

What makes JFG great in addition to everything else is their attention to detail like their focus on local ingredients.  I'm a big fan of supporting local agriculture (including fruits, veggies, and meats), so it's great that JFG supports it, too, to the extent that they can.  I noticed that at the bottom of the menu, it said: Spring 2010, so I'm assuming that the menu changes seasonally based on the farm goods available.  JFG also tries to not use prepared foods much, so they create their own sauces and bread their own onion rings.  Joe's Farm Grill is everything that other restaurants should strive to become, and I HIGHLY recommend you go.  They also have what appears to be a killer breakfast menu, so I might have to try that out in the NEAR future.

Note: If you notice that no condiments or drinks were given to you on your tray or filled in your cup, don't do what my friends and I did and stand there looking for them.  You have to walk out the door."
6ByEVNwpXqh-e9lNQ_X47w,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,4,"The Grand Lux is my FAVE restaurant in Chicago, so when I found out there was one in Scottsdale, and my friend wanted to go there for her birthday, I was totally there.  We waited about five minutes to be seated, and once we were, we were promptly greeted by our waiter (whose name i unfortunately do not recall) who was sooo attentive and full of info.  Our waters were continually filled, and when we asked for more bread, he was sure to keep 'em comin'!  The menu here is huge, so if you're indecisive like I am, I'd recommend taking a look online before you come because you'll sit there forever trying to decide what to order.  I asked our waiter for his top three, and he was more than happy to provide: Miso salmon, Moroccan steak, and spicy buffalo sandwich.  Even though they were heavy contenders, I ultimately decided to go with the Devil's Chicken, which was SO good!  Even though I was full, I continued to eat and kept my membership in the Clean Plate Club.  Then, my friend and I shared a strawberry shortcake, which I HIGHLY recommend.  Our waiter brought out the dessert with a candle on it and made sure to hide it from the birthday girl so she wouldn't see it right away.  Talk about attentive.

Note:  Although the prices here might seem a bit steep, know that your portions are really generous, so it's worth it.  Also take note that if you go in here expecting it to look anything like the one in Chicago, you will be disappointed.  It's not as spacious or as GRAND, but the food and service is still great.  Go."
teTQU7TIPE0O_B1zN_239w,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,4,"Weekly brunch #4 brought my friend and me to Mimi's Cafe today.  First off, let me say it is SO cute!  It's got this French sort of theme going on, and upon walking in, you feel a little Euro flair.  It was kind of strange because there wasn't really a hostess, so people were just kind of milling around the entryway, but someone would occasionally come by and seat people, so there wasn't really a wait.  The food options are really great here, and they have a seasonal menu from which I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I recommend.  They come topped with caramelized cinnamon apples.  My friend got the blueberry stuffed French toast, which is French toast stuffed with blueberry cream cheese and topped with some other fruit stuff, and he said it was really good, too.  Per tradition, my friend also ordered a side of potatoes, and what we liked about these potatoes was that they weren't hashed.  They were diced red potatoes, and they were seasoned so that you didn't even need any ketchup.  They were soft where they needed to be and crispy in just the right places.  We ranked the potatoes in the top two on the list of Best Brunch Potatoes.

What's nice about Mimi's Cafe:
1. Jamie, our waitress, was super friendly and super speedy at coming around to top off our coffees (sidenote: the coffee, depending on what batch you get, might be a bit watered down).
2. If you get the breakfast (with a side of eggs and either bacon or sausage) and don't go a la carte, you also get a glass of juice with the meal as part of the breakfast.
3. The ambience is really cute and comfortable and family-friendly.  It's a place I would like to take my older parents when they come to visit.
4. Prices are great especially if you decide to go with the full breakfast option.

There WAS a little mix up at the end with my credit card not being returned to me when I paid, but when I brought it up to the restaurant people, they quickly apologized and was able to find it and return it to me.  People make mistakes, so I won't count the incident against them.  Also something to note: I'm not sure how crowded they get during peak hours, but my friend and I went around 10:30, which was a great time to go.  The restaurant itself wasn't totally packed, even though the parking lot would make you think otherwise.  That parking lot was kind of small, but it's not a deal-breaker, especially cuz there's a ton of parking across the street on the mall side if you're willing to walk (I, apparently, was not)."
ng8vj7q4kFt7d4Ud4lBhHQ,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,2,"I didn't really LOVE my experience here, but for those who enjoy creative and fusioned sushi or a good sushi happy hour, this is a great place to go.  The menu is pretty impressive with all sorts of sushi concoctions that I have never seen, but I like my sushi pretty standard and not too crazy, so I ordered (ironically) the Crazy Horse roll, which is tuna, yellowtail, and salmon rolled with avocado and topped with tobiko.  I don't have TOO much to complain about regarding the size of the rolls (they were decent) or the taste (it was ok considering this is tempe, arizona), but I think I was most turned off by the service and prices of the restaurant.

When my friends and I walked in, happy hour was happening, so it's understandable that the wait staff were busy, but come on.  Seat us already.  Or at least acknowledge us.  When we were finally seated, our waitress kept huffing and puffing while taking our order.  I understand she may have been having a bad day or have been stressed, but whatever.  Stay profesh.  Then, one of my friends orders the tempura mix, and when it came out, it was missing the prawns, so what happens?  The waitress brings out a single fried prawn on a plate...15 minutes later.  Um...no.  The age-dofu was also kind of meh.  On top of that, I was confused about who was actually serving our table because the girl wait staff kept tag-teaming our table with the guy wait staff, and even then, the service was not awesome.  The whole experience altogether just kind of totaled a bit too much for a sort of blah experience, so I'm pretty sure I'll be going elsewhere for sushi around these parts."
7pGWy3mR7gjMSE6x2njqPA,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"Not the best brunch place in the valley, but certainly not the worst.  Trying to resume my weekly brunch goal, I decided to go to Orange Table today on the referral of you Yelpers.  I was immediately taken by the vibe of this place when I walked in.  There was local art on the walls for sale, the waiters were all real chill, and patrons' dogs were taken care of with their own little water bowls.

After waiting no more than 15 minutes, my friend and I were seated at the bar.  I ordered the white flannel ($10), which is corn beef and hash with onions and mushrooms topped with sour cream.  It came with a side of eggs and toast (i recommend the sour dough).  My friend ordered a red pepper omelet ($9), which she said was good but a bit overload on the red peppers and not consistent throughout (there was too much red pepper on one side of the omelet and too much cheese on the other).  The coffees were delish, though.  I have nothing bad to say about the service, either.  The brunch menu is not as big as I would have liked for it to be, but overall, the food was decent, and the price was alright.  I recommend you try it at least once.

Note: This place is confusing to find.  Park in the garage near AZ88 and walk to the back area."
jqAdZf9PJo8lsRskc6T1Sw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,2,"Although the atmosphere here is quaint with its live mariachi band, the guy with the rose bucket coming around, and the dim lighting, the food is just...meh.  I went here on the recommendation of a friend I was with and had brought some out-of-town guests here for dinner one night, and I kind of wish I hadn't.  First off, I walk in, and the hostess asks how many people are in my party, so I tell her four, and she says to hold on and leaves.  I thought maybe she was getting menus or whatever, but no.  I'm waiting and waiting, and then, I look over and see her standing at a different hostess desk.  Um...hello.  I thought you were getting me a table.  I'm not really sure what her purpose was cuz the entrance was getting full, and she just stood there.  Finally, an older manager-ish man came out, saw the people, and got another girl to start seating people.

Once seated, I started to peruse the menu.  There was some Los Olivos special on there, and I was really confused by it because it was really a sour cream-filled enchilada with some cheese on top for $11.  Really?  I could make that myself for roughly $4.  I ended up getting a combination of 1 chicken and 1 beef enchilada, but I couldn't really tell the difference when it came out since it was all kind of hidden under a ton of melted cheese.  When a stranger at the next table asked what was good here, one of my out-of-town guests was like, It doesn't really matter what you get if you get a special because it all kind of comes as one mess on a plate.  That might sound enticing to some of you out there, but I promise you, it's not messy in an awesome way.  It all had the same texture and taste, and I wasn't even sure what that texture and taste was really.  It was kind of awkward, actually.  Afterward, my friend who suggested the place was like, I swear it was better last time I came, but for some reason, it wasn't good today.  He even went so far to say that if he were a Yelp!er, he'd have given the place three stars.  I, however, am giving it two because, really, I've had much better Mexican food around these parts with better parking, better chips and dip, and better everything.  Kind of disappointed in you, Los Olivos.

PS: If you do decide to go here and try it out, know that they DO NOT split checks."
nL1FdcNZ6liuQ1odNNWVNQ,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"I read about Top Shelf here on Yelp!, so I decided to give it a try in lieu of my weekly brunch with a friend.  We went early, around 5pm and requested to sit outside since it was such a nice evening.  (NOTE: Sitting outside = inhaling smoke from all the smokers coming outside, so be forewarned.)  We enjoyed the chips and salsa they brought out before our meal, and they were quick to refill the chips when we went through them.  I ordered the fish tacos, which came in three and in flour tortillas with a side of jalapenos and pico de gallo and rice and beans.  They were good and greasy and really filling.  My friend ordered the pollo grande, which was so big, he couldn't finish it.  He said they were good, but they were just meh.

The cons: the prices were a little high for a Mexican restaurant, and the ambience was sort of bleh, but...

The pros: the food is decent enough, the employees are friendly, and it does the job of fulfilling your Mexican food craving.  It's just not anywhere I'm rushing to get back to.

PS: If you go in a group, know that they're cool about splitting a bill."
uwDyxK92ae5kNjeZE8uCgA,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,4,"I entered the CPK world late in life, and I'm sad about it because, apparently, I've been missing out.  CPK is great!  Contrary to what I thought, it's not just a place for pizza.  Although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds, I would recommend going JUST for the pizza.  I went this evening for the second time in two weeks and ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad.  It maybe could've used a little more dressing, but it was still good, so I can't complain too much.  When I went last week, I ordered one pizza from the MANY great options available, and I have to say, there is a reason it is called the California PIZZA Kitchen and not the California SALAD or PASTA Kitchen.  So 'Yay!  I'm a fan.' of the PIZZA here.  The other stuff....meh.

The servers are always pleasant here, and I never wait a long time for the food to come out.  Prices are what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  Parking isn't usually a problem unless there's an event going on at Tempe Marketplace.  The up-side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after you're done eating.

Be forewarned: If you are ever asked if you want avocado with your salad, and you say yes, you WILL be charged extra.  Look out for this sneak attack."
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,5,"Best...hashed...browns...ever.  (and yes, it's hashED browns, folks.)  I have tried a new brunch place almost on a weekly basis since I moved here in August, and MBB wins the hashed browns contest hands down.  They're so perfectly and proportionately crispy and soft.  DELISH!  Do try!

I ordered the hog and chick kind of out of necessity since there wasn't a great variety of choices on the menu, but in the end, it didn't matter cuz it was delicious.  I think the thing about MBB is that everything on the small menu is probably awesome, which is why they can afford to keep the menu small.  A nice touch was that they carried the Sunday newspaper, which was perfect since we forgot ours that particular weekend, and that helped to pass the waiting time for our food (which was not bad at all.  maybe 15 minutes.).

For all you coffee lovers, the java here is pretty good as well.  In fact, the waitress told us that the owners of MBB just recently opened up a coffee shop somewhere locally, so I'll have to find out where and go.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long as I did to get into MBB to get some coffee.  Truthfully, it wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we only waited about a half hour.  The only downside to MBB is the small space!  You'd think they would want to expand a little, but mayhaps this is part of the allure for us MBB fans.  No pain, no gain.

Sidenote: Parking is not the BEST, but if you go early, you should be able to find a spot just fine.  ALSO, note that they do NOT split checks.  Good to know beforehand."
x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"This place is A-OK.  Why?  Primarily cuz of the price.  I went here for dinner today, and Pasand has FABULOUS specials.  There are four to choose from, and they are all $4.99.  No joke.  I ordered the chicken curry special (you can choose from all different kinds of chicken curry, so i went with saag), which comes with rice and also your choice of naan or bhatura.  It had a little kick to it, but it was still good.  Even without the specials, the prices are awesome.  My friend got the first-timer special, which comes with a little bit of everything, and it was only $12.

My friend and I also both ordered samosas, and though they weren't the best I've had, they were still pretty good and definitely filling.  Also, per usual when I go to an Indian restaurant, I ordered the mango lassi, and that was delicious.  Not as creamy as I once preferred it, but I think I might enjoy the not-so-creamy version now.

The only downer was that the waitstaff never came around to asking how we were doing or refilling our glasses or coming around with a check.  They seemed not so enthused that we were there, so there was a slight feeling of unwelcome-ness, but neither my friend nor I was all THAT concerned.  I thought it was also interesting that there were some boys (possibly owner's children?) playing with a ball and running around on the other side of the restaurant.  I mean, I'm aware that Indian culture is all about the family, so part of me was like, Whatever.  Then again, there was another part of me that was like, Oh that's distracting.

Regardless, I'll probably go back again when I'm low on cash and need an Indian food quick-fix.

PS: This place also serves some North Indian food.  Yum..."
-FLnsWAa4AGEW4NgE8Fqew,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,4,"On my second official weekly brunch with my friend, we decided to hit The Breakfast Club up, and I really liked this place for Sunday brunch.  We had to wait for a little while, but it wasn't any more than I would expect to wait for a popular brunch spot.  We had the option to sit in or outside, and though we said the fastest seat was ok, we were secretly hoping to sit inside.  Lucky for us, our wish was granted and was seated inside.

My friend ordered the cinnamon challah french toast, which looked AMAZING.  It came topped with candied nuts, seasonal berries, and Vermont maple syrup.  I ordered the BC burro, which was egg, ham, cheese, and green pepper wrapped in a tortilla with a side of hashed browns.  Let me just tell you, BC knows how to do their hashed browns right!  Perfectly browned but not burnt.  The burro was pretty darn good, too, and came with a side of salsa, but I personally liked it better topped with ketchup.  Let me also state here that the burro was totally cheap: about five bucks.  The french toast was not as cheap, but it also was not any more expensive than other brunch places.  The coffee we ordered was awesome because it came hot and strong, which is perfect for a lazy Sunday morning, and the waitress was quick to come around with refills, too.

The reason I'm not giving this place a perfect five is for two reasons.  The first is that the waitress came back with a side of bacon for my friend, which he did not order.  It wasn't a big deal, but he doesn't eat meat, so it was gross for him, and he had ordered hashed browns, so technically, the order came out wrong.  The bigger issue was that about 80% of the way through eating his huge portion of french toast, my friend discovered a hair in it.  Lucky for the staff, my friend is not grossed out by hair found in food and just removed it, then continued to finish his meal with the idea that if he HAD eaten it, it'd have been considered more protein, but for normal people, finding a piece of hair in food is a deal-breaker, so I thought I'd mention it.  My food was fine, though, and it was good, so you go and make your own judgment call.  Oh, and I might also forewarn any of you who decide to go here that the parking situation is kind of crappy.  Just so you know."
a8cpW0oQhnJxvBN2IT-znQ,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"I stopped in here with my friends after dinner one night, and I have to say, I enjoyed it enough.  Obviously, we didn't have any food or anything, but it looked good from what I could see.  They have a great patio, and even though it was a bit chilly, they had warmers out, so it wasn't a problem.  Our waitress was really friendly and bubbly and was quick to serve us and return to us often.  I'm not much of a drinker, so I just got a Sprite, and unlike some other waitresses I've come across who look kind of annoyed with a Sprite order, she was totally fine with it.  In fact, she didn't even put it on the bill!  The vibe of the place reminded me of some bars in Chicago, which was reminiscent of home, so that was nice.

The cons?  Parking sucks.  We just got lucky with a parking spot right in front of the bar, but otherwise...disaster.  Though there are a few people from different groups here, the majority girls are kind of uppity, plastic surgery-looking types, and the guys are looking to pick those types of girls up.  This is a good place to go with a group of friends if you're not looking to meet other people.  Otherwise, I might start here and go somewhere else."
8GRlTN7cdWR5mz38HySZzw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"Another new brunch place to cross off the list.  I took my best friend who was visiting from Chicago to Cafe Carumba one Sunday before climbing the treacherous Camelback Mountain, and we enjoyed ourselves.  The portions were just right, the prices were expected, and the service was nice and friendly.  No hashed browns on the menu, though, which was a little downer since they are a staple order item at weekly brunches.  I'm not sure what else to write.  It was not bad, not great.  It was good enough, and I could probably see myself returning there again at some point.

If you DO go, check out the pictures in the bathroom.  They are hilarious."
hq17ShjPKHnGn5DGnHrsXw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,3,"This week, my friend and I decided to check out this place for our weekly brunch.  It was ok.  Not awesome, but not bad, either.  My friend had the patented (yes, PATENTED) protein pancakes, and they were HUGE.  Some other people were passing our table to get seated and literally stopped to comment on the size of the pancakes.  Anyway, they've got blueberries, granola, cinnamon, and slivered almonds mixed into the batter, so it's quite the pancake.  I tried some and thought they were pretty good, but, like I said, not AWESOME.

I was feeling like a skillet that day, so I got the ham, sausage, and mushroom skillet with two eggs sunny-side up.  The potatoes came out a little bit on the hard side (as did my friend's side of potatoes he got), but it wasn't bad enough where I would be like, This is totally not edible.  On the plus side, the potatoes are Idaho potatoes, so they tasted yummy.  They would've been yummier, though, if they were fully cooked.

Price-wise, this place is probably a dollar too expensive given that the food isn't AWESOME and given that I've been to other brunch places where it's cheaper.  Waitresses know what they're doing, though, and the wait time to be seated wasn't bad at all.  15 minutes tops.  We had to park a little ways from the restaurant, but it was brunch, and the place is in a strip mall with other businesses, so it was expected.  Overall, my friend and I decided it was A-OK."
KYb1uDE-knfgYf_u7mofaA,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,5,"If you're from the Chicago area, you'll be glad to finally see a Sonic and not just see the commercial for it!  I just HAD to go when I moved here, and it's so worth it.  I haven't tried any food, but the slushes are the best because they're so fresh AND refreshing.  They put whole chunks of fruit in them (what fast food place does that?), and if you go between 2-4PM any day, the drinks are all half off.  Drive-thru and drink up!"
yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,2,"I'm not sure if I was expecting too much and got caught up in all the hype surrounding this place, but I have to say...meh.  I've experienced better.  The taste of the food wasn't anything that left me saying, I MUST return here!  I can't even remember what kind of curry I ordered, but it didn't come with rice, so there was an extra charge.  Bummer.  My friends ordered dhaba thalis, which is kind of a sampler dish, and I'll give credit to The Dhaba for loading the food on there.  Perhaps that's the way to go here.

The service was also not impressive.  It wasn't bad, but it was just...slow?  The girl who was our waitress kept coming back to our table without food to tell us the status of our food and that it was going to be delayed.  I suppose that's a courteous gesture, but at some point, I got to thinking, Just come back when you have food.

Though I'm giving The Dhaba only 2 stars, I give their mango lassi and their decor 3 stars.  Check it out.  Overall, I found this place decent enough, but I've had better."
luI3vBj9ciPBWT2bQ7dXXg,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,2,"I was excited to try Smashburger today for the first time after a meeting, but I have to say...I've experienced better.

The menu is decent with enough variety to choose from to keep people coming back (you can choose to have a 1/3 lb, 1/2 lb, or chicken burger for a kind of 'burger'), but there are better burger places to make this place someplace I'd want to keep returning.

First off, there are no combo meals.  You have to get everything a la carte, but if you buy a side with a burger, you get $1 off the side.  Still, I got a 1/3 lb mushroom burger with veggie frites, and I paid about $10.  No drink included.  At a place that is technically fast-food.  And THAT was supposed to be a deal.

Second, the veggie frites were kind of soggy.  There was no crispity crunchy outing that I would have expected from fried veggies.  And they were a bit salty.  And Smashburger was kind of stingy about how much they gave me.  The dip they gave me for the frites were good, though.  I dipped the burger in it, too.

I mean, the employees are friendly, the food is made to order so it's fresh, you have the freedom to basically make your own burger, and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good, which is all great, but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible, better overall value can be found someplace else."
Rj3wnYT1QAxpJlRT5mMc-g,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,5,"My friend and I officially started our weekly brunch get-togethers, and the first stop was this cute cafe.  We didn't have to wait as long as I thought we would, so that was nice.  I ended up ordering a half order of biscuits and gravy with sausage links and two eggs.  Yum!  The portions are plenty big, but I ended up clearing my plate.  My friend got the hashed browns with blueberry pancakes, and I loved that when his order came, they added a mini pancake so as not to waste any batter.  How very opposite of wasteful!  He said his food was delicious as well.  The prices are not what you would expect, so no unpleasant surprises.  The waitress was good too and came back plenty of times to fill our coffees and water and ask how we were doing.

A few things to point out:
1. Be sure to look up once you get inside to see what the special is.  It's usually written above the bar area.
2. If you go looking for skillets (like i did), you will not find any here.  Don't be deterred, though.  The menu carries a good variety, and the food is awesome.
3. They do not do separate checks, so be sure to figure out your payment beforehand if you think you're gonna split a check between some friends.
4. A half order of biscuits and gravy is a lot if you have a normal-sized stomach, especially cuz their biscuits are rectangular in shape instead of round, so be forewarned.

Overall, great service, great food, great place.  Bon appetit!"
tcT3oHh_dwi_FYhozw3Ibw,77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg,2,"To be fair, let me start off by saying that this place has good food.  The reason it's getting two stars is cuz of the service.

My friends and I went here last nite partly to eat and partly to hear The Samba Project perform.  Well, we get there, it's crowded, there's a line, and I hear the couple in front of us ask the hostess how long the wait will be.  Well, instead of just giving the couple a number, the hostess was all, Well, we just sat, like, a TON of people, so I don't know.  I mean, there's one group that's been here for three hours, so you know....   Um...what?  I found that response unprofessional and unnecessary, so I was a little turned off right then.  By the time we get to the hostess, she gives us the same spiel and has us wait by the bar area (VERY little).  Luckily, the restaurant decided to open up its gates, so there was a LITTLE patio area to hang out at until our table was ready.

So, we're called probably an hour or so later, and we are seated...with no menus except the one we grabbed from the hostess when we went to wait at the bar.  John, our waiter, shows up and was all, Can I get you more drinks?  Um...sure.  But more importantly, can you grab us some more menus and take our food order?  We're hungry!!!  Not so much the case, though.  Instead, he proceeds to try and figure out who is on what tab and what tab needs to be closed at the bar, but really, there were only two tabs going: Mary and Matt's.  So John goes to close the tabs and returns with one receipt, asking, I'm sorry.  What was your name again?  Pat?  No, John.  MATT.  How did you forget in two seconds?  Then, he asks about drinks, and a few of us order iced teas.  John never mentions that they are sweetened and flavored peach, so some of them had to be returned.  Yet, upon taking those drinks away, he never asked about getting us something else to replace the drinks that some of us didn't like.  After finally taking our food order, we had to wait another 45 minutes to get our food: a few paninis with chips on the side and an order of bruschetta.  And we got that only after asking John where our food was.  He never came back to ask about more drinks or to refill waters, and I'm pretty sure that we probably could've walked out of there without having paid, and no one would have noticed.

The food was good, though, thank goodness.  I ordered the Chevito panini (flank steak with cheese, peppers, onions).  The bread was nice and toasted, and the inners really complemented the bread and the chips that came as a side.  The $10 price tag was also really do-able.  Note: You get a surprisingly filling portion of food, so go semi-hungry.

Though I didn't eat any bruschetta, it looked amazing.  You can choose from three different kinds off the menu of eight or nine, and those are also of a pretty big size.

The atmosphere is nice, the food is good, the prices are good.  The service is as if they don't know what to do or are overwhelmed with a lot of customers, the waitstaff don't really wait on you, and also a negative to note: the parking lot is way too small for the place.

I would probably go again for the food and atmosphere, but I'd really have to consider what day and what time cuz the staff is just....in need of help."

Since I eat here so often I wish that they would  issue stamp cards so I can get a free sandwich...  = )  (hint, hint)  Oh well I'm sure I'll  be back... I always get the #9, its soo good. They make the sandwiches so fast and I heard that they deliver."
8xIWCN6PlW8E897gFgyFeg,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,2,I wish they use fresh mushroom instead of can. We ordered half cheese and half monster but  the monster was loaded up and it made the bottom of the pizza soggy. Then the other pizza was sausage and mushroom (can) and pepperoni. That pizza was good but would have have be awesome with fresh mushrooms. I like the crust on the pizza it was crispy.  The guys at counter was nice and we didn't have any problems  like other yelpers.

The kids meal was pretty good it came with a capri sun and chicken/rice teriyaki sauce,  edamame oranges and a yakatori.   Our noodle soup came out piping hot and there was enough pork and cabbage.  Now the interior is not up to date its  a ""mom and pop"" interior and no ac was on.  The service was OK.. I thought it was a little pricey.  I would go back to try the other ramen that they had and like other reviews I would try the combo for $2.00 more."

The overall bill for 3 burgers 1 kids meal and 3 sodas was $45, that's a lot dough for me. Then I got to thinking damn I should have taken my kids to In and Out and still had 20 bucks left over. For me the value to what I ate wasn't there. But I have to say the server we got was great. Just not for me."

I also checked on Yelp to get free guacamole which was cool but it was kinda bland, no flavor.  I got the carne adovada which came with beans and rice. Only the rice was flavorful. My yobo had the double stack chicken enchiladas (red sauce) with  the fried egg. His was good but the beans got no taste to them.  The most important  question is......Would I come back??? NO thanks I'll pass"

First of all they don't have fountain drinks so  our drinks were from a can or plastic bottle. We  got the spicy pork (lunch) for $9.99, it was bland, lettuce wrap $5.99 but didn't get the chilli peppers, and 2 spicy tuna rolls. At first our waitress only put in for 1 order so we had to wait. The rolls were big and fat for $4.50 and worth the price. I love it when the tuna is still cold and the rice is slightly warm. That's the only thing that save Gogi from 1 star.  The spicy tuna was the BEST thing here.  I would ONLY come back for that."

Don't be quick to judge the outside of restaurant but head inside. When you walk in you will get a whiff of something delicious cooking in the back.  We ordered Thai tea and Jasmine ice tea which was ok. Then we got the egg rolls and shrimp rolls which was also good. Then of course Pho for 2. We both thought the Pho was pretty good and the broth was little on the sweet side but still delish.  Now after seeing all the picture of the macaroons I had to save room for them. I tried the taro with ice cream and plain and it was too sweet for me.  The service was great. Well if I'm in this part of town I will definitely be here eating again.

I got the yellow curry with chicken # 3 with the spice level 7. And the curry was spicy and sweet at the same time. I loved it.  The egg roll was veggie ( just ok for me) but my Jazzy liked it.   I would defiantly go back for MORE...  Can't go wrong for $6.95 for lunch and its actually filling and Good !!!!"
_IZyyv0dFfpIy_rI_-nwTQ,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,2,"Ok let me explain why I give this place 2 stars. Where do I start...... We sat at the bar and and the bartender was good came to get our drink order right away.  Now we didn't realize that the other bartender which looks and acts like a teenager was trying to get out of the dog house from his girlfriend because the whole time we were there he was trying to please her. It was annoying and distracting from my dinner. Now enough talking about the staff lets get to the good stuff or the lack of. We started with the tempura combo which was ok. It only had 2 shrimp and 4 pieces of random vegetable for $5. Then the sushi. We got the spicy tuna nigiri which look really weird, it looked like it had red food coloring and was really unappealing. Then the tuna nigiri and it needed the red food coloring because it was brown and looked old. Worried about getting sick I passed on that. We ordered another beer and there was no cold glass so I liked that ""good"" bartender actually got a glass iced it down and gave it to us. That is why I gave a extra star.  Now I had to laugh when I was paying my bill the ""kid"" asked if I wanted change from a $51tab when paying with a $100. Now I still left a good tip cause the other bartender actually was working. Would I go back?   Hmmmmm no thanks I've eaten way better sushi somewhere else."
24YIAXzArY1w2GXzoUbcmw,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,3,"I was surprised when I walked in here, it was clean looking.  Tried a late lunch before heading out of town. I read so much about the pot stickers that I had to try them.  They were $4.99 for 8 pieces. (thumbs up).  They were actually good. I was in the mood for noodles so I had the chicken Lo Mein and my other half had the orange chicken and a diet soda.  Oh yea have the Thai Ice tea (its awesome).  The orange chicken was good it was crunchy and the breading was thin so you can tell that you were eating chicken.  Now my Lo mein was ok, not much flavor and it seem like they use spaghetti noodles... as we were waiting I saw that other tables were ordering their pot stickers so its popular there. The service is really good. Most of the menu items are priced at $4.99 which lets you experiment and try dishes because its not gonna cost you an arm or leg."
m1LOUjVzAAoCS61BTL5i5g,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,4,"What can I say about Hodori, I love it, I'm annoyed, then I love it. I been coming here for a long time and it's time for a review.  Everyone knows that the service is not the BEST BUT the yummy food is what keeps me coming back. I even stop coming for a while because the service irritated me so much but here I am back. I have notice the service is so much better. You gotta know that this place is BUSY.....and that there are usually 2 or 3 servers for the whole restaurant so make sure your not in a rush or you will not enjoy your food. We usually get the tofu soup (spicy w/ egg) and lunch special spicy pork, lettuce wraps and go to town. My first bite makes me do a butt chair dance cause it's that good. So find out what makes you dance. ; ) Happy dancing !!!!"
mJJ8TSciSt-UXWsq6tfEXg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,I love this place! It is my favorite gyro place and their salad is perfect. I come here at least twice a month. I crave their delicious gyro!!
9NaZIhfRPkxRJn1eA9zrTA,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,Presentation was really good and give you a lot of food. I got the pastrami which was really good. My wife ordered the bison burger and they recommended that she get it medium-rare; so she did. They brought her burger out well-done... Made no sense! They were really friendly but super slow and under staffed. Probably won't be back.
gRsMPQ8T44cEg2jnvS3omg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,"I really didn't think this place was anything special. Their burgers taste like a Burger King burger. Everything was good, but nothing stood out as amazing or above average. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but if I was in the neighborhood and hungry I might stop by again. For Sun City, this is definitely an amazing place because there is NO good food in that town!"
NzWpIwYwGsjujewhYjPPPg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"For those of you who are looking for something remotely similar to the ""Night Market"" food served in China/Taiwan, this is it! Boba drinks are just like the drinks you find in China; and the snacks (like their fried Chicken) is made the same way! They put the basil leaf and hot powder on their fried food just like they do in China. This is my new snack shack and I am so glad I found it!!!"
Iq7NqQD-sESu3vr9iEGuTA,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"My favorite breakfast joint in Phoenix, hands down!  I don't usually like omelettes but the omelettes here were amazing. Pancakes were awesome, service was great, and the whole family loved it. We will be back many times in the near future!"
-fSW_9x8c_wTm1zS4dz3rw,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"My absolute favorite donut shop! I also am in search of the best Boba drinks and their Taro and Passion Fruit Boba drink is amazing! If you haven't tried one, it is a ""Change your Life"" moment. I go every Friday morning for donuts and the service is excellent."
I6__xsL6K_aGeEJbN4sMJg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,1,Nasty pizza! Don't eat here! I picked it up for take out and when I went to eat it all the toppings including the cheese and sauce slid off! Never had that happen in my whole life! Bring back Di Carlos and go back to Ventura you pizza butcherers!
o4MJ4x8bm3_--37lSkwA8A,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"Very excited for this place! I have only been once and I instantly love it! It has all the delicious Asian food snacks that I have been craving for years! Best service I have had in a long time too! A little nervous about this being right by my house... won't be good for my diet!  I had the BBQ sandwich, boba smoothie, and the Ice Bowl; all were great!"
KyUFj09bfowyddCuOTP4mg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,4,"Tried the #22 Mi Quang (egg noodle soup) and the #34 bun tom bo nurong (rice vermicelli salad bowl). The #34 was the bomb! Fresh and clean tasting, not heavy at all. The #22 just wasn't my thing, not to say it wouldn't be great for someone else. With so much on the menu we will be back to try everything."
yqqXDVl7ZJaiDDbuCFXqMg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,2,"As far as Sun City goes, this place fits in. Not a whole lot of good places to eat. It's ""not bad"" but it definitely isn't somewhere I would eat by choice. Thought I would go simple on my first visit and get the Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was dry. Like really dry. Like I could make it better and I barely know how to cook.
In addition, the restaurant smells. They have carpet and you can just smell all the food and beverages that have been spilled and soaked into the floor. I would recommend driving up to Bell Road and finding something there."
r4HkiC71nB9k8Fe8zIORFQ,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,4,"Their pizza is one of the best fire oven pizzas I have had. It is my kids favorite pizza in town and the two of them ate a whole pizza by themselves! The meatball sandwich was OK, but wouldn't recommend it. Service is excellent and we like the atmosphere. We will be coming back regularly!"
9lH0gzlZB_uXJ1dc9UkF5w,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,2,Crappy BBQ Joint! Used to be one of my favorite places and still is; just not this one. Their chef is horrible. All their meat is dry and disgusting! I live 2 mins away and won't ever come back.
-yQHIYKXH3HAdhh1W52OMQ,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,Best Hot Dog I have had in Phoenix. I like to think of myself as a Hot Dog Connoisseur and I would give this place a perfect score. We had the food truck version and the service and food was great. We will be coming back for more!
-kIscN8I29eXMPkvyyxmRQ,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"Exactly what I expected! Sandwiches were perfect, creative, and fresh. Great atmosphere and service. I would eat here weekly if it was closer! Well done ZOOKZ!"
W607in_una2pkB3lsy6umw,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,"Good size meals, hot fries, good service. Got the Bruwburger and was a little too much for me; a ton of toppings. The green chili was perfect. We will most likely be back."
kPR47uxGqmQNIQkIZr2_Tg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,"Food is absolutely amazing for a breakfast joint. Pancakes are one of the best I have ever had and the portion sizes are enormous! However, I can't get over how dirty this place is! The restroom was as clean as a construction port-a-John. There was food all over the seat, floor, and curtains. My plate had finger prints all over the rim of the plate. The menus are cool because they are like a newspaper, but not cool when it is being reused with someone else grubby had prints and food all over it. Will I be back? Maybe. The food was so good that I want to come back but having a hard time getting over the cleanliness... Maybe in a few months they will have a new manager; fingers crossed..."
BWgXFbRqrPKci7C1__6BXg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"The whole family loved the food. Kids really enjoyed the noodles and teriyaki chicken. I tried the Firecracker Roll and it was delicious. It was small compared to the size of roll you get in So Cal, but the flavors where there and exceeded expectations for a fast food joint. The service was excellent and place was kept clean. We are adding this place to our reoccurring  list of places to eat!"
qdHFUvFhZjvNie3cZiJb9w,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"If you are looking for somewhere nice and on the upper scale, this place is perfect for that special occasion. I don't really do a lot of fine dining, and my only real comparison is Flemings. I would go here over Flemings any day. Service was great and there was nothing wrong with any of the food. Hot, fresh, and fast. Of course it is pricey so we won't be eating here often, but when I want to celebrate I will be coming here!"
TxvTNCvCx8mn1E4DCojErQ,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,2,"This place has finally given up!  Last time I visited the floor was filthy; not just with peanut shells, but trash!  The ketchup dispensers were dirty and empty, all the tables were dirty. My kids ordered hot dogs and they told us five minutes after ordering that they don't have hotdogs. But they would replace it with a grill cheese... another place goes into to the ""We don't give a crap about our customers"" category. Farewell Five Guys if Goodyear!"
LsgE9TBlyvGFF2n7esSd2w,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,1,"I love Pei Wei... But not this Pei Wei! Not only the worst Pei Wei I've been too, but one of the worst restaurants I've been to in my life. I even went three different times to make sure I had to write this place off. First time, they brought out our lettuce wraps and the meat was so burnt you could smell it before they put the plate down. Second time the wonton soup was cold and the dumplings had fallen apart because they had sat for so long... Third time was the worst! Was taking my second bite into the lettuce wrap and there was a half squished bug on the lettuce and it was still squirming! I just put my food down and walked out; never to return. I will go to Panda Express before going to Pei Wei! DO NOT GO HERE!"
aXRrMXXoAN7lawHICgmsxw,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,I liked the creativity but the burger with the English muffin just didn't do it for me. I guess that's the reason why this is the only place I have been to that serves burgers on muffins. If your looking for something different and want to explore than come try this place; but I probably won't be back on my own effort.
8Vpfy_WtcVvZS8Wfz7JQJA,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,"I ordered the crawfish sandwich and a side of coleslaw. Sandwich was great, slightly dry. The coleslaw was not my favorite. I like coleslaw that is crunchy and theirs is pretty soggy and flavorless. I really didn't like the atmosphere; really cheesy and a little uncomfortable. Just not a place I think of going back to."
cIRZU99i82ReJxCqhgXc5g,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,"I thought the tater tots were the best I have ever had. The hot dogs were very good and the service was great. I give my rating based on how likely I would go back and if I would make the 30 min drive again; the answer would be ""no"". Though all those things were good, the atmosphere was poor and the cleanliness was mediocre. There was no hiding that the previous business was a Quiznos and there was no effort to make it their own. The sings were just pulled off and the tape residue was still present... The bathrooms were disgusting and my theory has always been; if they are comfortable with the bathrooms being dirty they are comfortable with other things being dirty."
Q-omXDU8qadIqEvftzu-tA,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"Always a great experience. It a shame they are considered ""fast food"" because they are 1,000 times better than the competition!"
yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,3,"The food was good and the service was great; but there was nothing about it that I would really come back for. It is a way from where I live and the fact is I wouldn't go out of my way again to eat there. It's like Chili's or some other chain restaurant. Everything is good but nothing is ""Out of this world"". We had the green chili stew and pot pie. The stew was not very flavorful and was disappointing given the hype from the waiter and the posts on Yelp. If your in the area, try this place. If not, save your time and go to another restaurant."
yBHNlSLfAd7uXFqlyr01Vg,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"Currently my favorite build-your-own pizza place. The crust is delicious and better than the others. I really like the different suggested pizzas; very creative. Their atmosphere is nice and plenty of room to sit. They go the extra effort by serving your pizza on an actual plate and they have several extra plates already positioned at each table for the convenience of sharing. Their beverage station is nice and has more than just soft drinks; especially great for the non-soda drinkers.

Is this the best pizza I have ever had? No. But for the category of price and fast-food; I don't see how they could do better. For that reason I am giving them a 5 Star Rating."
C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"This is one of my top 5 restaurants! We found this place in Maui and craved it for years! When we saw this place while driving thru Scottsdale my stomach jumped for joy! My wife and I drive 45 mins at least once a month just to go eat here. The fish tacos, fish sandwich/burger, and coconut shrimp & chips are too good to be true! No other place compares!!"
nFVqjh-JCOuV2Uci1ZfJ_Q,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"Nothing to complain about. Great food, great price, quick ordering and delivery; all good! I ordered the ""mini"" BBQ chicken plate and it was the perfect size for lunch. Comes with a good variety of food and the quality of food for a ""fast food"" like chain is top notch. If I am ever craving some teriyaki chicken or island food, I'll be back."
T-KniGykrZ46ZC9plOTspw,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,I have only been here once and had high expectations because of the reviews. I had a green chili pork burrito and it was everything I hoped it would be! The tortilla was AWESOME! Anytime I am around this place I will make plans to come back!
ijIgdh2bRkBNJa_puVpBoQ,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,2,"I love Kneaders, just not this one. Kneaders should fire the owner of this franchise immediately and save their good name. I was so excited when I saw that they were going to build this place!  We don't go anymore because we are tired of battling the staff to get all our order ( they forget something EVERY time). When the food is done right, it is Awesome! But, it's hit and miss..."
GhrZxpoetry_48cvS34Nlw,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,1,"This place is awful!!! It isn't Di Carlos anymore. It is ""Di Worst"" pizza ever! I tried it just to give it a shot and threw it away it was so gross! DO NOT EAT HERE!"
4dCOilGYflzGzizOPKyvow,JWZUc88CHiquQX0MbY2vXg,5,"I had the short ribs at Grassroots about a year ago. It was the first time I had ever tried them. I have been ordering short ribs at other restaurants ( like Flemings) and they don't even come close! Grassroots has ruined me and I will only order short ribs here! Tender, delicious, ribs."
Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"Awesome venue!  We were starving and not sure if they even had food.  Yup, they did.  Best burrito I've ever had!  Not sure if that was my empty stomach talking or what.  The bartenders were super friendly and chill.  I love that they have bathrooms inside the venue, as well as a bar.  Can't wait to see another show."
5Ktv5ZmJI0CN4L0KxDWJvw,PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA,4,"This place is a neighborhood staple. The menu is not my fav (my taste buds only). I sat at the bar waiting for a friend to show up. I think the bartender was new, not just because of the deer in the headlights look on his face, but also the fact that I had to wave him down after about 7 minutes of sitting there. There were 6 specials, 2 which caught my eye. After settling on one, we ordered and were told they were out of 4 of the 6 specials. Might I add it was about 12:15pm. That seemed a little early to be running out of specials. The food we ordered ended up to be OK.

If you haven't eaten here, you must. If given the option I would pick 3.5 stars. This is because of the service and the lack of available specials (maybe cross them off the sandwich board out front when you run out?) I've heard they have a great happy hour and I would definitely recommend the bacon-wrapped shrimp on the app menu."
GlwOGCjSzts7AnbK9gqmng,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,4,"So my husband and I are happy to find another open late option near our home. We had the cheese bites, which I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and non-greasy they were. I had the citrus salmon and he had a chicken mushroom dinner. Overall for the price I don't have too much to complain about. The portion was perfect, my salmon was grilled perfect. No dryness whatsoever in his chicken either. Really the only negative was the baby purée which my husband said was supposed to be his mashed potatoes, and his rice was over done while mine was a bit underdone. All in all, I definitely think this place is a step up from Applebee's and would give it another try. Service was good and attentive which was appreciated since we arrived close to closing time."
D3dAx-QW_uuClz4MambeHA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,2,"After hearing about this place for years, and finally being able to get a parking spot close by, I decided to try it. But low and behold the pizzeria was full so I was directed to a very cluttered and crowded market with the same menu. Besides the uncomfortable claustrophobic atmosphere, it was frustrating finding a spot to wait for my food without being pushed in a corner or up against a display. And sorry, the food was good but those had to be magic avocados for the price I paid for that personal pizza."
dNr7VKRti8dXWE-jzfVBtQ,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,2,"I had heard so many good things about this place from friends, but ended up being disappointed. Today was my first experience. Normally I give a place a few chances before writing a review, but this was ridiculous.
The atmosphere is cool. The beer, at least the one I got to try was great. I would have ordered more if the server was on top of things.
The food was okay. But our service was so horrible. I can normally give the benefit of the doubt if the place was busy, but it was not. My husband and I arrived at 4pm on purpose to avoid the potential dinner crowd.
It took forever for our male server to acknowledge our table. We got our beers and water right away when we were finally able to order. But our appetizers and regular food came out at the exact same time, which tells me he was inexperienced or there is a kitchen problem. He checked in once midway through eating. When my husband asked for the check, the server didn't even bother asking if we would like any more water or needed a box for our leftover food. Once the server finally got around to running the card he just dropped off the check and walked away even though my husband was mid sentence asking for water.
Needless to say I don't think either one of us will be coming back any time soon."
iOt7ebp4Zy-5YUjHL1rbmQ,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,3,"Finally some decent Mexican food out east! Yes gringos, not all tacos are fried in a hard shell.
The service indoors was great. Nice smiley people. Love the simple menu. Fair prices. Tacos and Burritos are tasty. Love the salsa bar with the cucumbers. The drive thru on the other hand, I was not greeted with a smile. I ordered my usual tacos with burrito meal, but was not offered any side of salsa or limes. I honestly felt like I was processed through the pick up window. I get better drive thru service at Taco Bell."
Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,2,"This place gets a two star primarily because the white wine sangria was very tasty. Other than that, was not very impressed at all. I came for a friend's bday dinner the other day. The restaurant was completely empty yet we, a table of 9 had the slowest service possible. And our server kept disappearing. Seriously there may have been two other small tables but that is it. The menu looked impressive but the end food result was very lacking. I don't like paying for an expensive meal that is not good. The $13.00 salad I ordered was tiny and extremely bland. Even the $15 peach appetizer just wasn't good either. The prosciutto did not taste right. I recommend saving your money by not coming here. There are plenty of other options available in the EV that have a similar menu, but are not as pricey and have better service."
IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,4,"I have been coming to this place to fulfill my Persian cravings since I moved to Arizona. It is a bit pricey unless you go for lunch but one thing I can say is that it is worth it. The joojeh kabob (cornish hen) and the bargs (chicken and filet) are always very well marinated, tender, and never dry or tough. Each dish comes with a great helping of hot rice which I also love. The cucmber yogurt dip is a must. Love this place, worth the extra dollar if you want a great Persian treat for yourself."
ohEnmKpF7i2_ujme1p_vUQ,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,5,"Liked the Tempe location but like this one better. I went there for the first time last night and it was refreshing having a more open atmosphere and the choice for outdoor seating. As usual service was awesome, beer was awesome, and food was awesome. I left very contented."
RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,5,"Stayed at the Valley Ho a few days, so I had a chance to experience the Zuzu for all three meals. All of which, from what I ordered, we're amazing and extremely delish. The night coconut cream pie was the featured dessert was my fav. So delicious without being disgustingly sweet. The fries, salads, sandwiches, just everything I tried was good. The BLT and truffle grilled cheese are to die for. Even the side of asparagus was really good. Service was also really good and friendly."
cTZmf7B-4yciMc1WKiCVOA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,5,"I am so glad I decided to take a chance on this little place. Great food at a fair price. And, great service to boot. I had their chicken and cheddar biscuit called the Little Birdy and was in heaven. The chicken was moist with great flavor, not greasy, and not doughy. The biscuit it was on was perfection. Crispy and fluffy where it needed to be with a well balanced butteryness. To make things even better the biscuit did not fall apart after the first bite :). Loved the relaxed atmosphere and music selection outside. The dudes that were working were very courteous and answered questions without eye rolling like you may get at other downtown establishments."
-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA,C_cdjSNzJ70owXGXw_GlQA,2,"Inconsistent is an understatement. The first time my husband and I came here the food was great and the service was very attentive. The only complaint was the ridiculous pricing for the tiny ration of food. This time around the service was extremely slow and lacking which doesn't make sense for a not busy Saturday dinner service at a restaurant. My husband had to get up to ask for a beer. He also then had to get up a second time to get a cold glass for the beer. It also took forever to get our appetizer. The appetizer came out just a handful of minutes before the meal.
Now the first time I ate here the aloo gobi was great. Portion was small, but it was a flavorful assortment of cauliflower and potato and tomato.
This second time around, the aloo gobi was watery, bland, and at the most there were two little bits of potato and hardly any cauliflower. The rest of the mixture was just straight up red onion. Not to forget, there was absolutely no spice. I ordered it medium and got ridiculous bland. I also don't think it helped that the food was served lukewarm.
Not sure the hubby and I will be back after the two extremely different experiences we had."
mm0qwYzOilFNVV2us5_8Rg,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,4,"Great coffee shop featuring:

- tasty espresso - beans roasted on site
- ample parking
- ample seating, indoor and out
- free wifi - password 'titusblend'
- good music, and not so loud it keeps you from concentrating
- friendly staff
- open until 10
- food menu but sandwiches only served until 3 - after that it's pastries, cookies, etc.  (also a pizza place a few doors away.)
- not all tables have access to electric
- no live entertainment that I've seen, though they have held a barista contest and another event featuring Walter, the world's largest VW bus."
EUQoB_ph7_xIyj7JZGI3bg,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,3,"Good food, cozy vibe - but I enjoyed it more back when you could bring your own wine (and before the appearance on Food Network brought bigger crowds.)

Ask the server what he/she recommends that particular day.  They're usually honest and are spot on.  And try going later and see if you can have a chat with the owner.  He used to (maybe still does) play with the Phoenix Symphony and has some great stories."
eq-SNqLqUP5rAc_PZAHuEA,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,2,"I don't know - it just seems like looking at Ra these days is like looking at an aging rock star trying to hang on to better days.

There was a time when I would have given this place 3 or 4 stars but the last few visits have been less than impressive.  Uninspired rolls, at times with stale fish, mediocre service, tired decor.  Maybe it's because there used to be fewer alternatives in the Valley.  Maybe it's because I've been to more really good sushi places since then but something just isn't working for me.

If you're new to sushi or like the more basic rolls (California, anything with 'krab'); if your first consideration is the quality of the happy hour prices; or if you feel it's just not 'in' without heavy house music in the background, by all means give it a shot."
mnwRtuVQEsIUomBchu0gwg,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,5,"The first time I went I wasn't impressed but I've been back multiple times now and it's become one of my favorites in Arcadia.

The Sunday brunch is one of the best deals around - $10 for a meal and either a beer or a mimosa.  The meals are all quite good and the mimosas are strong.  Above average bloodys as well, two great porches (front and back) that are a little too comfortable.  Also dog friendly so if you have a social pooch be sure to take him/her with.

And, of course, the beer selection is top notch, though twice now I've settled on a favorite only to find them replace it in their cycle.  The price of keeping things fresh.  :)"
S-oLPRdhlyL5HAknBKTUcQ,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,5,"If you like sushi do yourself a favor and check this place out.  Comfortable environment, excellent service, and some of the best rolls I've had in PHX.

We stopped in on a Friday night after a friend's recommendation.  He also recommended the Oh My God roll, which we ordered.  The name, though a little goofy, was fitting.  Our friend also recommended that, if given the chance, we chat with the owner, Juno.  It was a slow night so rather than pick from the menu we asked our waiter if it would be possible for Juno to make us three rolls of his choice.  She seemed stunned by the request but asked him and he obliged.  Next came three rolls that weren't on the menu but definitely should be - each excellent.  Juno came over and chatted with us for a while after that and his stories, energy, passion for sushi, and genuine kindness was the perfect ending to the perfect meal.

With restaurants in NYC and Arkansas, Juno next wants to open a second, larger place in Phoenix - possibly Scottsdale or Arcadia - with live entertainment in the way of taiko drums.  Hopefully that will happen soon.  We need more places, and people, like this in town."
K99GG6-YZp5JbIe4oPbRsQ,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,4,"A welcome addition to the Arcadia neighborhood.

As of this writing I've tried the bravas fries, two of their pizzas, one of their pastas and one of their piadinas/flat breads.  All exceeded expectations.

Excellent beer selection and, from what I could tell a solid wine offering as well.  Ask about their Beer Club.

Knowledgeable, friendly and attentive staff in a nice atmosphere and a misting system on their patio that, believe it or not, is strong enough to make 108 not only tolerable but enjoyable.

Reasonably priced - which given the location isn't a given.

I'd like to see this one stay around for a while."

It's a lot like college in that it is what you make of it.  And also like college, the more you go the better your experience will be (see: learning curve).  For instance, those that have been there know it's not really the best place for food.  Typical bar fare with certain dishes (spicy beer cheese, fries) that will stay with you, and not in a good way.

On the other hand, if you eat before you go and are merely looking for a place to kick back and have a beer or three while watching the Dbacks or Cards, or play trivia, then Hazelwoods is an option worth considering.  Cool, comfortable, cold beer."

I'm happy to report that the Pad Thai is very good here - maybe not the best I've had in the Valley but not far from it.  My dining partner reported his dish (Curry Chicken) was delicious too.  And the Thai iced coffee is so damn good they should list it under desserts.

Comfortable vibe, friendly staff, good beer selection, ample parking, reasonable prices, nice patio, and from the photos, a big hit with our local newscasters."

EulFlbKaXT_DXG_xL6-mQQ,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,3,"According to our server, Sushi Brokers is ""a sushi place for people who don't like sushi.""

So is that a good sign or a big, red flag? How you answer is probably a good indication of how much you'll like this place.

The fish is fresh, however purists beware - a lot of it is smoked or cooked, and the vast majority of the rolls include 'krab.'

After taking a seat at the bar it was a waiting game for drinks, refills, our bill, etc. though our chef - Eddie - definitely knew what he was doing.

It's a good atmosphere but, as other reviewers have stated, on the pricey side. Dinner for 2, with 2 bombers, over $100, plus tip.

In the end we were full, but also reminded how much we miss Zen32."

We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were very average.

We also order two entrees, the Moussaka and the Sheftalia Dinner Entrees and very disappointed in both.  The Moussaka was very average with no flavor and the Sheftalia kebabs had some flavor but we very salty.

Overall, I think there are many better choices for Greek food in the valley."

We decided to try this restaurant because we had a localoffer certificate and when we went for lunch it was not accepted because we were told that it is only accepted for dinner (even though the certificate had no mention of it).  We ordered the Moussaka which was freshly made and was jusk ok.  The Chicken Shwarma lacked flavor and was also below par.

So we decided to use our certificate we would go for dinner.  Things just got worse as it seemed like the owner was doing the cooking and also trying to serve as well.  It took nearly half hour to get the appetizer.  The entree, the gyros were supposed to be wonderful, but once again a sore disappointment.  Other partrons were getting impatient and a party of 10+ people just came and then quickly left.

This place needs some serious operational guidance to survive and succeed."
SWhHaWFuijy_KDs0zVCJog,XJeGubH0A7eKMbJvfWDk3A,1,"I have been a fan of RigaTony's for a long time and this reviews was certainly nothing against the food, but about their billing and service.

I was with a friend and given that we had not met for a while, decided to go to a casual yet elegant setting and what better place than Rigatony's.  It was a very quiet night for a Monday and in the end we were really not very hungry and order two appetizers and a dessert.

The server seemed so very anxious and kept coming constantly asking us about if we wanted to order entrees.  I just felt very rushed there and so did my friend.  In a true family style Italian Restaurant and I have been to many including Italy, they thrive on the fact that you take your time to talk and enjoy the moment rather than being rushed like a fast food experience.

The thing that really shocked me is that they charged $8.50 us for the salad, which we never asked for and I always thought came complementary and also a split charge for $3.50 as well, considering we both got appetizers and just decided to share it.   Wow that is some rip off for sure.

I strongly believe that truth in advertising is so important to a business.  It does not matter if they serve the tastiest food, but unscrupulous billing was certainly very shocking.  I sadly left a very generous tip for the server, having been one myself.

Given this experience, I would rather take my business elsewhere."

We ordered a Margarita and Sangria.  Both were very very substandard and cannot see myself ordering mixed drinks in the future.

The food did appear flavorful with the Carne Adovada Quesadilla done perfect, the Carne Adovada House Special both a real hit.  The Aztec Chicken came with a wonderful presentation, but it lacked any depth in flavor.

We went around noon but the line was too long and so thought we would come back closer to the ending time for the deal i.e 3 pm.

We were there at around 2:45 pm and they told us that they were No Longer Honoring  the Deal.

No consideration was given that the customer spent their time and gas to come there with the knowledge that the deal would be honored.  The FULL Page Ad in the Arizona Republic specifically said it was till 3 pm and it did not have any exceptions or restrictions whatsoever.

Every time Fox opens a restaurant we feel like he had me and my wife in mind.  Good food with rich ingredients.  Clean, modern, casual dining experience.  And Sauce is fast and serves up some great salads and pizza.

Personally I like to keep it simple with the Mozzarella & Fontina Cheese & Basil pizza.  I will occasionally ask for tomatoes on top and always top it off with the crushed red peppers.  My wife loves the caesar salad and I can understand why.  Their dressing is brilliantly balanced and add on the fresh cheese flecks and it is simple, but great.  I have had other salads and they are all good and as others have stated, the mac and cheese is very good.

I love Osha.  Why?  They're serving Thai food.  Not Thai-fusion, not ""Yeah, we have a Thai name, but we're really just basic stir fry like the restaurant that closed up at Desert Ridge"",  but Thai.

You want Panang?  They have it.  Mussaman?  They have it.  Green curry?  Yup.  All of the Thai basics are here along with your assortment of meats (and tofu for the wifey).

If you want it hot, you're going to get it hot.  That's why you came, right?

Not quite a ""date night"" style place, but if you're looking for unapologetic, unpretentious Thai cuisine, there's no place that comes even close in Scottsdale.

They have a menu that changes monthly, but if the grilled octopus is available when you go you have to try it.

The prices are a value for the complexity and quality of the food.  If Top of the Rock was in a city like Los Angeles, it would easily be 300% higher.

Excellent, rustic French cuisine -- the type that you can find in a small neighborhood where the French actually eat.   A job well done and now my ""Go To"" place for French food!

Wow, that's some impeccable service right there

The bartender that served us was absolutely indifferent, we probably could have walked in wearing monkey suits and she wouldn't have batted an eye.

It's got a great location, but it just feels like a run-down frat house.  If they got their service together, it might be better but this was certainly my first and last visit there.

There's nothing ""genius"" about this place at all.  Just another below average ""you're lucky we let you in"" bad service Scottsdale bar.

Edit.  The most hilarious part was that the male bartender knocked a cocktail shaker onto the dirty floor below and it sat there for about 15 minutes.  He came back, picked it up and put it next to the sink.

I told my wife ""I bet he's going to use that shaker!""

""No, that's where all of the dirty cups and glasses go.""

Low and behold, he picks up the mixer and mixes a few drinks in it WITHOUT washing it.  Eww!  Come on now man, you can't do stuff like that.

Ordered one carne asada, one chicken and one carnitas.

All three tacos didn't quite have enough onions or cilantro for my tastes but the bartender brought some extra when I asked.

Carne Asada really needed more marinade as it was bland.

Chicken was good, but certainly benefitted from the salsa verde and a couple shakes of salt.

Carnitas, a little over greasy, but flavor was good.

BgTFsq79xmnRkX0gA1za1Q,OPiV-yNPoLf57J1OWUdylA,1,"We figured it was a lovely afternoon to conduct some business on the patio at Twin Peaks in Scottsdale.  Good service by our waitress, passable appetizers but it all came with a shock.  Our waitress, Janell (??) was very helpful but approached our table about an hour later and said they're instituting a cover charge and that she could ""...go ahead an add $15 to our check for a party of three.""

Personally, I was shocked as our tab was already north of $80 (and climbing) and we hadn't even ordered our meal.

I ask to speak to the manager and about ten minutes later he arrives to say that it's ""corporate policy"" and that they always do that when there's an event.  Plus, there was ""now a sign that we can go look at that mentions a $5 cover"", which wasn't at the door at our arrival time.

So it was basically, ""We'll add $15 to your bill or you can leave"".

I talked about how this is  neighborhood bar, our bill was almost $100 already before we even ordered an entree and it wasn't clear that there was a ""special event"" taking place, our hostess mentioned nothing, there was no sign (at the time) and our waitress was just as surprised as we were about the requirement to add an additional $15 to our bill.

I was told that I was free to leave and read the sign that is now in front of the door.

The manager insisted that we pay an additional $15 or vacate.

We decided to wrap up business, leave the bar and went elsewhere for dinner.

The manager decides to end our evening without an opportunity to order an entree, closes our check and makes it clear that our business isn't welcome.

Twin Peaks has a great bar and a great patio during the afternoon, but the indifference of their manager completely turned me off from returning.  Visiting during the afternoon to conduct some business on the deck, never.

This was a piss-poor experience and sadly, the manager doesn't care."

But it seems that the menu went from the classics of Thai cuisine to some strange American-Asian fusion which was trying harder to be ""stir fry with Thai influence"" rather than straight up Thai.

So we stopped going and eventually, through no fault of our own, the restaurant closed.

We went to Malees down on Main in Old Scottsdale and I had very high hopes.

The soup was good, great flavors, all the right ingredients.

However, for the main courses, again, what in the hell is up with the menu?  I kept looking for the Thai classics, but they were really either hidden or nowhere to be found.  Panang, a bit, Mussamon was shockingly absent, but lots of 'fusion-style"" dishes and largely pedestrian fare was abundant.

This is darned near like going to an Indian restaurant and having no aloo mater, tandoori dishes or naan.

If you're looking for a semi-elegant place to bring out of town guests that say they're adventurous eaters but probably aren't, you may find this as an acceptable choice.

If you're a true fan of the Thai classics, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.

The service is good, a little rushed and the owner seems to care about the restaurant, but I really won't be returning until Deidre brings back the Thai classics.

I don't want a simple, universally-accessible menu.

I want to go on a culinary adventure.  Bring back the adventure and I'll bring you my dining dollars."

Ordering is quick, fun and simple through interactive kiosks.  The ramen, hirata buns and gyoza are absolutely amazing.

Food was so squalid that I literally wrote a narrative on the back of the receipt to give to chef about food preparation.

Drinks are OK but terribly overpriced.

Certainly a place to go on a friday night if you're looking to party, but I would HEAVILY suggest against eating here, especially if you like Mexican food.

Terrible food.  Would be considered bland even if you were a Iowan from some small two-horse town and had never had Mexican food before.

Terrible service.  Waited 15 minutes on a slow night for service and had t o walk inside and ask the bartender to sent a waitress out.  And even then, completely indifferent.

Overall impression.   Someone needs a tax writeoff.  It's almost as if ""The Producer's"" Max Bialystock opened a Mexican restaurant:  ""So we can make MORE money if the restaurant fails?  BRILLIANT!"""
B4ZuEVKHnr2blYg-QiGOkw,OPiV-yNPoLf57J1OWUdylA,1,"Terrible.  My wife and I went there early afternoon on Thursday.

First, the counter attendant commits the ultimate faux pas:

""Are you together?""

Well duh, it's 2010.  Two wedding bands, my wife has lineage from Germany and Sweden and me, somewhere in N. Africa, but at least greet me before telling me that my wife of 10 years and I don't look like a couple.

Next, the food was miserable.

I had an ""Orange Peel Beef"" and the dish felt like someone breaded beef jerky, fried it hard and poured a bottle of mystery sauce over it.  All of the chili sauce at Pei Wei's couldn't save the dish.   Any vegetables in the dish had the consistency of something unpacked out of the freezer and dumped right in the deep fat fryer.

Again, I ask myself, why in the world can't we get at least basically edible Chinese in Arizona?

My wife, or colleague as the front counter attendant assumed, ordered some chicken dish.

Again, over-breaded, had the taste and consistency of an order of McDonalds McNuggets drenched in a tub of sweet 'n sour sauce and poured over white rice.

This was literally the first time we went back to our home and dug out leftovers after spending almost $30 on lunch.

Literally, my best experience about our meal at Pei Wei was the drive home.  Three of three strikes, shame on us for giving it another shot.

Pei Wei was awesome about three years ago, but now it's to the level of Paradise Valley Mall food court and that sucks.  This place needs an enormous amount of customer service training and at least a weekend ""food stand-down"" and retraining of the chef's.

I was HEAVILY disappointed.  Again."

1.  EXCELLENT food.  I've never had a meal that was less than absolutely fabulous here.  The Korean side dishes are amazing and the kimchee is amazing.

1.  I live in N. Scottsdale, so it's a little far.

TXjg3qtm6gjlbP8Iwsm4lQ,OPiV-yNPoLf57J1OWUdylA,2,"I like Chipotle, but they've got to make some changes for my tastes.

First, the salsas are lacking.  Can a brother get a salsa selection without red onion?  Red onion smell like Sasquatches cornhole, I cannot STAND those things.  Maybe lean back towards more traditional salsas like tomatillo or perhaps roasted Hatch.  Oftentimes, I'll order a burrito sans salsa and just add my own at home.

Secondly, what the hell is this, Subway Sandwiches at lunchtime?  I know speed is of the essence but haste makes waste, baby!  If you arrive at Chipotle at a busy hour, they're going to make a murderous mess of your burrito.   Split tortillas, tortillas soggy with the liquids from the beans, cross-contaminated filler (ooh!  Look!  It's a chicken-barbacoa fusion!)

Fast casual, I can appreciate.  Food made screamingly fast can really wreck the end product so please, I know you need me at the cash register and out of your way for the next customer, but for the love of Grog, take your time and let's work on ""First Quality"".

5BKP0DY4K79h9sd7THpeBw,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"OK, here's the funny part - Lamp is located about 5 or so storefronts from a Pizza Hut. OK, I found that funny.  On to my review.

This place is pretty awesome. The interior is long, narrow, and dark.  The kitchen, along with the gigantic wood oven, takes up one half of the space with tables taking up the other half.  I've been here a few times and the service has always been excellent.

You'll find a number of starters including soup and salads. I go for the Mignulata (a stuffed bread) which is delicious. They offer a variety of red and white pizzas but you can add ingredients if you have some favorite toppings.  They also have an OK wine list; it's not extensive but you'll no doubt find something you like.

Here's the dilemma. The pizzas are 12 inches cut into 6 slices.  If I have an appetizer there's no way I can finish a 12 inch pizza so the leftovers go home. My experience has been that leftover pizza doesn't taste near as good when reheated. This is especially true for thin crust pizzas - the crust gets overcooked.

Even if I don't have an appetizer, that's a lot of pizza.  My solution is to share an appetizer and a pizza.  As long as neither of you are big eaters this should work for you. If you're still hungry, they have a nice dessert menu or you can stop by the Pizza Hut (j/k)."
0W_pPAiTXgazY2mtX6o0_w,8fU6lsiDxgu4E37aCahIuw,4,"I was in Chicago recently and went to the downtown location for a quick meal. I had the Italian beef and a friend had a hot dog.  I regretted not coming back to try a hot dog but, after learning there was a Portillo's in Scottsdale, I figured I'd get one back home.

And I did.  I went here with the same friend. The restaurant's interior looks a lot like the Portillo's in Chicago except it's smaller and newer. This is one of those, walk up to a counter and place your order and then wait until your number is called along with something clever that rhymes with your number, ""43 come and see me"" (the woman in Chicago was much better, the guy in Scottsdale just didn't have his heart in it). You then sit in their large seating area.

My friend got the Italian beef and I got a jumbo hotdog with everything.  Some comparisons - the Italian beef I got in Chicago was tasty but it was was very wet. I mean, running down your arm when you picked it up wet. The Italian beef here was moist but wasn't dripping.  The hotdog was OK. This was my first Chicago-style dog so maybe I just didn't know what to expect. It's a fat beef hotdog with mustard and there are sliced onions, pickles, peppers, etc just laying in the bun along with the hotdog. It was good, just not what I was used to.  My friend said she preferred the Italian beef over the hotdog she got in Chicago. I concur.

On the plus side - $20 for an Italian beef, a jumbo hotdog, a shared side of onion rings and two soft drinks! Nice deal."

Really good food!

This may be North Scottsdale's best kept secret. Although it seemed a bit odd to have a fish taco at a Hawaiian themed restaurant I figured, why not? I once had McDonalds in Japan and KFC in London - this was much better.

The fish tacos (you get 2 on separate plates) come with a rather small soft taco shell that's piled high with fish, mango, cole slaw, etc.  It's nearly impossible to fold this up and I guarantee some food is going to drop out - don't worry about it, but get a fork.  I also tried the fish and chips (again - in a Hawaiian themed restaurant?) which were also excellent.

At first I thought the prices were a bit high (the fish tacos were $11) but after tasting the food I think they're well worth the price.

FYI - I had a little trouble finding this place. The address is on Scottsdale but it faces Bell just west of the intersection. It's very close to Carlos O'Brien's."

I work nearby and occasionally the only convenient time to meet with someone is first thing in the morning. This is my go-to meet for breakfast spot.  The food is very good, the service is fine and I've never had much trouble finding a table.  They offer a range of items on their menu - from something light to go for it big boy!  I usually get an omelette - light and fluffy and I've tried the Huevos Rancheros (so-so but OK).

I've dropped in here a few times for lunch as well. The wraps are pretty good.

Bottom line - nice place to grab breakfast if you're at or near CityScape.  Don't expect ""WOW, OMG, Best. Breakfast. Ever!"" but you'll walk away happy.  You should also not expect to see the cast of the movie."

We got a sampler platter for a starter the last time we came and it was a lot of food!  It comes with artichoke dip, chicken wings, onion rings, mozzarella, zucchini and mushroom fritti. No problem serving three adults and two kids.

They have a nice menu with a number of choices. But, I figure that any place that has the tag line, ""your neighborhood pasta place"" is giving me a hint about what to order. I've had the Baked Ziti and the Sausage Lasagna. Both dishes are very good.  Their sauce is delicious and they're a contender for the best meatballs in the valley.

The food is good.  They have an extensive menu (sandwiches, salads, tacos, etc.) but the main event for me at this restaurant is the burger. Your choice - beef, turkey or veggie served on a white or whole wheat bun or as a wrap.

The food is OK and much like that food you'll find at Yard House, Gordon Biersch, TGI Fridays, etc. Yes, they have their own ""spin"" but it's really not that much different.

Service has always been friendly. The food shows up quickly and I've never had to wait for a refill.  They really push their BJ's beer but they have a number of other beers on tap (ask for a Bud Light - go on, I dare you!).

There's a fireplace on the patio, and the dining room has wainscoting - it's a very comfortable setting. A place you can relax and enjoy some good food.

I recommend getting a few things from the ""local produce"" section of the menu.  The pecans with arugula and chevre is a personal favorite. I'm a sucker for the their Posole soup with either a chicken salad sandwich or brisket sandwich.  If you're into pork, try the ""pig of the week"" sandwich; ask your server how it was roasted this week (they vary it from week to week).

1. Horchata with all kinds of goodies inside, like pecans and cantaloups and strawberries, I mean these are ""real"" and not those freeze-dried stuff. My poblem with it is it only comes in one size--32 ounces, which is like two meals for me.

2. The salsa bar...never knew there could be so many kinds of salsa! That alone is an adventure in taste-testing. My personal fave is the jicama one, which really is more of a relish but who's checking.

3. Chicken mole and pibil...they do it right. Their mole could be a bit spicier for my taste but that's what the salsas are there for. I had the chicken mole as a taco and the pibil as a burro (separate occasion, alright, don't think I'm a pig now).

It's a great date place, I think. It's small, it's quaint, in a good neighborhood, and the satffers are very friendy.

I love this place so much that I didn't even care about the tiny creature scurrying across the floor near the front door. That's  not their fault though. That was just an unfortunate situation. Not a reflection of them.

So try it."

I'll tell you this much: Lucky Strike does listen to customers and take customer service seriously.

Shortly after this review, I got a nice note from their corporate headquarters apologizing for a not-so-good experience, and that's all I needed. I dig a company who acknowledges that there is always room to better serve their customers. I've been back to Lucky Strike many times (for lunch, for dinner, for a lazy Sunday) since then and there is definite improvement in phone manners and in handling customers' questions.

More importantly, Phoenix management went above and beyond for me on  a busy Friday night. I didn't expect an agreeable response, I simply thought there was no harm in asking, and management surprised me with an excellent solution.

And that excellent solution made a new mom/birthday girl very happy.

Anyway, we have been going to Cyclo since its early days. Coming from the Bay Area, we were a bit disappointed that there were no decent Asian restaurants in the area, until we stumbled upon this restaurant. The flavors of the foods are amazing, really rich and sometimes a bit complex. Try the Hanoi and the shrimp appetizer...yum! And I truly enjoy the refreshing lemonade...a bit on the sweet side, but strangely refreshing! You have to go! Oh, and you can bring your own wine...just make sure it's a good bottle. Justina's going to make a note of it if you bring a cheap one."

There was no mistaking, the ambiance oozed of 85255. The food was not bad. We tried quite a number of tapas selection, and not one would be considered mediocre. In fact the veal, was exceptional. Very moist and tender, the kind that would just melt in your mouth. The calamari was delectable as well. It wasn't covered completely in breading (like some restaurants do to make the pieces look bigger). You can actually see that what you're eating is deep fried squid with enough crust/breading to give it a slight garlicy-taste. The aioli dipping sauce that went with the calamari complimented the dish nicely.

The surprise of my dinner was the brussel sprouts. Now, I normally don't like brussel sprouts, but this particular dish was done right. Steamed and then grilled (it seemed...I don't know, but in between sangria and wine, the different dishes I was tasting were starting to blend together), it had a lemony garlic taste that masked that somewhat bitter aftertaste that I get after ingesting mom's. You have to try it!

The vibe was a bit too ""cold"" for me. Everyone enjoying their own little clique while sipping wine. You know the scene. The sommelier, to me, was the most animated character in that joint (of course, aside from my dining compadres). If you do decide to go, ask for David, the sommelier...he might just offer you a good deal on a very expensive decanter for a fraction of the cost...hmmm...

Worth a try. They take reservations."

I ordered my usual green bean tempura, a healthier alternative to fries. Always perfectly cooked. Spicy salmon and shrimp tempura rolls are great choices for happy hour.

FYI all appetizers are half off for happy hour and Tuesdays are half off wine bottles from 7 pm to close. It's a great place to take your friends. And it's in the heart of downtown. The patio is a great place for people watching...

I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of opprtunistic flies hovering which was annoying. But they were gone after a few minutes. No big."
PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,3,"A childhood friend of mine from the Denver area was visiting Phoenix, and I wanted to take her out to dinner to a place that wasn't stuffy, somewhat hip and modern, with an interesting menu. Then I thought of Fez. My other girlfriends have raved about the place, and I was going to take their word for it.

It was a Tuesday night, the place was filled, but not packed, we quickly got a table and were gently reminded by the hostess that Tuesdays are when SKYY martinis are $5...you cannot even imagine how much my blood pressure went up when I heard these endearing words come out of the hostess' mouth! Wide-eyed, my friend and I quickly glanced at the martini/specialty drinks menu. I ordered the pomegranitini and she ordered the honeydew melon martini...

To accompany our dinner staples (the martinis, of course), she ordered shrimp kisra, and I, the lamb kisra. Not knowing what a ""kisra"" was, our waitress explained that it was a flatbread with all these toppings on it...simple enough.

The kisras came and they were basically pimped-out pizzas with more greenery than guys would like. My lamb was good...impressive, but not one of those: ""Holy molasses, maw, this here flattened bread with them fixin's on it really hits me right on the spot..oooo-eee!"" No, not one of those, but it was good enough for me to consider coming back and giving the other items in the menu a try. My friend quite enjoyed her shrimp kisra, and thought it was ""darn good for a Mediterranean-American fusion kind of grub."" No complaints. But by golly, we wanted more of whatever we were drinking! So we ordered another round.

Just as we were about to take a sip of our second round of drinks, guess who walks in?!!! Gov. Janet Napolitano. I quickly informed my friend that the Governor is dining here this evening, and she, at that point a bit inebriated, was just flat-out impressed with my choice of restaurant...brownie points for the Phoenician!

Of course, the rest of the evening I spent glancing over at the Governor's table trying to see if  she was taking advantage of the $5 SKYY martini special as well. I would've highly recommended the pomegranitini to her and her aide, and maybe the SKYY High (with dry vermouth) for her Secret Service-looking posse!

After the third round of -tinis, my friend and I both agreed that FEZ is worth visiting again...especially for the drinks. It's not the kind of restaurant hard-core foodies would be impressed with, but definitely the kind of place where a group of friends can just hang out and relax after a hard day's work...or a place where one can give the Governor a piece of his/her mind over tart apple martinis.

I think she'd like that..."

The ambiance is fit for that ""I-must-impress-her"" first date or that ""darn-I-forgot-our anniversary-again"" make-up and make-out dinner.

The ambiance is cozy and classy (white linens, and no red check table cloths) the staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the food...now that's important, especially if you don't understand Italian.

They serve lunch, and I've had their smoked chicken fettucine pasta, which is one of their lunch specials ($9-10?). The sauce was excellent--creamy, but not heavy, and punctuated with the saltiness of pancetta, if I'm not mistaken. The chicken was cooked (maybe grilled) just right, a bit on the smoky side to add another texture to the overall flavor.

Now if you are on that date--whether it be with your spouse, significant other, or whomever--you HAVE to start your dinner with some cocktails and appetizers at the bar, where they have Happy Hour from 4-7 p.m. Tues-Saturdays. The appetizers (calamari, baby!) are half-off, plus drink specials.

bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,5,"Went to Indulge Burgers for the first time after Ignite Phoenix After Hours. Wanted to stay there forever.

Here's the thing: If you're craving a burger, we all have several options. There's a fast food burger joint practically in every corner, and almost any ""American Fare"" restaurant and bar has their signature burger on their menu. Btu what sets Indulge Burgers apart is the opportunity to build your own--that's right BYOB (burger, that is). Now, all of a sudden, that burger you're wanting becomes a burger you'd kill for (maybe not to that extreme, but you get what I mean), because it will have everything you are looking for in a burger.

Their burgers are all about juiciness, and partnered with their brioche bread, become divine.

Ordered sweet potato fries with my lovely burger creation because, well, I heard it's better for you...whatever. It came with a dipping sauce on the side, which, at first glance, looked like some Italian dressing. But I was so wrong! This was the ish! The sauce is actually the liquefied, melted version of marshmallow cream/fluff with a dash of cinnamon. Some of you might think that the sauce might be too sweet and would ruin the meal and you all are so wrong! The sweetness of the fries and dipping sauce actually enhances the savoriness of my burger! That sauce was like crack and I wish they bottled it. I could not get enough of the fries and dipping sauce combo. I wanted to lick it clean but, I was all dressed nicely, you know.

Service was very good, and the staff was great and friendly. I love the place, I want to live there. Or at least live near them. But alas, I live all the way in Tukee. Boo-hiss.

So now I have two wishes: Please bottle your sweet (crack-like) sauce and open an Indulge Burgers in PHOENIX!"

Thanks to Chef Danielle (formerly of Sweet Pea Bakery), Lola's baked goods are worth dreaming about. If you ever find macarons (perhaps this is the French spelling?), then you have to purchase one or two because those things are to die for.

I like the ambiance, I like the staff and people who frequent it. It's a good crowd, mostly on their laptops or busy reading their books or newspapers.

Here's my one and only complaint: They don't make their drip coffee hot enough.

I'm a simple gal. I don't ask for those mocha, macchiato, extra foam, skinny-skinny, with drizzle and powder on top kinda drinks. I just want simple brewed coffee with some room for my cream.

The first time I purchased coffee at Lola's, it was served in a cup because I chose to drink it there. And it was already lukewarm, therefore, it was ""iced"" coffee by the time I had my second sip. The next time, I asked for it in a to-go cup, thinking that the lid might keep the coffee warmer longer. Alas, the drip coffee was lukewarm after my third sip. The last time I was there (3 days ago), I asked for them to put in a to-go cup again and to make it a little hotter than usual. Oh, it was hot alright, but maybe just 2 notches above their usual ""warm.""

I'm not looking for scalding coffee but just hot enough for me to enjoy hot coffee a little longer while reading the Arts section of the Arizona Republic (and there's really not much content in that section).

Can't a girl ever get hot coffee from there? That's all she asks."

Big-ass (can I use ""big-ass' as an adjective?) hoagies the way it's done in New York.

This place packs the meat in their hoagies, and I mean pack. In my book, they don't gyp you. They use Boar's Head meats, which is prime in the deli world, and they pack the other good stuff into their sandwiches, too, like tomatoes, peppers, whatever! Of course, it is a little pricier than your typical Subway, but c'mon...the meats, the bread, the accoutrements are waaay better. This new place, located smack downtown, is a hit among the big names in the Phoenix scene (politicians and high-powered City and State officials). You never know who you're going to run into.



Owners Nicole and Jay (who moved to Phoenix from, yes, New York), run the counter themselves, and let me tell you, they are characters. They will throw the f-bomb once in a while, but not in an offensive way. They do it in the most endearing New Yorker way.



I highly recommend this new deli joint. Buy one of their hoagies and you get two lunches out of it. And BTW, they do a ""Hungryman Breakfast sandwich"" and it is a cardiologist's nightmare, but a meat and breakfast lover's dream come true. This breakfast hoagie has breakfast potatoes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, and topped with American cheese for good measure. If you get one of these breakfast beauties, you might want to share with a friend...preferably a carnivore friend.



So check it out, will ya?"
2D2NpSJDyQCBKPRboUcKWQ,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,4,"So, it's a Saturday night and you are really aching for some Vietnamese food. You head on over to the tried-and-tested, everyone's favorite--Cyclo. But alas, there is a line, a LONG line. And no matter how much you beg and plead with owner in stilettos, Justina, she ain't budging. She sticks one finger at you and says, ""You just have to wait.""

Your stomach growls. What do you do?

Well you just drive a little to the north and try Anise Restaurant.

Located across from Lee Lee's, this little-known Vietnamese place serves pretty good Vietnamese pho (the chicken kind), which my dining partner ordered. The flavors were simple, almost true to what pho should really taste like (some I've tasted try too hard by overdoing spices and seasonings, and some also have this unexplainable greasy taste). I tried the Anise noodles as recommended by our waitress and it was pretty darn yummy! I had that with the summer rolls with peanut sauce on the side, and it was addicting. I was a pig, even for just an hour...I was a pig! And I loved every minute of it.

Oh, and just for kicks, my dining partner ordered the shrimp burschetta simply because that's his favorite item to order at Cyclo. And, the decision is: he still loves Cyclo's shrimp bruschetta. But this comes as a close second.

The service was excellent, the place...neat and tidy, which is great and pleasant. However, I must say that here is something about a small restaurant in frenzy, like what happens to Cyclo on a weekend. I think the bustle and demand for tables at Cyclo makes me appreciate the food over there more. It's like like acquiring a hot commodity and you kinda wanna go ""neener-neener"" to those who stand by  the door and wait their turn while they salivate.

At any rate, Anise is a good alternative. Definitely something that should always be considered when craving for Vietnamese food. The price is very reasonable, and it's an inviting place to take everyone on the family."
M5jKFdL0vLcBzdPh-mLnAQ,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,5,"Every third Thursday of the month (or so), this fabulous group meets and drinks and vents about their work load and the many ignoramuses (or is it ignoramii) they work with, while handing you their business card with a ""call me."" No it's not a dating service, it's Az Media Buzz, spearheaded by none other than network spearheading extraordinaire, Joel.

Anyway, the last time Az Media Buzz had a get-together, it was held at Bar Smith, tucked away in the middle of downtown, somewhere on Washington. The management extended their happy hour prices to the Az Media Buzz folks up to 8 p.m. (instead of the usual 7 p.m.) AND (the important part), they provided free appetizers, three chafing dishes full...and the group didn;t even ask for it! Now that was extra-special.

I personally didn't order any food because...well, I wasn't hungry. I was more ""thirsty"" if you get my drift. So for me to review them for their food would not be appropriate.

Instead, please allow me to review their service. I was lucky enough to meet the manager, this cute and compact Latino man wearing what looked to be a fauxhawk. I approached him,held out my hand, and gave him my sincerest thanks for hosting the group and providing free appetizers (what media person doesn't appreciate that?) to the group. His response to me was: ""O my goodness, I've been meaning to go over to your table and say HI but you were kinda intimidating.""

Bwahahaha! To that I say: ""Honey, I ain't intimidating...I'm only 5 feet tall! I don't bite. I may be loud as heck, but I am as friendly as any politician running for president right now!""

How sweet of him to even confess that? He gave me his card and gave me a quick tour of the place, and explained where the artwork on the walls are from. He informed me that they serve lunch and that I should give it a try, and for his friendliness, I will!

Kudos to that lovely manager for his one-on-one with customers.

Now, about my waiter/bartender--DALE. Red-head, already a plus in my book. The guy conversed with me a little bit (in-between serving the Buzz people) about Sol y Sombra chef's new restaurant OverEasy (which apparently was visited by some Yelpers and I wasn't invited...whatever!!!). He was definitely a friendly guy who mixed up some refreshing vodka collins for little ol' me the right way. He encouraged me to visit the rooftop bar, and I did. (That spot is perfect for a small to medium sized party on a balmy spring evening, I must say.) Dale was an absolute doll!

I see a lot of potential for this place...the employees are good people it seems. I have to stop by for lunch, though, so I can review them for their food. Bur for now, I am reviewing their service and the people and for that I give them 5 stars!

And I feel awful for Abbey having a bad experience, but I think that they just switched management, and things seem to be for the better. Ask for Mr. Madrigal next time...he's super-duper nice."

Yun (the manager or the owner? not sure) is just too friendly and funny. If you don't see something in the menu, or you want to combine a number of things from the menu...just ask Yun if he can accomodate. And he most likely can hook you up with what you are craving for."
qJf61TR4Jq9Xph5RiXPS9A,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,3,"My standard for crepes is from my favorite food truck, Truckin' Good Food.

I like this little joint, but it doesn't quite live up to my standard.

My dining companion, a junior crepe aficionado, ordered the turkey pesto crepe, which is supposed to have avocados and tomatoes, etc. Junior crepe aficionado complained that she hadn't bitten into an avocado yet halfway through her crepe, so she opened the darn thing only to find two measly pieces of avocado.

I had the BLT, which was pretty good, but again, missed the mark on the promised avocado.

Maybe avocados were not in season?

Most of the customers were enjoying items from the sweet crepes selection. My dining companions and I did, too. We shared the Nutella, strawberries and bananas topped with whipped cream...and really, how can you go wrong with that? It was delish.

I dig this place, and I was so glad to see the place packed with locals enjoying sweet and savory crepes, while working on their computers (they have free wi-fi BTW). The owners are friendly and they seem to know most of the people present, indicating that they have regulars. That's a good thing.

But there is a difference between my fave Truckin' Good Food's crepes and Cupz and Crepes'. There is a difference in the quality and richness of the ingredients used by both. You bite into a Truckin's crepe and the robustness of the flavors envelops you, leaving you sometimes speechless. You bite into Cupz and Crepes' offering and you say, ""It's good."" You feel me?

Would I recommend this joint. Yes, of course. It's a good breakfast place where you might just meet your neighbors. It's cozy, it's friendly...and you know... ""it's good."""

Divine! It even has a dark chocolate surprise somewhere deep in the bread pudding that i didn't expect, but totally went ape-shit when I found it.

The food was good and filling, and lots of variety. I'm a breakfast girl myself and their selection was a-ok, and their portions more than enough.

Here's my reason for not giving the place the fifth star:
I normally go on a Sunday brunch, the only time I have to enjoy a brunch. Now, I've got nothing against church-going people, but at that time, that's the crowd you get -- grandparents dressed to the nines, their hair perfectly did, smelling like a rose garden on steroids; the kids are wearing one of their best outfits and are itching to take them off; the hungry babies are in full force...and then there's me and my posse, walking in the restaurant with dark glasses and ratty jeans, unshowered, with a hint of morning breath. A little out of place right?

I'm going to go ahead and call us a little ""edgier"" than the Sunday crowd.

But...the Red Velvet bread pudding...GO!"
67zCgILB2h6JoSvFabVe7g,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,2,"I used to frequent AZ 88 when I used to live in the Scottsdale. I loved it for its setting--somewhat hidden, somewhat quiet, trendy enough but not too much that it suffocates. I enjoyed their food because of its simple decadence--sandwiches with no-frills sauces, grilled vegetables with a tangy sauce that doesn't over power, and their waffle fries that make you curse Atkins until his dead (oh, wait, he IS dead). Best of all, I enjoyed their drinks. Always refreshing, always exciting, and always seem to creep up to you when least expected giving you a pleasant buzz that makes  everyone around you appear like they're on high definition.

So, really the 2 measly stars are not for the food, ambiance, or drinks. They're for SLADE.

It's been a couple of years (or more) since we visited AZ 88. I thought of going there for dinner last weekend to celebrate Fathers Day. Afterall, it used to be one of my husband's favorite eating joints. So  I invited my parents, my kids and of course my husband, to have a quiet enjoyable dinner over there.

We immediately found a table for 6--a good sign. Everything was going great until SLADE came along. Slade was our slick, ""I-really-ought-to-be-in-LA-acting"" waiter. The minute he saw our group, he immediately put on his scowl face and his ""why-do-I-end-up-with-these-people"" attitude. Was it the kids? Or was it the rare Asian people who made up our group?

(And just a note: my kids grew up eating in restaurants--from SeaSaw to In and Out, and yes they've eaten at AZ 88 before. They've done it all because I don't cook. They even order mom's drinks...for her, of course. And yes, my parents speak English...like the kind you can understand!)

Two seconds after settling to our table, he asks what we would like to drink. I have never felt pressured in my life to think of an alcoholic concoction. Five seconds had passed, and Slade was already sending off telepathic messages to me, saying ""hurry up, bitch, you're wasting my time."" So I finally blurted out, ""Could you please give us a couple of minutes to think. We'd like to see a drink menu, if we could."" He grabbed a drink menu, plopped it on the table, and quickly pivoted and sashayed away from our table without saying a word.

I don't know about you, but I thought that was rude.

When we finally decided on our drink orders, Slade's OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) became apparent. He couldn't care less if we had enough ketchup, or if we needed more tangy sauce for the vegetables, or if we needed any kind of condiment to compliment our respective meals.

All he cared about was making sure that each of our drinks was set on a napkin.

He watched each of us like a hawk, making sure that, as we set our glass down, it was placed on a napkin! One time, my son unknowingly set his water glass on HALF the napkin, and Slade was right there to set things right for him, accompanied with an annoyed sigh, of course. Never once did he ask if we needed anything else...he just wanted to make sure that our glasses were on napkins!

Thank god for the food, and the drinks. Those did not fail us. My husband enjoyed that part. But SLADE, and his OCD, oh and his over-gelled hair...that's gotta go!

Thus 2 stars."
nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,3,"Food-wise, I'd give the place another star, but the waitress ruined it for me. La Stalla is located across from the historic San Marcos hotel. It is a very intimate place, bordering sappy-romantic, Italian restaurant.

I dined here for a business talk with  possible clients (two awesome children's book authors, by the way). They love this place and I don't blame them.  The food is excellent! I had the gnocchi with tomato sauce, topped with slices of fresh mozarella. It wasn't the most divine gnocchi I've ever tasted, but it was certainly delectable. I wished the gnocchis were a little less play-do like (not that I've ever tasted play-do) and a bit more pillowy. Can't complain about the sauce.

One of my dining partners had chicken soup, which seemed the perfect food for that rainy evening. The other had the chicken marsala, which was devoured heartily. The heavily sauced plate was wiped clean with fresh-baked bread and olive oil. Yes, it's that good!

Oh, and the pinot noir from the Russian River area was superb. it was delicate and the aroma was not overwhelming...just the way I prefer.

Here's the problem : KIM. She was our waitress and I think she really should take a lesson about ""when to butt in without being rude."" Don't get me wrong, she was attentive...in fact too attentive, bordering rude. Remember that this was a business dinner meeting so we had a lot of topics to cover, and KIM managed to butt in at anttime stopping the momentum of what I and my possible clients were discussing. It was flat out annoying. I would be in a middle of a sentence, and she would blurt out, ""care for some more bread, are you doing alright?"" Don't you think that she should've waited for the window of pause and ask that question when that arose?!!!

Well, I didn't finish my pasta dish because KIM kept asking evey 10 minutes if I was done with my meal. Annoying!

Anyway, I highly recommend the place because of their food. But by golly, run out the door if the waitress introduces her self as KIM."
wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw,PUfrbn2Ij-iyyOnM_EzQtg,1,"On January 4, twenty of my friends and I had a dinner at Humble Pie on 7th Street.

Two days before the date, I spoke to someone who took my original reservation for 15 w/o any problems. I also informed her that we will want separate checksI'm sure, to which she said that it wouldn't be a problem. On 1/4 around 2 p.m.., I called again to confirm the reservation at 5 p.m. and also informed the guy on the other line that the reservation will now be for 20 not 15. He said it wouldn't be a problem, but noticed that the note on the reservation said ""separate checks."" He then said that Humble Pie CANNOT do separate checks for groups of 8+ because that's their policy. I wish that I was given the correct information when I first called because that would've changed my decision to have the dinner there. Some of my guests were just going to stop by and not stay long for dinner. At that point, it was too late to find a place and inform all 20 guests of the change, so I stuck with it. But for the record, I was already annoyed that a staff member did not know an important restaurant policy that should've been ingrained from the firstday of training. The reasoning I was given for the ""one check policy"" was: ""You only have one server for the evening..."". That sounded like a recipe for poor customer service.

Well, that's pretty much what we got that evening.

1. As a guest was finishing up his Kiltlifter, he noticed that there was a piece of ""ice"" at the bottom of the glass, which he thought was odd for beer. As he got the piece of ""ice"" in his mouth, he realized it was a piece of broken glass. Luckily, my guest is so even-keeled that when he informed our waitress that evening of the broken glass, he didn't make a big fuss and just told the waitress to inform the bartender in case there are other shards lying around. She said that earlier in the day, a glass or two did break/shatter and the piece was probably one of the remnants. My other friend then got worried and checked her Kiltlifter from the bottom and noticed that the bottom of her pint glass was cracked.

The incident was clearly NOT the waitresses' fault and she quickly told us that both beers will not be charged. My guests were grateful and they each received another pint of Kiltlifter. Luckily, my guest didn't order a diet Coke first, which is his usual, because if he had, he wouldn't have even seen that piece of glass coming, and probably sucked on it like ice. But he didn't make a fuss because well, sh*t happens.

2. Then the SAME guest ordered his burger with no cheese because of dairy allergies. Everyone ordered pizza or wings. People got their food served, but an HOUR AND A HALF after he placed his order, he still hadn't gotten his burger. Again, the waitress was apologetic but at that point he didn't want the burger. You would think that they'd give him extra attention after the glass incident, but no. He didn't say anything because that isn't his personality and he knew that I would be upset. And since it was my birthday dinner he didn't make a fuss to ruin the evening. Some of my guests asked for water and that was a little difficult to get, too.

3. After all this inconvenience, we were hoping that they could honor our request for separate checks. But there were inconsistencies--some were granted that request and then some were not. Frustrating! To be honest, she was good for the most part doing her job solo. She probably would've gotten a 20+% gratuity anyway from each of the guest

Now imagine this concept, if there were maybe  2 servers or maybe 1 1/2 servers for our party, the poor service wouldn't have happened. One of them would've noticed that while everyone else was eating, one guest wasn't. Our waitress was not only waiting on our tables but other tables as well.

Humble Pie, look at it from our perspective: my guest, who sucked on a piece of broken glass and was not served his burger (but instead a consolation pepperoni pizza, which, according to the waitress, was ordered but she can't figure out who ordered it, but it didn't matter anyway because my guest is allergic to dairy) was forced to pay part of the gratuity that was included in the bill. For bad service.

And we're not faulting the waitress, who was working her a** off that evening, we fault poor management. I think you've done her a disservice because she seems awesome, but physically, you can only do so much.

I've supported this establishment when it was The Living Room and I wanted to support  Humble Pie because I support local. Sometimes good food is not enough.  Anyone can get ""good food"" anywhere and they are plentiful out there, but selling an experience is an art. I'm not complaining because I'm asking for compensation or a freebie. But I am asking you to consider how you manage the restaurant."

S8FDnhP4WKlRhJxSIkcxFg,75kTRzS6nNJs4Qwe_4a8eA,4,"I made reservations for my husband's birthday party in person in July and when I called to confirm the reservation two days before the event in August the hostess said they didn't have my reservation and quickly put me on hold to get the manager. Bruce, the manager, got on the phone and diffused the situation. I showed up on Friday, September 1st with my 10 guests and we had two bays side by side waiting for us. Celeste, our server, was lovely and handled all the separate tabs like a pro. All my guests had a great time and we loved the food! We will be back. Just make sure to make reservations!"
UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,75kTRzS6nNJs4Qwe_4a8eA,4,I love this place. I have been there a couple of times and the food and services is always top notch. Try the filet mignon salad or the french dip! They are soooo good!

We had the hummus board and it was so good. The wood oven bread with the honey citrus butter was divine.  I had the Timo Shellfish trio and it was good. The sriracha shrimp and the scallops were nice but the citrus ceviche was disappointing. My friend let me have a bite of her crab cake benedict and that is what i am having next time! IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!!!!"

During our meal the managers on duty both came by to say hello and to make sure we were having a lovely time. I really enjoyed the lamb chops with a side of mushrooms and I paired it with a yummy Pinot Noir! The valet remembered my friend's name when he dropped of his car and it has been a while since he was there!! Impressive!

The pace for this place is relaxed so you can not be in a rush to dine here so make sure you like the person/people you are with. Renee, our server, was wonderful and each staff member took the time to explain the dishes when they dropped them off. The pistachio soup and the duck confit gnocchi were my favorites! Here's a tip, don't wear heels like I did."

We had a lovely booth so we can admire the scenery while we ate. The server, Olga, was very friendly and efficient. We had the pot stickers and the peppers to start and they were good. I had the Kobe hotdog and my husband had the burger and they were good. I was hoping for amazing but we got good. I would go back with out of town guests to show off the view. The ceiling had cobwebs hanging down too."

tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg,75kTRzS6nNJs4Qwe_4a8eA,3,"We went there on a Monday night for a birthday dinner. The ambiance is lovely. The food was great. The service.....meh. Sydney, the hostess, was perky and helpful. It was our server assistant and our server that lacked polish, professionalism and knowledge. It was very surprising considering the reputation of Ocean Prime. The server assistant just kept walking back and forth not pouring our sparkling water. We had to do it ourselves. Our appetizers came at different times because the server didn't understand we wanted two orders of the oysters. Our champagne took a long time. And at one point a man in a suit came by and asked if everything was good? We answered and he walked away. Who was he? A manager? The owner? Some drunk customer?  We don't know. The server responded to our questions with ""I don't know"", ""Let me check"",  ""I suppose"". And her hair was very messy. It was a pony tail with the sides down. All of it should be pulled back. We counted the tables and there were seven including ours. The service could have definitely been better with the amount of tables in the dinning room.

I would go back because maybe it was an off night. Like I said, the food was great. The Alaskan Halibut was delicious!"

My all time favorite lunch place. Thanks"

The sub's are generously layered in prime tasting meats with fresh greens and tomatoes. Bread holds up to the build while transporting it home to be consumed in front of the game. Living back east and in Italy, this place lives up to the 5 star rating. Thanks"

Took my wife there for her birthday because she loves German food; and we both were disappointed. The pretzel was really good and the service was great, but the atmosphere and food was below par."

It's my go-to place when I am with friends, clients, etc. And looking for a place to just sit, eat, drink, and socialize. Their beverage menu is very impressive and changes all the time. Every time I come here there is something new to try. Highly recommend this place!"

QsMR_Fp9YRtDegThsOgFLA,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"Love it.  Johnny Chu has a fantastic little spot here in cenpho.  The food was fantastic, reasonably priced for small plates and the sake selection is THE BEST in town.  You'll spend a pretty penny on the best sake but its well worth it to pair with some terrific eats.

Get the Yakitori shrimp with head on.  Eat the heads, the shells everything.  Food does not get any better than this.  These delicious skewers are sweet and crunchy and you have to eat everything to get the full delicious flavor.  Can't eat the head?  What are you doing in an asian restaurant?  Eat some Tofu then, Johnny has some great vegetarian options too.

Midway through our meal our server (terrific service!) offered some housemade lychee shochu shots.  Thank you, they were fabulous!

Another favorite was the soup dumplings.  These were so good I wanted another serving right away, but it'll have to wait for next time.

I think we ate about 10 plates here and every one of them was different, delicious and top notch in presentation, flavor and construction.

The final desert were two homemade jam filled fried empenadas...well, definitely not an empenada, but so delicious hot and sweet that they were the perfect end to a terrific meal.

Thanks Johnny, your place is a now favorite.  I can't wait to go back!"
ropJyZdmv6NeDU2Vz1I_Hg,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,3,"Their American menu is pretty so-so...not impressed.  Most people order the American Chinese menu for food here.  But for the families that come in (Chinese and otherwise) they know to get the Dim Sum, its very delicious with real Chinese options for those that dare to eat real Chinese food.

This is probably one of the best options for Dim Dum in the valley, though the place on 35th Ave and Camelback is pretty good too - but I'm not giving either of them rave reviews."
8Zqh2jwtncA3N4fWEMTvZQ,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"Kind of an industrial jetson's theme (check out the entry to the restrooms, very cool).  Staff was friendly, food was very good.  Get the gouda and applewood bacon brizza!  its large enough for two or for heating up in the oven the next day.

Drinks and sides are a bit pricey.  But I'll be back soon for another brizza, its one of the best things I've had for breakfast in a long time.  Delicious!"
SEH79jbg5Q8cCozCnhqMHA,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,5,"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!

We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!

Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!

Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!

Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!

We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!

We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley."
9Uju4PPwIKNrBUOfsjBbkw,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,1,"We were not greeted when we walked in the door.  The lady running the counter gave us a surly look and went back to restocking the counter items.  Then, after she changed the small garbage bucket, while wringing garbage juice off her hand, she asked what we wanted.

We just stopped in for a snack and I had wanted to try their food, so we ordered the sliders to share along with some sweet potato fries and a tea.  No thank you or smile or anything, we were obviously just in her way.

Our sliders arrived with sweet potato fries that were obviously sitting out for the day.  Cold, lifeless and disgusting.  I went back inside and asked for a fresh batch and got dirty looks from everyone.

While waiting for the fresh fries, we ate the sliders, which were pretty good.  The burger, bun, onions and cheese were tasty, something I'd be happy having again.  But not with service like this and I also noticed that mid afternoon while the staff stood behind the grill eating (2 people observed eating while working, one was garbage juice hand girl), the main garbage remained overflowing with disgusting refuse spattered on the white garbage stand.  Ick.

While the sliders were fine and the fresh fries were pretty decent, the service, attitude, people eating during their shift and lack of clean up were not something I'd like to plan my meal around.  I predict an upcoming health code violation.  No gold or silver stars in their future..."
gHutuGMMMH-5Qv9DbemLFw,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"I love family owned restaurants and will gladly try any place that isn't a franchise.  I was very surprised to go in on a Saturday morning and the place was bustling with activity and lots of diners, all of whom looked to be regulars and quite happy with their morning blintz or eggs.  I ordered a pumperdine bagel with lox, cream cheese and onions and it was top notch and piled high with lox.  Delicious.  Love the deli pickles, very authentic, not your normal over vinegared store brand.

I would love to go back soon, after seeing their list of smoked fish...I love a good deli with fish choices and I can't wait to also try a corned beef sandwich."
0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"it's good, very good, but for a Vietnamese place, has a very short menu with limited choices.

And for the biggest knock on the place, no fish sauce on the table.  Huh?  Well, judging from the lunch crowd, none of the people that eat there would know what it is anyway.  Not a Nguyen in the place other than the people running it.  (joke for those of you with Smith for last name!)  No big deal.

Pho Tai was very good, I love having green onions in the soup, but I doubt it is traditional.  The accessory bowl was short a few green items but all very fresh.  The broth very nice, though I think salty, but mmm, good.

Service was excellent.  Ambience different than I expected.  Small, quaint, clean, lots of awards on the wall, which I'm sure are well deserved.

The spring rolls were very tasty, though not traditional with dried pork, but the crispy and very yummy grilled pork and shrimp were delicious with the right hint of mint.  mmmm.  Very good peanut sauce to go with it, though I'm a fish sauce fan, which I didn't get to try THIS time.  Next time I will.

I also tried the preserved lemon soda.  Delicious!

I think if this place was close by, I'd eat here a lot.  A nice Pho can't be beat and I would love to give their other menu items a chance."
Af7BsyzsJi_2qPFu_5tsJg,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,3,"This place is just starting to come back.  When it opened, Jay was the owner and it was fabulous.  He sold the business and left back to Korea and the quality slipped, a TV was put in on the wall and the food started to stink, literally.  Soon after the health department had a big problem with their cleanliness.

We quit going for almost a year then stopped in and found a new Japanese sushi chef in charge.  The TV was now TWO TV's but the food was very good.  They still have the all you can eat sushi for $22.95 but we've never tried that.  We always order off the menu and its been very good as of late.  Try the churashi sushi for a change...tea is very good, miso soup is average, sake selection is the usual hakatsuru which is fine with me.  Haven't seen the crazy milk (sake) there lately but it was a favorite.  Not many selections beyond the basic fish.  The new chef does make a smashing quail egg however."
spnbqpkQsY79i5dL5qiRUg,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,3,"Can get very crowded and smokey most nights, show up early and get a good seat in a booth or grab a beer at the bar, park in the back of the building if the front is crowded.

Nice selection of beers on tap, not just your usually domestics.  Good selection of wine....and the food is pretty good too.  Very spicy so expect it, don't go here and ask for mild food, just won't happen.  And prepare to laugh at the $27 fish tacos that's always on the special board...haha, most expensive fish tacos in the universe by far.  Very consistent eats, always spicey yet flavorful and good."
SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"This has always been our favorite local Chinese take out - and especially on Chinese New Year, the special menu.  OMG its good.  We always call for takeout, one or two items and we are so close that by the time I get in the car and drive there, its done...less than five minutes.

This place gets very busy, and if you get a chance, try out their Peking Duck, Hong Kong style.  Soooo delicious!

Another favorite is the snow pea leaves (not on the menu!!!  cost extra), and the Seafood Bean Curd Soup.  I love the soup here, so many delicious morsels, you can't go wrong with it ever."
xsFeeqZS6PoVvwseEefzEw,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,2,"We've been eagerly anticipating the opening of PastaBAR since we heard of it, and we love the location near Sens, Breadfruit and now Turf Accountant.

Let's start out by saying we are huge fans of hand made fresh pasta.  But read on...

We showed up about 7pm on a Thursday and were the only patrons in the place...another group showed up when we were finishing.

The decor is nice, I like it.  The servers were very friendly and attentive.  The bar / wine list was not yet available, but we went in expecting this as we knew about the license pending.

Let's talk about the food and presentation.

Starters:
There were plastic packaged crunchy breadsticks on our plates - ok, tasty enough.  It would be nicer if the kitchen sent out something small and hand made instead.

We tried the Fritto Misto, a deep fried appetizer trio: stuffed/deep fried olives:  tasty and interesting, not a bad start.  The broccollini was not as good, a bit greasy, but still interesting.  The deep fried risotto was probably the best thing they have, I really enjoyed it.  All were served on a plain white plate.

Pastas:
We were told the portions were small, 4-6oz, so we decided to order and share 3 pastas and get a few tastes for the evening.   All were served in plain white bowls (which is fine), but as a whole they all just had too many flavors that overwhelmed the pasta, especially any with the hot peppers.  The gianciale was interesting as a bacon in the pasta, but all around, the pastas tasted heavy, possibly over-egged, too garlicky, and one even had bread mixed in with the sauce...very odd.

The gnocchi was way too spicy, the gnocchi itself was actually nicely made, but the sauce completely blanketed any flavors the pasta might have had.  You wouldn't know it was gnocchi other than the texture and shape.  Aren't you here for the sauce AND the pasta?  Why take so much time to lovingly hand prepare a pasta if you are going to kill it with a poorly made sauce?

We did not finish but a portion of each bowl, it wasn't interesting or good enough.   We eat Italian several times a week and even though in most cases our favorite Italian restaurant (Marcellino Ristorante) costs more, the quality, flavors, presentation and service are far better than the food and service here.  A $19 Pacatelli al Ragu di Salsiccia at Marcellino completely blows away a $17 anything here.  There is no comparison.

This place hasn't mastered pasta yet, unfortunately....and this is the chef from Sassi I believe...maybe we were there on a bad night?  But three strikeouts in three pastas...just doesn't cut it.  It wasn't good enough, it was way too overwrought.

Desert:
Skipped, they only offered italian ice.

I think the chef is trying to be too creative here.  Either that or I am used to more subtelty, higher quality, or even more mastery in the making of pastas and the pairing of hand made sauces.

Both of us agreed that we probably wouldn't come back, even though we always like to give a restaurant more than one chance.  It just didn't show any kind of mastery of Italian food at all.  Just too many conflicting flavors that did nothing for the pasta.

On the way out we stopped at Sens and were nicely received by Johnny Chu and we had a nice bottle of Sake as our dessert.  We were so impressed by their menu and cold Sake selection that we went back the next night and had some of the best asian fusion we've had!  (Review pending).   mmm, Yakitori shrimp with head on.  Crunchy goodness!

Summary:
If you are in the neigborhood, you have better options for a nice dinner for a better price.  Sens, Cheuvront, Breadfruit..  but if you want Italian food...this isn't the place.

But give them a try, my review is my own.  My palate is different and I'm sure many people will love this place, it might be a match for you.

I do wish them success.  This is a tough economy and maybe all that is needed is a few tweaks to the sauces - a little more subtlety and fewer ingredients that work well together might make this place worth revisiting."
WOz66UuVsfc2K9GxzfDnGg,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,3,"America's Taco shop is in a cool little house on 7th St.  I'll make this review short and sweet:  they have some great carne asada, but something is wrong with the tacos...they have lettuce...maybe they have an option to get them with onions and cilantro?  I don't know maybe my taco sense is off, but I am more of a fan of the roadside taco stands with simple good tacos for cheap...like they have at El Gran Taco....tacos de cabeza, de lengua...mmmm, real mexican.

Although I wouldn't drive out of the way to go to this place, I loved the vibe, and I would like to try their ceviche, tostadas, hot dogs and corn.  It all looked fabulous and one couple must have eaten one of everything on the menu... I was jealous.

Yes, I'd definitely go back, it showed promise...maybe I was too harsh with the lettuce on my tacos.  They were pretty tasty and the salsa was a nice smoky flavor...and I really liked the carne asada.

I'll see how round two goes....I have good hopes for a successful lunch or dinner here."
W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,1,"I went in expecting a very nice fish taco, but the porridge/mush that passed for fish was fishy and nasty... how's that for the start of a review?

Ok, the place is nicely enough furnished if you think a la chuy's or chipotle's metal furnishings but with more crap on the walls.  It's clean, the people were pleasant and nice and the counter service fine.

The wife ordered a hotdog, i'm sure she'll review that.  I wasn't impressed.  But let's get to the rest of the food.  I ordered the 3 pack of tacos for $5.  Ok price.

Green beef, pork and fish.  All of them came wrapped in aluminum foil with sticky but cold flour tortillas and the same mess of cabbage, tomato and white and yellow cheese.  All were freezing cold which made the meat luke warmish.

They were all a miss for me.  I would not step back in this place for a taco.  Fatty pork is fine, if its cooked nicely, but this was not. Green beef was ok, as long as I piled the pretty good tomatillo salsa over it.  The fish...let's leave it at ugh.  If this is their specialty, it's over already.

This is Sunnyslope, and with the authentic delicious taco and burrito choices around here, this place is only competing with the tacos across the street at Jack in the Box, and I would probably eat those before I'd touch another one of these, it was that bad for me.

Sorry, hippies.   This wasn't good.  If you are going to come into a Mexican part of town you'd better bring the meat to compete.  You are far outclassed in taco land.

So, after some thought I decided rather than just pan the place, I'm giving suggestions:
1. use a paper or wax paper between the aluminum and taco, or you have a mess.
2. do something with that too cold cabbage/cheese/tomato
3.  grill the fish and don't smother it / chop it up.  make sure its fresh.
4.  get a better cut of pork, go organic (maybe it is), season it better
5.  keep the happy people in front, they were nice
6.  don't blend your lemonade with ice, it was awful and too sweet
7.  quit buying your chips at Costco, those round ones suck
8.  do something with the guacamole, it was ok just being avocado and lime, but it was pureed.  keep it chunky.
9.  get more input from your mexican chefs, they probably know what is wrong
10. Both the red and green salsas were good, just need a taco to go with it."
FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"We saw that they were open on the Chow Bella blog yesterday and decided to go last night.  It felt just like going to the 40th St location, same menu, decor...but somehow better.

We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and a bruschetta and were very pleased with the service and quality of food.  The place was packed!  I think this neighborhood has been waiting for something like this for some time.

I won't miss the old Katz Deli too much though it was a part of local history; the new Postino is a welcome change and I love the openness of the back bar and patio.  It's a nice place and we will be back!

Oh, and expect to hear a lot of 80s new wave music, at least that's what was playing when we showed up...the Cure, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode seem to be their theme.

Like their other location, expect the finest breads from MJ Bread as well as tasty treats from Tammie Coe Cakes.  mmmmm.

And you'll need to use the valet unless you get there between 11-4 (and you'll get $5 wine for being early)."

This is one of three in this location that will be opened, coming soon, Canteen and El Rey...so I've been told.

After you get through the very heavy front door (grandma is not going to eat tonight if she has to handle that door) you'll notice the place has been improved quite nicely with metal framed windows, door frames and a large mirror.  Also notable are the 70s style prints throughout the cozy space.  Although it's still warm (they're working through A/C issues), you'll find the staff and kitchen (visible) will greet you with a smile and in our case at the soft opening, a choice of a glass of chilled chardonnay or a cold sake!

The menu is still in flux and not all items were available, but the selection was still quite large.  We sampled quite a few items and in most cases, they were all very tasty.  The prices for the items available ranged from $8 to $13 for the starters, and when the full entrees are available, they appear to be in the $15-20 range.

Bottles of wine are $30-40, with glasses from $8-13.  The selection is fairly minimal with only about 7 reds and 5-6 whites from Spain, New Zealand, South America, and California.  Cold Sakes are $12 for 300ml (a bit high) and there are about 5 choices.  I find these prices slightly high for the quality of wines and sakes available, but at the bottled wine price, not so bad.  As much as I love chilled sake, unless there is a special I probably will pass unless the quality improves.

Food:  Along with the fantastic service, we found the food to be very delicious.  We started with the duck confit buns, which are really a play on Hong Kong style duck where you'd make up your bun, crispy duck skin, hoisin sauce and shrimp cracker...  however this version consisted of a larger Hong Kong style steamed bun, duck confit, a different play on the sauce and green onion along with a slice of green apple.  I thought the confit was good, but not excellent (like Christopher's), the steamed bun too sticky (over steamed?) but all around not a bad effort.  I think this one can only improve and I will try it again as I love confit.  This was the only item I thought that needed some work, it could have just been the gooey bun that threw me off.

All of the other items were top notch, very flavorful and perfect temperatures with the right amount of seasonings.  Some items such as the Shrimp and Coconut fried rice were spicier than you'd expect but well within reason and added a little kick to make them perfect.

The fried rice was excellent, I really loved having the texture of the shaved coconut with the rice and although a lot of egg, it was the perfect amount to make it rich and delicious.  I would actually prefer a small poached egg or overeasy quail egg on the top just to get some yolky goodness, I guess I'll have to do that at home with the leftovers...

The shrimp lettuce wraps were among my favorites, nice spicy perfectly fried shrimp in a cool lettuce wrap.  As all starters come in threes, these are difficult to share with two....  I will order this again next time, it's a nice cool and spicy treat.

My very top favorite was the pork belly crepe.  Although the crepe in texture was not so different from the 'bun' of the confit dish, the crepe with the pork belly is absolutely magnificent paired with the wasabi yogurt.  This was pork belly at its best (well, yes, Filipino fans, you know the other best pork belly), but Matt's subtle and delicious pork is among the tastiest I've had.  He knows his pork and the belly he serves here in several incarnations is well worth the trip.

The last dish was dessert, which the wife had the blueberry (cake?) and lychee ice cream all made on site.  Very sweet but perfectly delicious.  I cannot pass up tapioca and this paired with toasted coconut, strawberries, and butterscotch was a fine finish to a terrific meal.  I actually might have preferred the tapioca with only (add more please) coconut, but the overlarge (shareable) portion was a nice subtle and not oversweet finish to a very nice meal.

This is a nice destination for a delicious meal and I can't wait for the weather to cool off so that they can open up the large garage doors and open the interior to the beautifully set up patio.  Inside they have about 11 tables (2 and 4 tops) and outside looks like a treat once the weather behaves.  I think this is going to be a hot spot when the cool weather starts."
Nf1ZtgHwg0Mu5lOaJYgDGQ,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"Very crispy thin slices that have terrific toppings.  Yes, the pizza is pre-made and on display under glass on the counter (9-10 different varieties at lunch) but they give it a couple of minutes in the oven before they serve it to you.

The key to this place I think is to get there when they open or after they start making their dinner pizzas.  Fresh and hot is best.

I really like this place.  Its simple, good and the value is pretty decent for the size of the slice.

I really enjoy any of their pesto pizzas and greek pizzas.  Very good."
mIZRTk10-YmWRVaxhC1hjg,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"I think many of these reviews might be friends of the family, but my wife and I met up with my father and mother along with my brother and sister in law for a dinner here.  There were a few people ordering to go, but we came for a meal and the six of us filled the restaurant.  Don't expect to find a lot of room, there are a few chairs but not a lot!  If it's full, it's full.

Anyway, though (I think) many of these reviews are relatives, they are spot on.  It's a good place to eat Filipino food.

Everything I tasted from the lumpia to the adobo was excellent.  And the mother/daughter/son running the place were so nice and helpful it felt like eating at home.  I want to go back very soon, especially on a Friday when they have some delicious pig, i think it's called lechon baboy.  mmmm.

Don't expect gourmet, silverware or place settings.  Expect good (excellent) home cooked Filipino with a twist of Mexican.  This is what you really want, go eat some!"
a1KXovXPdeDurOrER4ST6A,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,2,"Average sushi here, pretty good lunch specials.  Nothing to write home about but if you are hungry and in the area, its a decent meal.  Prices are mid to high for sushi.  Come in, eat, get out..."
-A9sm-E6uQxWTJ_MuyOzFw,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,3,"Average to great sushi and I eat a lot of sashimi and sushi.  Do get the sake sampler if you like sake, you'll get a rack of sake that'll feed your senses and get you ready for a raw fish treat.  Presentation is pretty nice, service is very good and the outside patio is a nice place to eat...I've never sat inside, what for, we live in Arizona, its nice out side!  Lots of unusual rolls and the tempura is pretty good too.  Sashimi is very nice, get a combo plate and save a few bucks."
CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,5,"The person above with 'duplicate review' has a link to a different restaurant.  This is Hana Japanese Eatery on 7th St.

Corkage, byob!
This is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now.  Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own sake, wine or beer (just stop at AJ's on Camelback and Central on your way in).

Incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi, always fabulous specials on the board, and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi.

Service can be excellent to horrible (had a very bad server at lunch once) but is normally excellent, this is a family run business and the Japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes.

Make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi, even if it isn't on the short menu.  They are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available.  I had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i've had anywhere in the world here.  And the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world.  I'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good.   One night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that I will order any time I see it available, amazing flavor and texture, very japanese.  mmmm.

Not open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday, closed on Mondays.  Regular hours through the week."
pu7maVMRHbIUv2x3B_xMHQ,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,2,"Ah, Rico's, I sure wanted to like you.  Located in the former Lantana Grill, you are the same but with a pickaxe and shovel on the wall.  Same buffet at breakfast, now priced $18.50.  I'm sure it's ok if you want a buffet, or a fresh omelette but that's not my usual style.

I have to say your salmon benedict ($13.85) was very tasty, a nice salmon on a crispy muffin with a perfect egg.  The potatoes however looked greasy, flabby and probably right off the buffet.  That's exactly how they tasted.  Ugh.  And my orange juice at $4 for 4oz, well, let's just say for that price it had better be freshly hand squeezed by virgins and not poured into a carafe from a box.  This was not fresh juice.

Your website says ""Rico's American Grill brings high-quality, farm-to-table cuisine at an affordable price.""  I disagree. With places like Scramble offering better food, better prices as well as free wi-fi, you are only going to gouge your Hotel guests, not your local neighbors: so we'll stay away."
6ZIHxvFTHC1pvAzAS0uLDA,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"I had always thought this was a Chandler restaurant, not a California chain, but the instant I walked in the door and saw how institutionalized it looked, I knew it had to be a chain.  But a damn cool one at that.

How many places have a Baguette factory pumping out fresh baguettes every 30 minutes?  Yeah, they aren't MJ Bread quality, but hoo ya momma, they are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and yum good!

I ordered a lemondade (hand made, caused a delay, three orders behind me got their sammiches first), but it was fresh and tasty, though smallish (12oz with ice?).

And the funny part was the only Vietnamese in the place (18-19 year old girl) running the cash register warned me that my shredded pork (#8) had fish sauce on it and it was 'an acquired taste!'  I loved it.  The first time I had fish sauce I was in love.

The only other sandwich shop that hit me in the yummer like this one was Birley's on Market Street in SFO.

I wish it was closer to home!"
9D7h2xfVJrGkkwXDsnfV_Q,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"The food here is excellent.  I have yet to have ANYTHING that was less than delicious.  Their stuffed croissant sandwiches are perfectly made every time, crispy and tasty.  This is a coffee shop...I've never had the coffee, but we end up here for lunch several times a week- they have a full lunch menu, mostly sandwiches, but you can't go wrong with any of them.

If I've put on any weight lately (likely) its because they are very good bakers here, their muffins and especially their chocolate chip cookies (ask for them warmed, if they aren't already, early morning muffins are always warm and freshly baked on site).  Amazingly good.

I give them less than five stars for one reason:   their prices are a bit steep for the area.  But its good.  I'll be going back very soon."
pBFewLcdLnf1XwPTE4jtyQ,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,3,"No cider? Really?

Q9is4jcGh5FT_1sAKilu6g,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,3,"The first time I ever came here was on that national donut day where you could buy a donut and get another one free. The marshmallow/chocolate one was okay but the cereal one was INCREDIBLE. It was the best donut I ever had in my life.

I went back for my stepdads birthday and custom ordered a half dozen of them and the 2nd time around they were just okay. Kind of dry/stale? Not even close to the first time.

Then I went back AGAIN to try their breakfast/brunch stuff and that was meh also. Also for some reason I ordered the eggs benedict and they didn't put salmon on it?! I was really disappointed about that. The sauce was pretty good and I was happy because it's dairy-free and I am lactose intolerant. My friends had pizza and a waffle. The waffle was delicious but the pizza was weird."
HjXI6lKGPVNQ8dYJPtaOCg,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,3,"I have two reviews in one, but I will start with tonight's. All I have to say is, it seems, from other reviews, that this place needs a new delivery guy.

I call to ask to get a pizza delivered - I chose mellow mushroom because they have vegan pizza (I am severely lactose intolerant) because last time I had their vegan pizza in-house, I liked it a LOT and had a craving. Due to some issues that don't need to be gotten into, I cannot go there myself and get it, so I asked for delivery.

When I told the girl where I lived (on Guadalupe), she said she thought they stopped delivery at Baseline but would go ask. The girl (who was very nice) comes back on the phone and says the delivery guy is ""in a bad mood tonight"" and said no and when she explained that I am (apparently) only 2 miles out of their zone, he said ""I don't answer to you."" I asked to speak to the manager and she said ""he was standing right there when I asked.""


REALLY? What the heck kind of place is this? What kind of boss stands around and lets employees talk to each other like that (from what I hear, the delivery jerk is related to the boss, so maybe that's it?)

My second review, from 2 times of actually being at this restaurant, is the same. The food, except for the vegan pizza (which is SO GOOD, but kind of on the expensive side...) isn't very good. I ordered the cinnamon honey pretzels and they were so dry they weren't edible. The garlic/cheese bread is also incredibly dry.

If they would have been willing to work with me on the delivery, I *might* have given them 3 stars, but for the bad attitude this place seems to constantly have, they only get 2. Which is really a bummer, because their vegan pizza is so good.

EDIT!!: Alright, so a few hours after I wrote this review, the general manager, Jason, called me about my review to apologize and talk with me about what happened. He apologized multiple times for the awkward situation that went down, and while he was not present when it happened, he obviously took my review seriously. He then offered to deliver a free pizza to me himself, and that if I didn't want it this evening, he would bring it any other time. I took him up on his offer and he brought me a pizza.

Being in a manager position myself, I understand sometimes what managers have to go through, and his choice to call me and try to make it right is commendable and I really appreciated it. Sometimes businesses or employees mess up, but what matters is what they do to FIX it. Jason went the extra mile.

Thanks to this, I changed my review to 3 stars. Also, this vegan pizza is amazing as always."
LBAkHJJfCoDj9aa5sc0Mxw,b2Xhc8t3rZPOucE2egJ-Vg,1,"WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? My soul is crushed. I don't know what changed but now it's no better than a McDonald's. They used to have organic burgers and like mushrooms and avocado as toppings...now the burgers are the flattest burgers I have ever seen (literally less than a pancake...I've never seen anything like it, actually) and the taste is bleh and they don't have sweet potato fries anymore....is this even a real Steak N Shake?? So upsetting. In fact McDonald's is probably better. Never going here again."
ltQ-ilKwrlBtub7b_7gKww,G6BFY0FY2-n6tPEDD5_Dcg,3,I so wanted to like this place.  When we went there was no one there.  That is never a good sign for a foodie.  Then the person at the counter acted like we bothered them.  our food was being made and someone took down some regular bread for one of the sandwiches ???  That's why you go to a deli for the bread.  When the food came it was pretty okay but nothing that really sent it over the edge.  I really hope they desire to fix some things cause it has potential but you are in Phoenix the eating out capital of the US.  You have to bring your A game and they did not.

Get the house made chips instead of the fries (better to me).    I esp love the smoked mozzarella with bacon and jalapeno and ranch sauce...get it with everything (picked onions, cucumber, etc)  YUMMY!"

The food was okay but the prices are too high for what it is.  I've had better but I do have to say that they provide Challah bread to most places in the valley and even the the price is high I need my challah bread for french toast!

The burger was cooked perfectly and was so juicy.  The service was really good.  I was impressed.  The only thing I would change are the fries.  I didn't think they matched up in excellence to the burger. (that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars)  Other than that....YUMMY!"

It reminded very much of the subs I would get when I lived in Chicago (take that as a huge compliment).  The sandwich was very large so easy to split unless you have a huge appetite or can't control yourself around yummy food.  I can't wait to go back and try some more there.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is that maybe some fresh made chips would send it to the 5 star rating other than that...yummmmy!"

They even have cookies with your meal.  It's a place you have to try.  If you are into a fancy place this is not for you.  I happen to think good food can come fro some hole in the wall places.

EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.

Actually we were outside on the misted patio with our two dogs. My brother ordered an omelet of the ""Healthy menu"" and I ordered the French Toast off the same menu column. We did the divide and conquer thing so the waitress brought extra plates, but let me just say that is probably the best french toast (or is it freedom toast) I have had in a long time. They encrust it with nuts and granola, and it is insanely good. I think they are sometimes lacking in the service area, but not enough to write a letter to the editor. It was rather busy as we were there on a Saturday AM but we did not wait long to sit."

We were both quite full after the meal but there was nothing terrible remarkable for either of us, my food tasted as if it sat in the window for a while, the eggs were lukewarm, and the potatoes were almost cold to the touch, as was the toast.

If you don't like a hefe, they have dozens and dozens of great beers on tap, and if you dont like those they have a wall of self service coolers where you can pick and drink or mix a six-pack and go. For food my favorite is the artichoke dip and the Thai Chicken Pizza. PRO TIP: they also sell Growlers of tap beer to go, perfect for poolside Orange Blossom at home, but when I get it I ask for an orange to go, as the only way to drink it is with a slice of orange. They brew offsite so don't go expecting a tour, oh and the one complaint I have is the noise in the place can be a bit harsh as they are no soft surfaces to absorb or soften sound. After a meal of speaking loudly to those across the table you can leave a little hoarse.  No patio or dogs here, but smoking out in front."

Everyone who works here is super friendly and makes great menu recommendations. After being seated and given the run down of the days happy hour specials, we selected a number of sushi items. The most important thing about sushi is the fish quality, and i can say I was impressed. Good color/flavor/texture of all the fish meats we ordered. Three glasses of wine and enough sushi to stuff two hungry eaters for $65, pretty standard. I must say I am a bit surprised by the few negative reviews, I am not doubting them, I simply had a totally different and positive experience."

Osha Thai has been our favorite restaurant in the past year! This cozy and family-style restaurant never failed us everytime we dined there. They have very authetic thai food that is comparable to those in Thailand (I grew up with Thai food in Southeast Asia). They have everything from your typical pad thai, seafood somtum (green papaya salad) to gourmet cashew duck. The price is very reasonable with this kind of quality! Service always excellent!"

They usually have fresh and better selection of dim-sum during the weekends and the service is faster. Yes, you might need to wait for a bit but it's worth your money. :) We will definitely go back there for some more dim-sum!"

J and I went there the first time for dinner with Berk, D and Joel last night. Christopher is tucked away at the corner of Biltmore Fashion Mall on Camelback.
After the party arrived, we had a round of drinks at its Crush Lounge. The bar/lounge is trendy with good wine selection! We were seated outside the patio for dinner. It was the best outdoor fine dining experience that I had had in a while (well.. summer just over!) Let's get down to the menu... D strongly recommended Christopher's sweetbread main course. Since we had always wanted to try out sweetbread, we immediately jumped to her recommendation! J ordered the sweetbread too. I had the rack of lamb. B got herself a very generous portion of seared scallops with some green. Joel ordered a plate of burger and fries. Man.. I have to say that Christopher's food is delicious! The lamb was a bit overcooked (I asked for medium-rare) but still had a tender and good taste. J and D's sweetbread was to die-for! Next time when I go back, I would just order the sweetbread (comes with a big bed of stir-fry cabbage) too. We finished our dinner with 2 desserts!

Overall, this restaurant is better than our expectations. We'd definitely go back soon for a great meal. Get the sweetbread! :)"

NxjUiGBNgyDErKXnmQ3s3w,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,5,"If you believe in karma and visited Cartel Monday (3/29) and left your iPod (you know the make and model if you really did)... just ask the barista and they should be holding your mobile jukebox.  I believe in karma and in return from my good deed, I received a 5 star experience coffee experience.

Man, this is a great place to come sit, sip, and vibe.  Tonight I went with the Americano with a Mocha to go for the wife.  Both are stellar drinks and I picked up a bag of the Black Market Espresso to try at home.

As for the sitting, there are a few tables in the front for you to get some one on one time, 2 couches which are fairly comfy and then a lot of cafeteria like arrangements, so if you are a little shy, then grab a cup to go.  I would recommend coming in and feeding off the vibe.  They usually have some form of good music whether it is the speakers or a live DJ.  It is a very industrial feel inside, but the energy is amazing.

It is also one of the best cups of joe I have experienced in the valley (whether drinking in or taking out).  The coffee has bold rich flavors and it is roasted right there onsite.  If you are in during roasting hours, then that just adds to the overall experience.

Overall it is a very hip indie vibe and my new hot spot while the wife is in her night classes.  Man, this is a great place....oh and don't forget to check your pockets for your iPod."
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"Eating vegan felt so bad...but not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good.

Seriously it is really nice to have a vegan option that is just straight comfort food.  The place is never too packed and is super casual.  You walk up and the hardest choice is what to try.  Don't worry you can't go wrong.  Every time we have gone the cashiers have been very helpful if you are still deciding between two options.

For food, I would recommend the BBQ po boy.  It comes with a little kick.  The fries are always good and come with a great ketchup.  I am not a big fan of the thai slaw, so I would definitely go with the fries.  I have also had the pizzas and they are always safe.  The veggie burger is good, but if mushy burgers freak you out, then go another direction.  I do wish is a was a bit more firm.

If you are looking for a ridiculous treat, grab a Soynami on the way out.  My fave is the mint chocolate version.  One small thing that I do hate though is they serve them with wooden spoons and I am a bit weird and HATE eating off a wooden spoon.  Am I weird?  The soynami is so good, I still do it though.

Finally I am happy to have this place in town.  I am always amazed that Phx does not have more dedicated veg/vegan places for as big as it is.  If you are a fan of That's a Wrap, then you will be satisfied here - same ownership.

Another tip - Check out the t-shirts for sale.  I love my ninja deer on a bike shirt!"
vhIJ91MDgUuk4Cr9Kpj1Nw,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"Jimmy Johns is the home of free smells and they are finally in the Phoenix area with 3 stores that I know of - Downtown Tempe on Mill, Rural and Baseline next to Whole Foods and Rural-ish and Ellitot-ish.

They keep it very simple at JJ's using fresh meats, cheeses, and fresh daily bread.  The bread makes the whole sandwich as it is a great mix of crispy outside and chewy inside.

I go for the #6 - Veggie Sub.  It has Fresh (actually red which you don't see at most fast sandwich/sub shops) Tomatoes, Provolone, Cucumbers, Sprouts, Avocado Spread and Helman's Mayo.  That's right they use real mayo, which is a little fatty, but worth the calories at the end of the day.

I like that there is not any fussing over the size of sandwich - either a sub that is plenty big or you can go with a sandwich on wheat bread.

Quick, simple, free smells, and dependable."
NPiLy71qqXzb45k9eQOgCQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,3,"We went Maize's in search of another future favorite in Central/uptown Phoenix.  We love the area and have several favorites in the area, so why not add another?  I am sad to say that did not happen.  Don't get me wrong we had a nice meal and the place is not bad, but it does not hit the mark of a 4 or 5 star place.

If it is nice, then the patio is the spot to be.  We had a short 10 minute wait, so we sat at the bar for a Stella and the bartender was very nice.  We ordered an app while we waited.  The app was a 4 star and we thought this was going to set the stage for the meal to be a 4.  We got the artichoke dip and it is nice that it comes with a mix of chips, crackers, and pita chips.  Very good.

We followed with our meal - my wife went with the caesar and I went with the veggie sandwich.  The fries turned out the be the only thing worth while between both meals.  The salad was a little weird, because it was fairly bland and was served in a weird 1980's wooden bowl.  The veggie sandwich was very bland and forgettable.

Overall the atmosphere and the pleasant day probably helped bring this up to a 3.  The fries and artichoke dip helped, too.  But the main meals were just OK."
jrFB2o5Gk2aRw22oNGxJKg,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,3,"If you are want a sub, but don't want the monotony of your typical sub shops, head to Firehouse Subs and if you want I bet they will let you give  your best firetruck siren impression, too.

This place has the similar feel as any other sub shop, but just replace the cheesy subway scenery wall paper with firehouse artifacts.

The menu provides similar sub options, but the quality of the ingredients are much higher rated than what you would expect to find.  The real add on for me is the hot sauce.  They have a nice variety of different hot sauces that give any sub that extra kick.

The other thing I like is the 8 and 12 inch are really that large.  Seems like everyone now offers a 6 and 12 inch that really are 4 and 8.  Friendly staff and the option to create your own sub and personalize it with some pop make it a solid 3 star."
FcvWRrwhjIqktji6iLpaUA,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,3,"Coach and Willies is always a good place to go before a game.  That is the only time I have gone.  The bar is pretty cool and is setup with nice TVs and I love the dark wood accents.  If it is nice out, then the patio is the place to be.

The food is pretty good.  The artichoke dip is our favorite item on the menu.  If you are feeling a pizza, but can't make up your mind the pinwheel pizza mixes up 4 choices, so that is always good.

Again, I would consider this a great option before a game, especially because of the atmosphere mixed with pretty good food.  I have never found myself thinking about going here outside of a game day, so I have to stick with the 3 star rating."
Mul_BVwcnhqmp2h_7QFepQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"Very hip pizza and wine bar on Mill Ave. If you are looking for a grown up, but hip place in the heart of Mill, then this is the place. This place has a great patio area that is nice and typically far enough away from the Mill Kids/Bums, so you can enjoy a nice AZ day or evening without being asked for change. Inside is very hip and at night it has a very hip, chic, romantic, true wine bar feel to it. I like to sit inside or out.

The food is very dependable and there are many options. The Farmer's Salad comes highly recommended from my wife, but the last two times they have run out of peaches. It is light, but packs nice flavor. We never get too upset when someone runs out of a seasonal product (i.e. peaches), because it gives us comfort that they use fresh ingredients. I'd recommend you go with a Pizza and Salad or Pizza and Bruschetta. The bruschetta is very solid and they use nice oils and seasonal veggies and great basil.  You have a couple of good bruschetta options (something that I am not sure why more places do not offer).  It is not quite as good as Postino bruschetta, but pretty darn close. The pizzas are the same the margherita is a safe, but solid choice. Again they use nice good ingredients and the oil is great. The crust is nice and thin and crispy with the right balance of chewy.

I highly recommend you pair any meal with a glass of wine, but if you are going to enjoy a full evening and truly embrace the ambiance, settle in with a bottle. Another tip Sundays and Mondays are half price bottle bringing the prices back down to want we'd pay at a wine shop."
oM_iooopkwnS7XnVS5kqlQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,2,"This is definitely a Meh rating.  If I did not work near, then I would never imagine going, as it does look a little sketchy from the outside.

The food itself is just ok at best to me.  Don't expect any salads to knock your socks off as this is not their speciality.  They have decent thick cut fries, but not the best.  They can sometimes be overly soggy.  Most of the folks that like a greasy gyro would dig this place, but I think it lacks full flavor and other options outside of gyros - which I do realize is hard to do when you have the word Gyros in your name.

If you have more time, there are other places within 5 minutes that for the same cost are worth going to and passing over this place."
Wnq5to0-jXyh0-_jRZ6VOQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,3,"If you are looking for a chain that does not feel like a chain, then you might enjoy this place.  The decor is pretty nice and has a modern upscale casual feel.  They have a lot of seating, so even if there is a wait, it really should not be too bad.

The food is slightly above average.  I would say this is a safe place to bring out of towners or a business lunch, but it is not on my list of favorites.  The cornbread is a great addition to the meal and most of the mixed drinks are good.  The food is good, but nothing on the menu seems to be too memorable.

Again a safe nice place if you are looking for an americanized mexican restaurant.  It has a fairly upscale casual touch to the decor.  Usually any Z is located nearly a shopping district, so I could see this as a good place to go on a shopping day or for some drinks."
0ZL9snCMfzb9icU3LS_kKw,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,3,"Lots of PBCs all over the valley and the Denver airport and a few other cities we travel.  Paradise still has one of the better and dependable chocolate chip cookie regardless of location.

The foods can be hit or miss.  A lot of time we get the SW Caesar without chicken and chicken ends up in there and we have to go back and re-ask for no chicken.  The tomato soup is pretty dependable and the breakfast is good.  I like that you get quite a few options for bread, but I wish they had a few more sandwich choices for vegetarians.  I always think a place like this could just add a grilled cheese to the menu, but I have not seen one.

Usually most of the PBC's and this Chandler one especially have plenty of seating for groups and even have a few nook/coffee style areas with leather comfy chairs.  The cookies are always dependable and the carrot cake is very good.  I would give this a solid 3 as it is quick and they use good ingredients and typically friendly.  There is a slight difference between the full restaurants and the mall or airport versions, so if you have the option, go to the full restaurant."
D3dAx-QW_uuClz4MambeHA,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"Great grocer and lunch spot. The only drawback is parking. If you can beat the noon hour parking is not bad. There is a lot on the north side of Campbell that usually has spots.

On to the food. If the summer rolls are in the cold case, then they are a must.  The veggie burger is very good - a little mushy, but great flavor and a killer bun. If you are splurging, add on fries.  The Tammie Coe sweets are always sure to satisfy. My personal favorite is the red velvet cake and my wife loves the brownie fingers. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with anything with their signature English muffins and they have great coffee.

Pizzas are a must, but I've reviewed under the LGO Pizzeria page.

The grocery store itself has neat gifts and gadgets for the kitchen and sometimes the office. Stroll around while you wait for your food."
7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"One of my favorite spots in Phx. Parking can be frustrating, so the weekends you should consider valet.

All the salads are solid and for pizza, I'd recommend the Avocado Pizza. It is a spin on the standard margherita adding a splash of a freshly squeezed lemon and then topped off with a fresh sliced avocado. For the record, LGO buys the best avocados I've tasted.

Another tip buy your bottle of wine in the attached grocery side of LGO for no cork fee and prices aren't bad for bottled wine.

Great casual upscale dining atmosphere. Jeans, t-shirt, and great food."
0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"The Herb Box is a little hard to find for first timers, but worth your effort to get there.  You have to turn up a street that looks like you are going to a residential area before you get there and then it is tucked into a strip mall.  The Herb Box offers a wide range menu with a good selection of grab and go dinners/lunches in the cold case in the bar/pick up side of the restaurant.  They actually have two suites that are side by side that offer sit down and pickup.

If you are getting To Go or Pickup orders, they do a nice job of using good quality boxes that keep the food protected and warm.  They also will sell their salad dressings (vinagarette = yum) in nice glass take home bottles.

I highly recommend the Butternut Squash Enchiladas.  They are little more pricey than everything else on the menu and lack a true side, but they are very rich in flavor and have a very pleasant spicy taste that trailers the sweetness the butternut squash offers.  They are also cooked to perfection leaving the cheese nicely melted and crisping up the shell without it becoming soggy.

They offer a nice variety of salads and side options.  Another few notes, the mac n' cheese in the To Go case is a good reheat item to take home for a side or late night snack or powerful enough for a dinner.  The vinegarette  goes great with an orzo pasta and feta cheese.  The take home baked goods are very tasty.

Cozy little cafe style feel at The Herb Box and a simple menu with big flavor give this a 4 star rating!"
RyJIi1IP0UQ5qGbwazgsIA,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,2,"Aunt Chilada's s simply put, just OK.  They have a pretty big menu, but I don't know that I would say they have a speciality.  The nice thing about AC's is that they have a big patio area and they are great for larger groups.  So if you are looking to sneak away for a long lunch in the sun on a spring day or if you have your office lunch (we take our new hires here) and need the space, then come here.

Now, if you are looking for some great full flavored Mexican, then keep on looking.  The chips and salsa are good here and after that, everything kind of blends in as the typical mexican."
J07TDs6qnTIaxm48EL1cKQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,3,"Hula fits into the cool vibe of uptown Phoenix.  I really like the vibe of the area and Hula seems to be a good fit.  If you can and it is not June and 176 degrees, get a good seat outside and enjoy.  Inside is a very modern tiki style (not sure, but I think I just made up a new style, but I think it fits this place).

Overall our experience was pretty good.  They have one of the best veggie burgers in Phx.  The sweet potato fries are a nice touch to any meal on the list.  The mai tai was very good and made me wish I was in Maui!

The only issue we had was minor.  Our waiter did bring us pork and before we could get the right meal he was off and I had to track him down and it took a bit to get it fixed.  That happens time to time and I will not let that cloud my judgement of the place - it is still fitting as a 3 star.

I like the area and the busy atmosphere is great on a Friday or Saturday night.  We will be back, especially for another Veggie Burger!"

Great choice.  I am not a huge chai fan and I will definitely be getting another in the near future.  Very good.

Very pleasant atomosphere and the customer service was very welcoming.  I decided to sit and work a little and enjoyed my chai so much that I ordered a latte to go.  Excited to try this one, but wanted to update my Yelp before I hit the road."
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"Very cool place. You can easily drive right past The Parlor and never know what you are missing out on. I worked in the area for nearly 2 years and never knew about the Parlor until my office relocated and a friend recommended it to me and I would consider me and my wife foodies. The decor is what I would consider a mix of modern and industrial and it is very upscale casual.

The food is very good . I have tried a few pizzas and I love the fungi pizza so far. It has rich flavors and if you like thin crust, wood burning stove ""fancy"" pizzas then this will hit the spot. Don't be intimidated by the look of the fungi (which if you order it, you must like mushrooms). They use nice oils and don't overtake any flavors with too much cheese.

Salads are very solid choices. I have also had the risotto and would give it a 4 rating. It is very good and rich. Our favorite app or side dish is the cauliflower gratin. This is a cheesy baked cauliflower topped with nice bread crumbs heaven. They have a fairly good wine list to choose from to pair with about anything on the menu.

Overall the service has always been great. They are typically busy, but I would say any wait is worth it. They have 3 different areas for seating. If it is a nice day, the outside patio is nice and they also have the windows open in the bar area seating. The third area is the main seating area and they have a large space in the back they can put together for groups.

If you are looking for a nice business sit down casual lunch, nice Saturday lunch or a solid upscale casual dining in the area, I would definitely recommend you add this to your list and keep your eyes open, because it is very easy to drive right past."
BgthHqiXot2s4Sd_xcI6DQ,ueCYs_wHuQ7B6_QuWIiBow,4,"Pita Jungle is the Pound for Pound champion of the city.  PJ packs the best food for dollar quality and quantity I know of in Phoenix.  Not only is it a great place with a lot of options, but it is inexpensive.  We ate there today and shared the hummus, got a cup of soup and the thousand bean hot pita and an iced tea at it was only $18.  That is great for any sit down, but even a better deal because the food is awesome.

The Hummus is great.  Two tips - 1. ask for a mix of all 3 flavors (same price and you get a chance to try all three) and 2. Ask for an extra pita (no extra cost) - not sure why you only get one to start since you can barely finish the plate with 2 pitas.

If you are in the mood for soup, I recommend the red lentil soup.  It is thick and go with the cup of soup vs. the bowl.  The cup is about as big as a full bowl anywhere else.  The soup has just the right texture and full of flavor and my wife simply calls it ""goodness.""

Salads are always a great choice and don't worry, you get a plate overflowing with food, too.  I also go with the Thousand Bean Hot Pita.  I seriously think it comes with a full 1000 beans over a bread of brown rice on a pita - very good and half the plate will fill you up.

The only downer is that the place is pretty small and the parking lot is shared by other busy places, so at lunch you have to be a parking lot stalker to find a seat.  It is worth the wait if there is one, but they pack their food in nice to go boxes, so take out is also a solid option."

Lady fixing our bowls couldn't even speak English, got our orders wrong and after being given less than the normal serving size on our bowls, including the guac we pay extra for, Sally the cashier or manager, argued with us loudly regarding the portion sizes.  She said ""I could stand here and argue about his with you all day""!  Wow!  We were appalled!  Bathrooms and restaurant floors a complete disaster.  Place was a mess and Sally does not belong in customer service.  We are huge chipotle fans and we were treated with a completely unprofessional attitude.  Sure hope Chipotle reads these reviews.

MY usual Pho place was closed and I needed Pho to help me recover from the night before... So here I went with my kids.  Walking in was pleasant We got greeted, seated, and menus in hand.  I didn't like that they did not give my son a menu, he can read his 13.  Anyways we started out with the egg rolls and I got  Pho with meat and  my son got the chicken breast with rice and a child's pho for my little girl.  When the egg rolls came I was like WTH really iceberg lettuce to wrap my egg rolls : ( . Not impressed . Then it took awhile for our soups and entree to come out and when it arrived... DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Now everybody should  know that the broth is what matters and it tasted like chicken/beef broth, the beansprouts and basil looked sad.  The basil looked like it was picked over. My sons chicken didn't look like a chicken breast.  It looked like they took half of the breast and half it again then smash it flat.  it was too sweet and uneatable. The service is good and the food is Phogettable."
DV-tubtrEPacLsTms4CgZA,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,5,"Great place to get gyros!!! It's a small place about 5 tables inside and cozy.  Our second time here and we left full and happy.  I got the gyro sandwich combo with the greek salad ($1) more but it's worth it.  My yobo got the gyro with the fries and my Jazzy got the jr version of the sandwich.  We tried the dolmas (veg) stuff grape leaves.  It was just ok, but not for me. I'm gonna be returning and try other things. See ya soon."
9NrRvbS29aAav-BuOShRZA,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,1,Wanted to try some spicy chicken and I was every disappointed. The place was clean but the food was nothing to come back for. We got the 8 piece family meal with the biscuits and mash potatoes and an large mac and cheese.  I taste no spices or flavor in that chicken. You really don't get your money's worth and I will NOT be back.  We even had 2 pieces of chicken left and did not bring it home. That says it all!!!
FbMZ0N5iAicep5ssYLZB9w,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,1,So decide to try this place on a whim and boy was it the biggest mistake of the day.  Walk in around  lunch time and  was greeted and seated right away.  My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and I got the sweet and sour chicken.  The lunch specials come with the following egg drop soup / iceberg lettuce w/ ranch / an over cooked bland egg roll / cream cheese puff / brown white rice ( its supposed to be fried rice) and then the main dish.  Its a lot of food for $4.95 but its gross.  The orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken had so much breading that you really didn't know if it really  was chicken.  My daughter had to use the bathroom and it was dirty and we saw a roach on its back alive.  Also the lights are so dim in there that its hard to see.  Maybe they did that on purpose.  I would NEVER go back here again... Don't waste your money..... Panda's would have been a BETTER choice.  I left hungry and disappointed...
4E0sK671C98JW8nakFbUnQ,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,5,"WOW!!!  Awesome food. We drove all the way from East Mesa for the sweet tea. We came in on Saturday for lunch. I got the Cobb salad with the apple cider dressing and it was Awesome!!!  It was actually packed and not fluff to look full. The sandwiches, nuggets and of the tea was YUMMY!! Yumm yumm."
Ly2ShApiomYZwKehwb7eRA,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,4,"I really love this place. This is my second visit for lunch and man this place gets packed. The first time we beat the rush so the service was a little better. We sat at the counter  both times which is better during lunch if there are 2 in your party. It seems like you get your sushi faster.  We got a wash cloth the first time but not our second visit. I think it was too busy.  So far we have ordered the spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, unagi, tobiko, and soft shell crab (spider roll)  that's what they call it. The only item I didn't really like is the spider roll, I have tasted better.  I wish I live closer to here but I don't."
D4BWyStFZzA7k8hqDmnyFw,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,4,"Mmmmmm found this gem by mistake and it was pretty awesome. We had the mandoo, spicy pork belly, and spicy squid. Man it was soooooo good. The ban chan was ok. I didn't like the bean sprouts it smell like bleach.  The water tasted good. It seem filtered not like just from the tap.

The only think I would like to change is have lettuce wraps and lunch deals other then the specials of the day. We tried to order but our server didn't really know what we were talking about. And he comes and tells out they are out of lettuce. ; (.   I will definitely be back to try more dishes.........."
vMnB2Cz3c1Io1IEyeLLVOA,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,3,This is a cute little restaurant.   The menu cover is cool its engraved wood.  I got the chicken satay to start with.  My daughter liked that.  I wanted to try the Pad Thai (chicken) and yellow curry (spicy) also chicken.  I  love the Thai ice tea... I didn't like the pad Thai because the noodles were mushy and it tasted like vinegar.  Yuck... The chicken curry was good I asked for spicy but it wasn't.. The service was good..
QZJpXx1TbOXqzLx6u6xmaQ,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,1,"Well I was wanting to feel like I was back home but was sadly disappointed.  First like Juli said in her review the two ladies are not very friendly they barely acknowledge you. There is no Aloha at Paradise. .  The utensils are so cheap that it will not cut anything.  We got the paradise special, kim chee soup, 2 Hawaiian Sun drinks, and 2 spam musubi  and my total was about 28$. The musubi was the best thing I ate there.  After 15 minutes my stomach wasn't happy.  ( you know what I mean)  Would I be back..... NO not worth the drive and hassle..... My search is still ongoing to find taste of home."
QD1cjsSFtktPNtUDJWb--Q,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,4,"I've been coming here for years and I can't believe I never done a review. Anyways this is my go to Pho place. The service is speedy fast (almost too fast) and the pho will help you with what's ailing you. You must get the egg roll, it's soooo good. I want to try other things but I can't cause I gotta pho (it's that good)."
ShYv4mmgNwrStaFnje3uZQ,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,3,"I'm always excited to try a new restaurant that serves pho since my favorite place is no longer in business. I enjoyed the pho and appetizers but dinner was on the expensive side. The menu stated that happy hour was until 3 to 7 PM but the server told me it ended at 6 PM. The pho was good just wished there were more broth and noodles.  This place was upscale from other pho places, decorated nice and the food was presented nicely but I guess I rather have awesome food at a reasonable price. So I'm still on a search for the perfect place......"
9njwmO6YzhaQB3-htNMFYQ,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,1,"I was looking forward to checking out this place BUT I was VERY disappointed.... Went  on a Friday night with the family, the place was busy in the bar part of the restaurant.  Had to wait awhile before we were acknowledge and the girl server when asked about the beer selections did not know what they had at the bar.... We ordered the honey hot wings extra crispy which was the best thing of the meal.  It came with a side of ranch and two celery stalks. (see Picture) LOL .. I got a cheeseburger w/ bacon ( see Picture) and my son got  a hamburger w/ bacon. The burgers were bland and it came with SALTY fries.  My boyfriend got the pastrami.  Pastrami is salted when cured and added salt makes it very Salty.  It came to our table very SALTY.  Tried the cheese pizza from the kids menu for my 4 year old and it was bland and looked messy.  The cook added to much salt to our meal in the fries and sandwich.  The burgers had no flavor and  I will NOT be going back... Its not worth the price and irritation of a BAD meal.  The whiskey sour he had was also very weak for the price. Although the restaurant was clean and it look very nice in its renovated state that's the only reason it got a star."
HhopVWTjghrRU2sWGBv-Rg,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,1,This has gone thru some changes last time I've been here. Now you get metal silver ware and real plates but some how the food got worse. I got the # 7 green chili burro with rice and beans and a child's cheese crisp and my food was kinda gross!! The flour tortilla was not warm nor hot and the green chili looks like dog food.  The food is NOT good. Taco Bell is better than this place.
d7ozMWbBwcFOkHM3zmktfA,Rn7viGzWBoUUirMI36Zyyw,1,Ok I used a Groupon and tried this place but totally not worth it.... We left HUNGRY after spending $40. Who leaves a restaurant hungry.  You know something's wrong if your doing that.  This is totally not like Genki's. Only 3 little skinny rolls are on a plate for spicy tuna for $2 and not spicy at all. I asked for tea thinking its green tea but I got a Lipton black tea bag. ( isn't this a Asian restaurant ) they should have green tea. So any way if you are a very lite eater or a child this place is perfect for you. The sushi guys don't interact with you at all even though we were sitting at the sushi bar ( if you can call it that ).
len2nrEtgD9bjnoYSyLPjA,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,3,"I am a falafel-holic. It's the strangest thing. That being said, we have lived just down the street from Saba's for 5 years now and it wasn't until maybe a month or so ago that we finally decided to try it out with some friends. It was ok. It's one of those places that if I'm out running errands with no time to cook and I don't want to get out of my yoga clothes to go to a resturant, I'll call ahead and pick up. And, we will probably take family and friends there for a casual lunch or dinner. The portions are large for the price and the staff is nice and friendly. I like a place where you can go and ask for suggestions and the staff has actually tried all the dishes. Again, I am a strictly falafel pita person myself and it is good by me!

I do wish it was maybe open a little later. Sometimes this mama and daddy settle for late dinners due to the little one and there have been times when after 9 I just want to run across the street. But, oh well!"
8_BPq3eJlhOLMPuutk6zQg,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"Hoping to grab a quick breakfast meal before running errands this morning, all of our usual breakfast joints were packed and we just happen to stumble on Dilly's being open for breakfast. They had a little breakfast selection as my husband got the breakfast burrito and I decided to go for the veggie sandwich. My sandwich was awesome! It was nice to have a sandwich that sort of mixed up the norm. Lovely blend of sprouts, tomatos, lettuce, cream cheese (I'm trying to go vegan, but the cream cheese was a wonderful compliment) on fresh multi-grain bread. Add with it the fruit salad and it was a very filling breakfast.

I'll go back for sure. Although, I liked it for a sandwich place, it's not going to be a place I crave, but the next time I stop in I'm sure I will still like what I order."
iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"I recently hosted an alumni event here and they did a wonderful job of accommodaing us! Katie, the manager, was very helpful even though it was pretty busy.  A lot of televisons makes it great to go and watch games. A very nice bar area, however, I do wish they had more beer selections. Kid friendly, too, which is key. Great place to host an event. Hoping we go there every week!"
_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"After living in Chicago, I know what good pizza is, so I'm a picky pizza person (try saying that 3 times fast). But, I do go here for the pasta. I get cravings for the Bolla Pasta with meat sause. It is so good! I also like to go there during the day for their wings. I think its just their atomosphere. Yes, the wait can be a little long, but if you are around and hungry at a random time ( like yesterday we went at 3:30) then you are seated right away. The staff is super nice and they really like their jobs so you aren't getting grumpy servers who you feel you have to tip. Our parents like to go here when they visit for the food and music.

Haven't tried the cookie dessert yet, but I'm almost there!"
eJ-bDf7E1ph07vF7WbF8dA,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"Our little family went here for lunch on a Sunday. We go there before the lunch crowd and we were totally digging the scenery. We sat in the closed in patio over looking the golf course. My husband has played the course a few times which started a conversation about moving to a golf course. That's another story...

We went hoping for a brunch, but all the items on the menu (even weekends) are lunch/dinner items. However, the special for the day was bananas foster waffles. We both go that and, oh my goodness, was it good!!!  I didn't eat again until late that night and it put us both in a food coma. The orange syurp was amazing and everything went so well together!

The downfall was our mimosas were about the same price as our entrees, so our total bill was $60 for breakfast. However, I do get to go back in a couple of weeks for a reception with some fellow alumni, so I am happy to know I will be trying other foods there also!"
7pGWy3mR7gjMSE6x2njqPA,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"Met some friends here after a trip to the library and this was the first time I had been there. They have a great selection of entrees, both lunch and breakfast. Loved the uniqueness of the food selections. Interesting combos!  The sandwiches are huge and filling, so if you do not get a side to go along, the sandwich alone does the trick! We sat inside and bought along 3 babies, so it was kinds tight with the strollers, car seats. They don't have high chairs, so our next visit will probably be outdoor seating. But, hey, when a place offers outdoor seating here in the Valley..TAKE IT! I'll be going back!"
8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,5,"Ohh la la! This place made me want to learn French. I went there with my bro and sis- in laws as well as my mother in law and my husband. We each brought in our own bottle of wine. I love BYOBs because you can really splurge on your food AND drink delicious wines. This place did the trick! We had the Interested Cheeses (my sis-in-law and I love cheese) and the Filet Mignon taco for starters. I can't vouch for the tacos, but I think my husband would have fought me for it.

For our entrees I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection! I even ended up eating off other plates with salmon after they were full I loved it so much! My husband loved the Filet Mignon as well. I do think it was here where he discovered he really did like salmon.

Of course, we had to have dessert, too! We got the chocolate mocha and the four berry tartes. Even if you are full, get a tarte to go!

I really want to go back to try the farfalle..Maybe this weekend??

I guess it is good for groups but call ahead. Its a tight squeeze!"
ErHMVkPstNyefb3ZU_z1Cw,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,2,"Ok, I just had lunch there. The place is clean and the staff is friendly, but most of all, I am paying for my food, right?

Maybe I've been spoiled by the Pear Gorganzola salad at the one on Tatum, but I wasn't pleased with my pizza/salad combo today at this one.

The garden salad was actually a lettuce salad with two tomatoes. It was weak. The pizza wasn't as organic tasting as I had hoped for. I was hoping for that fresh taste, but I got a Dominos taste. Disappointed. Maybe I should just stick to the Pear Gorganzola salad. Infact, I am craving that now!"
st_pnALlGB6OCWkb4e14mg,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"Ok, my review is for their lunch only because I used to go there quite a bit for their lunch specials. Its ideal if you want to get good food for a good price on your lunch break. Their Mr. Pinks pasta and salad combo is just the right amount for lunch. The wedge salad is great if you are looking for something on the lighter side. Sitting inside or outside is great and you will probably hear a little Frank Sinatra before heading back to work. The staff is very nice, friendly, and quick!"
OtGSQQzV7uF8XPAsNIh7Bw,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"--Only vouching for the breakfast!--

I like to take friends in town here for brunch because most of my friends visit from Chicago and its nice to take them to the mountain and sit and enjoy the view. Its a peaceful way to have breakfast and its not too bad of a price. Two of my favorite entrees are the bagel and lox and the oh so dreamy banana chocolate beglein waffles. My friend and I liked the waffles so much that we tried to recreate them the next day. It didn't work as well as we thought it would.

If there are only two of you going, definately call ahead and see if you can get a booth facing the window. Its breathtaking!"
lw5O3g9hl41l9fKLkmvJGA,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,2,"I went here for a meeting a few weeks ago and from the moment I got there, I could tell the staff wanted to be anywhere but at work that morning. Maybe it was also the company I was there with, but I felt like I should be about 80 to enjoy. Not that there is anything wrong with being 80, but I don't need to feel that way, yet! I ordered a Cesear salad because there's not a lot of vegetarian dishes. It was blah. Nothing to write home about. Like others have said, I got out of there paying $20, but I got a sad salad and a diet coke. It's on a lake, cute, but it's not a place I will go back to."
fseN-tYwcbjtYm7DjjEjLw,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,1,"Ok, I wasn't expecting a lot when my husband and I wanted something quick to eat and a little different and our usual Rubios, but I should have trekked a little further to Pei Wei.

I was craving pad thai and I knew this place had it, so I order that with no meat. I then asked if I could have tofu instead. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted the tofu deep fried. I said no and my husband ordered two egg rolls. The total was $19! I knew that was off, so when I mentioned it, he said that the tofu was a brick of tofu. I told him I didn't need a whole block of tofu, just some to put in my pad thai. He then said he couldn't do that? What?? You can sell whole blocks of it, but you can't put it in my food? I said no to the tofu and waited for our food.

After we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!"
9Q9nXYkov-tCTOEhWJTgSg,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,3,"Been here on a few occassions. Different times of the day, different reasons, so here it goes...

For food: They actually serve breakfast, too, so its open all day. The portions are huge, however, i only had maybe 3 bites of it all (omlet, potatoes, something else I can't remember) and I threw it away. Too greasy. It was so greasy and gross that it left grease stains everywhere. Ew!

Nightlife: The place gets packed pretty quick and since they have valet its nice to leave your car there overnight. If there is one thing, they don't recommend driving drunk. Good for them!!

An event: Ok, here is where I give them props. We organized a fundraiser there for work and they were excellent to work with regarding that! They did a bull riding contest, had 2 for 1 drink specials, and the management there was so nice to do whatever they could to help us out!

Too bad, I can't give it higher than a 3 though. I just can't get pass the food."
F-PmkzyN80fVcNMN8Z2aiw,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"Z'Tejas is one of those places (for me, at least) that I totally forget about until someone says ""hey, what about going to Z'Tejeas?"" Then, I remember ""ohhh the margaritas!!:

This past Saturday night, this is just what happened! Living only a mile from the Phoenix Open, there wasn't a place around with less than a 90 minute wait and some friends and I were starving. One friend reminded us of Z's and they got us in for a table of 7 quickly. No apps were needed as we devoured the cornbread. Even my little baby boy gobbled some up, too!

I got the wild mushroom enchailada and a pomogrante margarita. DE-LISH! I devoured it all! Then, I ordered margarita numbero dos. For someone who doesn't consume a lot of alcohol, I became Miss Chatty Cathy. But, I like this place a lot. There can be a lot of people there, but you don't feel crowded because the seating is nicely spaced. I've even sat at the bar seating before and never felt like anyone was in my personal space.

Now, I have just got to remember to think of it when going to dinner."
LKeKUAHG-efbhckXsV8iKw,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,4,"After moving where a Starbucks isn't in walking distance, we found Matador's Coffee that is close enough for a Sunday stroll. It's nice and cozy and had a lot of things to choose from for breakfast, brunch or lunch! I've been trying out different iced lattes and coffees and all have been great! The sandwiches are made after you order so nothing is just put in a microwave. The pasta salad is great, too!! My husband ordered it once and I ended up devouring it. Nice sized portions. Has both indoor and outdoor seating, which is great because I don't like to leave my little pooch at home!"
2FfZUyA82YhQCjWNiqDCzQ,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,5,"Due to this pregnancy, I've given up my vegetarian ways so this baby can have some extra protein! I should have known as soon as I was craving cheeseburgers, he was a boy!

I work about two blocks from here and some co-workers decided to go here for lunch one day. Cheeseburgers and milkshakes? Count me in!

I love this place! Very 50-ish with the counter and barstools. The cheeseburgers are to die for! I mean it! And they give you a heaping of fries! They also have sweet tea here, which is a bonus for me. The orders are so quick! Granted, you do come out feeling as if you can't eat again for days, but it is so worth it! Good thing there isn't one by my house or else, I would eat there more often than I do!

Definately recommend!"
nXKaLgLuLs2-S8_O-V09-A,Y50kArMlDzCvLv6CnWN8Ww,5,"We stopped in here today while out running errands all over town. We weren't all that hungry, but I've been wanting to go here for awhile and really didn't know when I would be near here again. My husband was game for going. This place is like it should belong on a beach somewhere. It's small...no tables, just barstools, maybe 8 total with a few tables outside. I'm a vegetarian so I went with the Veggie Sandwich. My husband did the bacon cheddar hot dog. Of course, we did the meal deal. $5..can't beat it!

My sandwich was so good!! I was thinking it would be a veggie burger or something similar, but it was eggplant with sauteed mushrooms and onions. I have no idea what everything was sauteed in, but it was amazing! Had a sweet taste to it. My husband said he could taste the charbroiledness in the hotdog and it was loaded with bacon and cheddar!

The place is just a cool place all around. Good food and good prices, you just can't beat it. I like places are just a little different than the rest and this place is just that!  So, maybe I will be running errands on that side of town more often.

I'm giving it 5 stars, just because it was above and beyond what I expected."
O_cvS8uAocco3R3Pg9np-g,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,3,"REALLY want to love this place but the service is just so so so slow and absent. Also the square plates that they use ""rattles"" on the table - super annoying. As for food, most are full of flavors, especially of the basil. That can be a hit and miss depending on what you order. For example, the yellow curry is so tasty but not green. Looking forward to a better service in the future."
aiX_WP7NKPTdF9CfI-M-wg,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,4,"I go there for food and not really for the *fun* so I may not be experiencing the best of this place, but it still earns my 4 stars.

Slightly better than Dozo's, broth is better than Tampopo's, but Tampopo is the clear winner for the noodles themselves. Our waitress were unable to pronounce the Japanese menu items correctly, and that is such a shame."
xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,4,"Pretty good! It is more of a diner than a restaurant, and actually that is what it is supposed to be...they offer those great Taiwanese diner foods here.

We live close by and we were skeptical when we found out there was to be yet another Poke place off Ray between 10 and 101. Well I was wrong! This is a lovely place. Everything is clean, food is fresh and light (not heavy on sauce or seasonings which I liked), portion isn't too crazy, nice employees....The list goes on and on. Nothing too fancy or too crazy on add-ons, which actually keeps this place very authentic. We will be back."

SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,3,"After hearing many great reviews from friends, I finally visited and had a dinner. Really wanted to love this place but it did not meet my expectation. Cute, nice, and comfy atmosphere (outdoor dining was GREAT), but service was painfully slow, super polite on the surface but the actual level of service, especially the attentiveness, was average at best. Food was hit and miss, too...Here is our group's collective review/impression. Special (fish) and Braised pork belly was way too salty, and the coffee flavored creme brûlée was more like a sugar-loaded pudding with a thick crust of sugar on top. Special dessert (some cake with nuts?) was great. Foie Gras was OK. Lamb and steak were good. I may come back but not with the excitement that we had prior to this dining experience. Not for special occasions for sure..."
wZukjLaf1V2dLRQap_Zriw,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,5,"Nothing crazy fancy but that is the beauty of this place because everything is so, so good! So good that it definitely deserves my 5 star review! Clean, hip, and friendly atmosphere also."
n1AWiP49A5ROroNnbtm0ow,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,3,"Nothing really special other than loads of bacons, nothing's really terrible either. I'd consider as an less carb -loaded version of places like Crackers. Things are on the $ side also."
a19a59qthJCAGBVGozRvmw,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,5,4.5 Stars but giving 5 as I'd like to see this business to stay. This particular location of this strip mall has had businesses come and go too often too much. This Los Taquitos offers fresh yummy food with very reasonable price. The decor is cute and it is clean. We (4 of us) all loved our street tacos. Everything tasted fresh and clean.
Lz6QUlFkVKtnzSISk0WUPw,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,4,"The location and the look from the outside make you rather skeptical about this place, but oh boy, the seafood here is great!! Trifecta sauce FTW. Will come back often!"
6We2O5X62J_gduXU7jvf8w,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,5,"This place has gotten better over time actually! Of course it us known for its pizzas and they became better, especially the crust. Pastas are good enough, and salads are clean and fresh. The red sauce, in fact, on the sweet side so you need to keep that in mind (you can try the pesto ones to stay away the sweetness, for example)."
4s_cPDS_AkLP1fXMJPqB2w,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,3,Meh. Nothing is wrong but nothing is special. OK for a group lunch but not a dinner place for me.
lkpoSg7xf60BsrOjdm0CBA,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,4,"Happy that Bosa is now in Ahwatukee, too:) but the quality of the donuts do vary compared to the ones at other locations."
5lZpyuWjC7L9uJfLfqIQ_w,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,5,"I think Hachi is the winner of ramen joins in the valley. It is the most authentic one and the service is always good. Love the fact that the noddles are different based on your broth, too. The location is a bit weird (at a plaza where most are there for a Home Depot) and some may not find the trip worthwhile, but if you are in the area this us the place."
7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,2,"My son went for lunch yesterday and became sick by dinner time...he said the food was great, though, so that's too bad."
Zt4ljpwfmBufatNM1zPNcQ,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,4,"While the service was on the slow side, the food was flavorful -  strong but not overpowering or salty, which I liked a lot. Will be back."
ILHR4Kifn65EDM9f_OzwjA,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,2,"Why all these great reviews? Been there 3 times in the past 12 months and the food is mediocre at best. At my last visit, my shawarma was dry and salty, too salty that I could only eat half of it with pitas. By 1pm they ran out of rice as my friend asked for it. The owner tries to be ""friendly"" but ends up making inappropriate comments to customers."
CMCAZVvZlP0ztWo6fhwnGg,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,5,"Personally I think this is/is going to be a better location than one on Ray. Staff was more professional and courteous, all the samples were fresh (so moist!!) and tasty, and our purchase from the bakery was so good. Haven't tried the deli food yet but at a glance they looked good, too. Will return soon and hoping that I will be a regular."
-1UMR00eXtwaeh59pEiDjA,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,1,"TERRIBLE. Ordered a waffle to go, was told ""couple of minutes"", ended up waiting for over 20 minutes, and waffle was burnt. Forgot my coffee, too. Never ever will return."
DEeGnshpgUOIOjhq_dd5Ug,yJK9FrIgKWJ13Lc_TU2pQQ,4,"I REALLY want to love this place but the service is so painfully slow whenever we go (doesn't matter when - weekdays/Saturday, lunch/dinner...just SLOW). Like some fellow Yelpers have pointed out this is a Chinese/Taiwanese owned Japanese Tapas-like place. Overall the quality of the food is good as long as you can close one eye and forget about the authenticity of the food. Consider it as a Japanese-Taiwanese fusion diner then you are fine. Sushi is a *meh* for me, Yakitori and other skewer items are OK, Ramen depends on the kind of broth that you order (Tonkotsu  and  Shio are better than the others) but the noodle itself that they use tends to be salty. Since the place is new and the staff is super nice, I shall wait and see how this place can mature and evolve into a more established place to go in coming months. 3.5 Stars."
kcF-en40P3J9L8nLy5lKqQ,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,3,"Been for happy hour and Sunday brunch.  Had a very respectable bruschetta the first and a yummy eggs benedict the second.  While everything was good, nothing really stood out and it was just a little stuffy for my taste.

A sweet outdoor patio and open windows make for a very inviting, comfortable atmosphere, and the service was excellent each time.  If you're in the area, it's worth a try."
bjrPt4DN1r4HpiR0Y8ofvg,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,4,"This place has everything needed to be a hit.  The espresso is delicious, the sandwiches are homemade, yummy and reasonably priced, the staff is friendly and the environment comfortable.  It's also open until 10 which is nice for those of us who find ourselves tied to desks until 5 or 6.  And bonus - I was visited by one of the owners who sincerely asked if everything was as good as it could be.  Nice touch.

Their web site and social media presence seems to need some help but as they've only been open for 5 months it's understandable.  I'll be going back."
vYeSTLvRuTuWoZV6tmvAxw,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,4,"Great little place with a good vibe.  I had the tempeh breakfast burrito which was delicious and huge.  The g/f had a salad with kale, beets, green beans and white hummus which was tasty but just a little oily.  Fresh squeezed OJ capped it off.

Good selection with a handful of daily specials.  The cinnamon French toast is a head turner, making me wish I had opted for something a little less healthy.

Friendly service, limited outdoor seating, diverse clientele.  Overall, a solid addition to the area."
LR1JNvpNrx2N4HNAyhHvrg,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,2,"It's funny what a difference a couple years, and some positive buzz, can make. This place has gone from a quiet little neighborhood haunt to a hangout for Jersey shore rejects looking for a fight to a trendy hotspot - all while remaining essentially the same.

Nothing extraordinary in the way of decor, selection or service - but popular, so if  that's your thing enjoy it while you can - who knows what it will be in another year."
tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,4,"Disclaimer: AC is within walking distance of my place, so I probably am a bit biased.

Summary: A nice, comfortable little restaurant with an underrated happy hour and friendly (though sometimes hard to understand) service.

I come here mostly for the sushi - not because it's outstanding but rather since Zen 32 closed shop it's the only game in the immediate neighborhood and, though very limited (we're talking 10 options) it's not horrible.

Solid happy hour - discounts on the sushi and other items like pot stickers, crab puffs & edamame.  Good deals on sake bombers and beer which they now offer 2-3 kinds on tap.

The main dishes are tasty and ample.  It does a pretty good takeout business.  Friendly bartenders and waitstaff, ample parking.  If you're looking for the 'in' crowd you won't find it here - you're better off making your way elsewhere."
wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,3,"The patio is great.  They have a tasty house red.  The service was excellent.

That's the good...

I had the pesto pasta with chicken.  My girlfriend had the chicken parm.  It seems it would be difficult to strip flavor from Italian food but they managed it.  Both dishes were surprisingly, disappointingly bland.

Other things we noticed - it's very loud inside, so if you want to talk without yelling hit the patio.  It also seems a little pricy for what you get.

In short, if you're looking for some good Italian with a neighborhood feel do yourself a favor and make the short drive west to Giuseppe's (28th and Indian School.)"
YtUaJkgKc1pucwdSq_DQeQ,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,2,"Everyone I've talked to that likes this place says the same thing, ""I've been going there for years.""  Yes - and perhaps years ago it didn't feel like a dive restaurant in constant jeopardy of being shut down for health code violations.  But now...

The food is completely, unmistakably mediocre.  As is the service.  Maybe it's not filthy - maybe it's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way.  But I'm pretty sure the roach I saw dart up the wall was real.

(Okay - that's a cheap shot - there are probably roaches in many places I've gone and I just haven't seen them.  Fair point.)

Nothing about this place makes it a can't miss.  I get the history, the nostalgia, and the fact that some famous people have dined there, but you can find better Mexican food all over the Valley and some just a short drive away."
Ns20WGWn6s6niKAGIQB4UQ,bVMOrLZdGfOm4xxL-oZNWQ,4,"As a concert venue - 4 stars - easy to get to, friendly staff, affordable drinks, good sound and a stream of good acts.  A welcome addition to downtown PHX.

As a restaurant - 2 stars - and here's why:

The Good: the guacamole appetizer - holy deliciousness.  The best I've had in a long time.  Try it.

The Bad: The Ensalada Cortado - a salad with a variety of greens and corn nuts - sounds delicious but was doused in so much dressing it was almost like a soup.  Strangely sweet while at the same time void of flavor.  Who knew?

The Ugly: The Al Pastor Pork Burrito - where to begin...  Mostly just beans, and more beans, surrounding a few slabs of fat-laden, hard to chew pork.  Not to be crass but this little beauty forced me to hit the restroom 4 times before noon the next day.  So I guess what I'm saying is, you have been warned.

Summary: I'd go back to see a show any time however I'll be eating elsewhere first."

The staff is friendly and knowledgable.  Their happy hour may be one of the best-kept secrets in town - specials on beer/wine and a large selection of delicious tapas - all from $1 to $3.

If I had to find a flaw I'd say the cavernous ceilings can make it a bit loud during peak times.  If you go with a date that's a soft talker, prepare to do some lip reading."

-e_UQJVTzIPweX4TcPUYVw,4hWXnIzkVcqor3svhBKWcA,1,"Hmmmmmmmm.....

Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....

Yyyyyyyyyeah.

OK, so Sexx32, sorry, I mean...MEXX32...hey it's not my fault you named your glorified bar/happy hour spot after intercourse. What do you THINK people envision when they read Mexx? Anyway, after being UNDERwhelmed recently at this owner's place two doors down, Delux, (Mexx32 and Delux are owned by the same absentee owner) we took our saddles to Mexxx32 because in passing, the space looks ultra-modern/hip and the food looked pretty decent, from afar.

However, once seated...the cooks in the (open) kitchen were goofing around WAY too much. It's disconcerting as your first impression and visual to see rowdy dudes not paying attention to food preparation in the kitchen. And the waitress was just straight-up r-u-d-e. English is my guest's second language and the middle-aged woman ""serving"" us had NO patience for my guest or my guest's questions about drinks and the menu.

We ordered an app and the plate had a sizable gash in it. Just what I want to think about when dipping my chip into a sauce: bits of shattered porcelain. Mmmm, torn stomach lining. I asked for a fresh serving in a new dish and the incredulous waitress looked at me puzzled, as if she KNEW there was no way any dish in Mexxx32 could possibly be broken and in-service. She actually reproached us midway between our table and the kitchen, yelling ""That's not a chip, that's avocado!"" Confused looks by us. Her gaze turns again towards the dish. ""Oh""...upon looking closer at the broken dish, ""oh it's cracked."" And she reluctantly retreats to the kitchen.

This is Service 101 and it appears to be a HUGE issue at Mexxx32: don't treat your customers like a scolded child and at least pretend to have patience when someone is visiting your restaurant for the first time and is not familiar with your menu AND is making a first (and last impression). Also: your cooks should act somewhat professionally when in FULL VIEW of the guests.

I haven't done this in a lllllllong time....but we walked before the rest of the food came out. Screw you, Mexxx32; there are a million restaurants in Metro Phoenix and we'll never return to your poorly-managed space."
VSX3ixrqQFwwGBUf15s0EQ,4hWXnIzkVcqor3svhBKWcA,4,"This is really 4.5 stars...but Yelp won't allow halfsies, so...

I've been here a few times now, and I'm a fan. They train their servers well. Not flawless, but pretty much on top of it. Waters are refilled without having to ask. The service staff knows quite a bit about the menu. Good stuff. The WATER is perfectly chilled without even using ice and their glasses are cold, too. This simple tactic alone almost wins me over. Especially being in the hottest city on Earth.

The food: on my first visit I had a fairly standard, basic salad. The kind of salad that across the way at Bianco's would be mixed green lettuce with olives and parmesan cheese (gross, I can make that at home). But at Grassroots, the basic salad is loaded with fresh vegetables, comes with a very good dressing, and the portion is huge, more than 1 can eat. Major respect for quality salad design, Grassroots!

Second visit the girl had a cocktail that she liked. Forget which one, but it wasn't too sweet but the right amount of sweet. Bartender did a good job. I tried the shrimp Po' Boy since I was told it was the most popular thing on the menu. Smallish in size but BIG in flavor. And I would MUCH rather have a smaller portion that is impeccable than a large portion of slop. Good grilled asparagus side.

The one drawback of this meal with the appetizer, the smoked salmon itself was GREAT - perfect texture, flavor, and didn't taste 1000% salty. However the toasted white bread that came with was WAY too toasted; cut the roof of your mouth toasted. Granted, they were going for a bruschetta texture and style...however with a proper bruschetta you would use baguette bread and add olive oil to not over-crisp it. The white bread actually used for our app was 1) over-toasted and 2) no oil was added. It was unfortunate, but attention to every detail is what makes a restaurant 5 stars.

The coconut creme pie we sampled for dessert was delicious in taste but pretty sloppily topped. I myself - don't care about dessert presentation. I thought the taste was perfect - filling was sweet but not overly-sugared, the graham cracker crust was perfect. The girl noticed that the whipped cream topping was messily slathered on, and a truly fine establishment would give more attention to detail. Again, I agree, but it still didn't prevent me from enjoying the dessert thoroughly.

In short: a very delicious place with solid service that has the potential to be great if they tie up loose ends such as the above mentioned. :)"
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,4hWXnIzkVcqor3svhBKWcA,3,"10 years ago, Delux was the spot. Phoenix was less a foodie town, and there were FAR fewer options for burgers around 2005. and so Delux was a place i hit whenever i visited Phx. now that i live here, and i see Delux more often and have gone there a few times over the past couple years, i'm gonna say it's a straight-up middle of the road burger joint with pretty decent parking and seating...but high-ish prices for what you get and a fairly obnoxious noise level inside, sometimes from the servers themselves when they congregate by the order-up area.

THE FOOD
ordered a burger well and it was plain BURNT, son! major problems there when you a BURGER joint serving burnt bricks. BOO.

fries were good and dipping aioli and catsup complemented nicely. but holy hell there's A LOT of salt there. i would like more potato flavor and less sodium...but these are probably frozen and not fresh cut and so there ya go.

sandwiches...meh...similar to Crapplebee's or Chili's. big portions of wholesale supermarket ingredients.

dessert - afterthought.

booze selection - good.

shakes - COME ON, all shakes are delicious.

THE SERVICE
on a recent visit we had Doug and he was FIVE STARS all day - a true professional doing the best one can in a mediocre environment. again, some of the other servers were loud as all get-out by the pick-up area and that was unpleasant. the noise in Delux is pretty healthy to begin with. i don't need the damn supervisor (hipster dude with glasses) amping it up to 11 with his cackling and joking with his staff: GET BACK TO WORK!

so, depending on who you get, service can be quite great........or dumb.

THE LOCATION
hip decor...ACOUSTICS FOR SH*T - sorry but this place is just too LLLOOOUUUDDD if it's even half full. having a bar SO close to the sit-down dining is a bad design, because it makes those tables and chairs ---too close together to start with--- even more claustrophobic.

THE PARKING
easy peasy. it's a damn strip mall so boomshackalacka.

PRICES
for Applebee's-level food: high. about $25 per person with drinks and $20 per without.

OVERALL
Delux burger has peaked. at least half of the service is not properly trained or monitored. the food is meh; the drinks are boppin but the space is too uncomfortable for a long haul. pass. next time i'd rather try Two Hippies, Smash Burger, or a funky Hillstone for that matter."
MM8n7SPaIuMlDGbUM5SZhA,4hWXnIzkVcqor3svhBKWcA,1,"Nnnnooo...I prefer to order my own snacks for a movie before I enter the theater, thank you very much. I don't like buzzing my server like I'm in a Boeing 747 cabin & then wwwwwait for a damn popcornsies and soda.

I've seen TOO many movies here, but by gosh it's close to home. Last weekend I went to a random Harkins in the East Valley and the customer service and food seemed like a damn paradise compared to the Sit N PoOt AMC Dine-in and Get Gassy Theatres Esplanade 14.

The low-down:

1) Do you like sitting next to gassy neighbors eating greasy burgers, fries, jalapeno poppers and drinkin beer in the dark? Do you like smelling the results during 120 minutes of CGI space villains?

2) Some of the servers here are friendly and on-it. Some have seen better days. But no matter WHAT it takes too long to order...too long to get yer food...and too long to PAY. And of course the check/tip/process comes during the movie's conclusion. Annoyburgers! Grrrr!

3) THE VOLUME IN THESE THEATERS = ALWAYS WAY TO LLLOOOWWW. Seriously you will be straining to hear the movie because either the projector room dudes are slackin and smokin, or the speaker systems here are freakin WEAK. Or maybe both.

4) In ALL my times here, I have never once seen a manager enter the theater during a movie to test the picture and sound...something good movie theaters do regularly. Again, AMC PoOt and Toot doesn't care about your experience, so wtf, ya know?

5) Only a few seats per theater means if you go during peak times and you don't order ahead online to reserve your seat, forget it. I am a fan of the online reservation system. However I am NOT a fan of 30 seats per theater.

6), 7) and 8) Probably THE MOST ANNOYING facet of the Poot N Toot theater is the PAPER THIN WALLS, so you will always hear the movies playing next door to you. AMAZING since when you're in the damn theater you can barely hear YOUR movie. It's like all the speakers are positioned away from the audience and towards the walls. ARGH!!!

9) and 10) 20-40 minutes of trailers and commercials before your main attraction starts. F*ck you, AMC.

The good:

-Parking is easy. Just validate, jabroni.
-They tend to show the movies you want to see.
-The central Phx location.

Will I go back here? Unfortunately, yes. Just. Because. It's. So. Close. Will I go often? No. Will I EVER again patronize their gross food/kitchen? No. Popcorn = cold. Meats = cheap. Suds = not while I'm watching a movie, boss. I will pay as little as I possibly can because I just. want. to. see. the. movie.

Stupid concept. Indifferent management. Gross operations. Awesome location.

Poot."

kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Had a chance visit Pan Asia this past Saturday after our 5.5 mile hike up South Mountain.  My sister and her bf raves about this place so we decided to lunch here at noon.

I liked the look and feel of the restaurant on the inside.  The place sort of feels trendy and reminded me a bit of the restaurants I used to frequent in L.A.  We requested a booth for our group of four and were seated pretty quickly (the table was way too high for the booth).  At noon on a Saturday, the place was halfway full.

We found out that all food was 1/2 off regular prices on Saturday (dine-in only), so that excited me.  We ended up ordering the following items:

* Crispy Crab Puffs ($4/$2) - these little triangles of fried wontons filled with cream cheese and ""crab"" were delish...according to the others at my table.  I didn't try any, so can't attest the taste.

* Crispy Tofu ($6/$3) - deep fried tofu cubes served with their supposed-to-be-spicy sauce.  Although not spicy, the sauce was awesome...think dark soy with caramelized sugar.  This was my fave dish.

* Fire Roll ($15/$7.50) - A California-style roll topped off with their sauteed shrimp in a special sauce, with a Bacardi ring around the plate, which was lit by the waiter at our table.  The show was the best part of this roll.  CA rolls are so boring, and although the sauteed shrimp tasted good, it tasted exactly like the walnut shrimp dishes I've had at other restaurants.  (see photo)

* Japanese Lasagna ($10/$5) - A crab and avocado roll with cream cheese spread on top and baked until melted.  Call me crazy, but when I saw the name of this roll, I expected to see some pasta tossed with a wasabi-based sauce.

* Las Vegas Roll ($8/$4) - Eel, ""crab"", avocado and cream cheese roll that's dipped in batter and deep fried.  These were decent, but what fried item isn't?

* Chicken Fried Rice ($7.95/$3.98) - this was delicious!  They included many pieces of juicy chicken pieces.  The rice was fried perfectly...not greasy at all.  This and the deep fried tofu were my fave items.

The bill came to $27 (pre-tax and tip), so we felt we got a great deal.  The rolls are a bit on the skinny side, but not indecently so.

Their menu is pretty vast, so I'm looking forward to going back and trying other dishes...especially the Chinese items."
vlJsF5tTfplbo1D5kbUPmQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"I had dinner at Aiello's with eleven others last Saturday.  Upon entering, I was hit with the wonderful aroma of Italian food and quickly took note of the cozy ambiance (always important to me).  This seemed to be a good date spot as there were several tables with couples.  Also, the restaurant was full of patrons but did not seem crowded, which was nice.

They did not have my white of choice, Riesling, so I opted for a glass of the Salvalai Pinot Grigio ($8).  We skipped appetizers and instead noshed on the fresh bread and dipping sides (loved the spicy peppers).

I wanted to try the pesto gnocchi but when I saw spaghetti alla puttanesca ($15) on the menu, I had to order it.  Puttanesca is one of my specialties, so I was interested in finding out how their version would compare to mine.  When the waitress set the plate in front of me, I was excited; the smell and look of the dish was right.  However, when I took the first bite, I noticed right away it was too salty.  The olives were served whole (there were quite a few of them) and the chef was a little too heavy-handed with the olive oil and anchovies.  Since the puttanesca sauce require ingredients that are already salty (capers, olives, anchovy fillets), it's especially important to balance the salty items with the rest of the ingredients.  When I make the sauce, I slice the Kalamata olives, which helps to temper the briny saltiness. I also add a bit of dry, red wine for added flavor.

For dessert we ordered the tiramisu and cannoli.  I took a bite of each and thought the tiramisu was too light (barely any coffee flavor), but the cannoli was delicious!

I was too distracted by the conversations at our table and only managed to get a few pictures of the dishes from that night.  The others gave the food two thumbs up, so this gives me hope for my next visit.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  Kudos to her for being willing to split the check multiple ways."
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"Went here for dinner last Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday. Being that our group was large (18) and the private dining room was already booked, we were seated in the patio area. (Luckily the weather was nice around 8p.m.) Roka Akor is a beautiful restaurant, from the inside out.

I ordered the Unagi ($8.50), Uni sashimi ($13.00), Yellowtail sashimi ($8.00), and two of their blood orange margaritas ($10 each). When they brought out my order, all I could think was ""wow!"" (See pics)

The Unagi (freshwater eel), Uni (sea urchin) and Yellowtail looked and tasted fresh - the Uni melted in my mouth (yum).

The blood orange margaritas were strong and DELICIOUS and were served in tall glasses (looks sort of like champagne flutes) - the red from the blood orange added a nice pop of color (very elegant looking). The restaurant gets top points for presentation.

This is a great spot for a date, but I wouldn't recommend sitting in the patio area if you're looking for romantic ambiance.

Service is here top-notch, which is very important if one is going to be paying premium prices for food. Our waitress was very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt.

I'd definitely dine here again.

Btw - there is free valet and self-parking."
WEoivlVObGE03PiWvVvXYA,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Went here last night with a couple of girl friends.  We spent some time trying to come up with a place to go for food, drinks, dancing, and people watching.  The restaurants/bars/nightclubs in Scottsdale came to mind for people watching, but as we were on our way, I remembered my sister's recommendation to check out Cadillac Ranch (""CR"").

I took a chance that CR might provide some entertainment.  Parking was plentiful (and free) since CR is located at the huge Tempe Marketplace.  We arrived around 10pm and after walking up the flight of stairs (in 4"" heels, mind you) to the guy checking ID, we were granted quick entrance into CR.

The inside is pretty spacious, with dark lighting.  There are two bars, one on the inside and a larger one in the patio area.  There are plenty of booths scattered throughout the area, along with some tables.  We were told we can sit anywhere as long as there isn't a ""reserved"" sign.  We snagged a booth near the small dance floor and had to wait about 15 minutes before our waitress came by to take our food and drink orders.

Mango Tango Margaritas at $6.50 each - The bartender did not skimp on the alcohol in this frozen drink; it packed a wallop!  The first drink was so good, I had to buy a second round.

A friend ordered a Cherry Limeade ($6.50) and said she didn't taste the alcohol, so she ordered a Mango Tango Margarita too (sure got her buzzed).  I just can't believe the price...$6.50.  That will buy me half a mixed drink in L.A.  Another friend ordered straight vodka on the rocks...$6 each.

We ordered the Southwest Chicken Egg Rolls ($8.79) and the Cowboy Sliders ($8.79) to share.  The Southwest Chicken Egg Rolls were pretty spicy...and tasted ok.  The Cowboy Sliders looked more like four small burgers instead of the tiny sliders that I'm used to. The sliders came with a side of fries.  The meat was overcooked, so the sliders tasted mediocre to me (prefer my burgers to be done medium-rare to medium-well).  For the price, the portions are decent.

We later hit the bar at the patio and for two vodka on the rocks and one kami-kaze.  The total?  $18!  WHAT?  That price, for three drinks, is unheard of in L.A.!  I tipped the bartender very generously.

BTW, this is supposed to be a nightclub, as the DJ has club music blasting in your ears (almost overly loud).  Don't bring any dates here expecting to have a conversation.

Music consisted of straight 80s, 90s, and current hip hop and top 40s...including mashups of the aforementioned genres.  I was kind of tripped out to see GoGo dancers on their tiny dance floor podiums.  Seeing cute GoGo dancers doing their thing just didn't seem cohesive with the casual atmosphere of CR.

As far as the type of crowd...there was a mix of men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s.  It was fun to watch people dancing...and did I mention the mechanical bull?  Always fun to watch buzzed/drunk people try to handle the mechanical bull.

The place started to fill up around midnight...to the point where the small dance floor was completely packed.

We left CR around 1:30am and the place was still pumping.

All in all, we enjoyed our experience at CR and will be back here for more good times...when my friends and I don't feel like dealing with the pretentiousness of Scottsdale.  The more I venture into Scottsdale (think W Hotel), the more I feel like I never left L.A. (ugh).

On another note, the new Airia Nightclub just opened inside the Gila River Bend Casino.  Although I don't gamble, we'll be checking out the new nightclub and lounges there soon enough (to see if the renovated casino lives up to the hype)."
QYIhMNwxXejDoCr-F1BxDg,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Ate here a couple of weeks ago around noon on a Saturday.  Upon entering the place, we were pleasantly surprised by the cute atmosphere.  The waitresses there are pretty friendly and served with a smile.  Our party of three ordered from their lunch specials:

* Spicy noodles with pork

* Spicy Thai basil with ground chicken

* Eggplant with tofu

The portions were huge, considering that it was lunchtime.  We ate family style, so I was able to taste all three.  We requested all three dishes made spicy, and in terms of the level of spice, I rate them as medium-spicy.

The spicy pork noodles were flavorful and moist, the Thai basil chicken was good (not great), and the eggplant and tofu dish was kind of flavorless.  The cook could have left out the broccoli and bamboo, and added a bit more ground chicken and basil to the Thai basil dish, and it would have appealed to me more.

We ordered two Thai iced teas and one Thai iced coffee.  The drinks came in long, tall glasses...well worth the price for each drink.  The Thai iced tea was good, but the iced coffee was too sweet and had a weird aftertaste. Oh yeah, they serve this cabbage and tofu soup (flavorful) as a pre-courser to your entrees.

Overall, the food was good for a quick lunch, but nothing to write home about.  The price for each dish was around $7-$8."
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"I used to eat here often with family a few years ago.  I decided to visit Hunan Express again a couple of weeks ago and I'm disappointed (and sad) to report that the quality of food here has changed.

My fave items were the Honey-dipped Chicken Wings ($2.50) appetizer and the Hunan Special Chicken ($7.10).

They seem to have changed the batter for the honey-dipped chicken wings, the wing sections appear much smaller (less meat), and the sauce is much darker now (can't tell that it's honey).  The sauce was also too salty...too much soy sauce mixed in with the honey perhaps?

Although the Hunan special chicken is good, it's not as tasty as it used to be.  Or, maybe my tastebuds became more picky ever since I lived in L.A.?  ;-P

I also ordered the General Tao's Chicken ($7.10 / decent) and the Vegetable Tofu (in brown sauce / $6.85).  The General Tao's Chicken tasted alot like the Hunan Special Chicken (deep fried chicken pieces in brown sauce).

The Chinese husband and wife team that takes the orders up front were friendly as usual."
kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,2,"Since I eat Cambodian food every week at home, I wasn't tempted to dine here, but my sis and mom have been wanting to check it out for a while.

We dined here a few weeks ago and left feeling...underwhelmed.  Service provided by the brother and sister duo was friendly; however, the food, although decent, was a bit too Westernized for my taste.  As another Yelper has mentioned, the portions are too small for the advertised prices.

We ordered the following (shared between five adults and one child):  1) beef noodle soup (similar to the Vietnamese pho / $6); 2) lok lac beef (marinated pan fried cubes of beef / $8); 3) chicken fried rice ($8); 4) pleah (beef salad $10); 5) bbq platter (shrimp & beef skewers, chicken wings / $14); and 6) pork/pate sandwich ($5).

The good:
* entrees were presented beautifully on green plates reminiscent of banana leaves
* with the exception of the pleah (beef salad), the food looked good and tempting
* with the exception of the lok lac beef, food arrived in a fairly timely manner
* the beef skewers were delicious (can really taste the flavor of the marinade, especially the lemongrass)
* iced coffee I ordered was good (albeit a bit weaker than the Viet kind / $3)
* basil seed drink was good (and interesting to look at / $2)
* as previously mentioned, service was friendly
* the restaurant is decorated appropriately with Cambodian items

The bad:
* while the rest of the entrees arrived within 20 minutes after ordering, my lok lac beef was brought to the table an HOUR later
* the portion size of the lok lac beef is more indicative of a lunch serving, not dinner
* the flavor of the lok lac was decent, but not as robust as usual (perhaps the beef cubes weren't given enough time to marinate)
* the pleah (beef salad) was TOO tart and had us thinking, ""where's the beef?"" (it did not look nor tasted like the traditional pleah we're used to - Cambodian beef ceviche)
* bring your sunglasses because the lighting in the restaurant is bright!!!

I know it makes sense to tone down some of the Cambodian flavors, but it's too toned down for my taste.  With that said, if you've not had Cambodian food, Sekong would be a good introduction to the dishes of Cambodia.  Sekong is to be commended for offering Cambodian food to valley residents.

For authentic Cambodian cuisine, you'll have to go to the LA area.  They don't care about toning down the flavors there to suit Western tastes, because shoot, there are loads of Asians to fill up their restaurants.

(In addition to the food pics from Sekong, I also posted a pic of lok lac beef I ordered from one of the LA restaurants...for comparison.)"
Hr5h_LG9TMBLlFz_Oici0A,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,2,"Based on rave reviews from other Yelpers, I went to Caffe Boa with high expectations.  Alas, my experience there was a bit of a disappointment due to said high expectations.

My sister and I had a reservation for an early dinner (5pm) yesterday and after lucking out on a parking spot right in front (coin-operated meter); we were seated pretty quickly by the (unsmiling) hostess.  At this time, we were probably the third occupied table in the restaurant.

The décor and vibe featured a modern and elegant main dining room on the inside and an intimate patio area decorated with intertwining vines and bursts of colors from flowers.  The restaurant began to fill up by 6pm and consisted mostly of casual to business-casual middle-aged folks.

I started off with a glass of their Pinot Grigio ($7) and found it to be very smooth and strong.  The Brushetta ($10) consisted of huge slices of Ciabatta bread, topped with slices olives, capers, chunks of tomatoes, and slices of basil.  This was my fave dish of the night as it was so full of flavor (albeit a bit chunky in texture).  We tried eating this as daintily as we could but ended up making a big mess.

I was wavering between trying the Agnolotti (grilled forest mushroom ravioli) or the Autumn Maccaroncello (butternut squash with wild honey sauce and goat cheese pasta) and opted for the Maccaroncello ($17) since I was intrigued by the combination of ingredients.  When the waiter brought the dish over, my belly did a happy flip since it looked and smelled delicious.  I took the first bite and although the initial taste was packed full of butternut squash and cheese flavor, I was a bit taken aback by the saltiness of the sauce and the ""too al dente"" texture of the pasta.  I drank a sip of water to cleanse my palate and tried another bite...with the same result!  Being an optimist (when it comes to food), I drank a sip of the wine and tried another bite...same darn result!  Sigh, sigh, sigh!  At this point I felt full and so settled back to watch my sister pick at her dish...read below.

My sister initially chose the Toasted Herb Gnocchi (milk braised Dutch Valley veal sweetbreads in gravy) but after being told by the waiter that the sweetbreads won't be ready for consumption for who knows how long, she opted for the Mezzaluna Ravioli ($16 / pork stuffed ravioli in broth).  When the waiter brought her plate over, I almost choked on my glass of wine.  The darned dish looked just like a bowl of steamed wontons in broth that one can find at a Chinese restaurant! My sister said it tasted just like wontons too and offered me a bite...which I declined.

Although we wanted to try the tiramisu, we opted out of that due to our disappointment in our dishes.

Our waiter provided very good service and seemed eager to please. Caffe Boa's website boasts that their menu consists of Mediterranean, Slavic, Asian, and Cajun preparation and states that they focus on using seasonally inspired, all natural, organic ingredients.  I agree that their ingredients seemed fresh and I did taste the Asian influence in the dishes; however, the effort fell short of my expectations.  I admire the chef for his innovation though, and will have to give this restaurant another try before I completely give up on them.

Overall, for one glass of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees, our bill came to approximately $50 (before tip)."
U2W22Vy1oSs4G7W-2vdQ4w,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,1,"Ugh...that pretty much sums up my experience at Thai Rama.  I was in AZ visiting family and took my family to eat Thai, expecting Char's to still be there.  When we arrived, saw that name was changed to Thai Rama...no big deal.  Place looked clean and the waitress was friendly.

I ordered my usual Thai dishes:
- Pad Thai (weird medicine taste...definitely wrong sauce)
- Pork Larb (too sour...not enough fish sauce...not as spicy as I requested)
- Pork Rad Nah (sauce tasted too bland...lots of sauce though)
- Tom Yum Gung (sigh...I can still remember the disappointment I felt as I tasted this seemingly ""canned"" soup)

I guess I am used to the authentic Thai food from Chars and Thai restaurants in L.A., so I had high expectations.  It's hard to find a good, authentic Thai restaurant in AZ.  I miss Chars!

Would I go here again?  No."
DTvcpHf2gGKgSujUVXA7sA,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"The first time I went here, I got the shredded beef burrito ($6.29) and thought it was just ok (it was HUGE).  However, I LOVED their warm chips ($.99) and guacamole ($2.69)!

Although I've revisited this location, I haven't tried anything else off their menu...I just run in for an order of chips and guacamole.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the lightly salted chips and tangy guac.

BTW, although I prefer Qdoba's chips, for burritos, I prefer Baja Fresh.  As others have mentioned, Qdoba is just like Chipotle.  It's even located across the street from Chipotle...go figure."
ZhjU0FkCIaG43F83TwSN8w,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"Went by this D&B for lunch and some games earlier today.

I'm not usually a fan of D&B food, but today I tried the Parmesan Chicken Alfredo ($11) and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  The portion was large, so felt like I got my money's worth.  The others ordered the Goldfingers Eat & Play Combo ($15.99 / chicken tenders & fries) and the Buffalo Bar Chicks (pretty much buffalo chicken tenders on dinner rolls).

This D&B's gaming area is smaller than the one I go to in Arcadia (CA) and there are fewer games too.  My sister assures me this D&B is pretty happening during weekends/evening hours, but right now I have a hard time believing this.  I'll go with friends next time and have a few drinks at the bar during evening hours.

It feels nice to not have to ""fight"" other patrons for the games.  I like to ""cheat"" and get loads of tickets by spinning that huge ticket wheel...always a line for that one.  I hit the jackpot and got 1,000 tickets...yay!!!

The prizes aren't worth much, but hey, we go here to have fun and pretend to be kids for a few hours.

I love that this D&B is located at the Tempe Marketplace.  I can take off to go shopping if I get bored, hehe."
6N9NClBpOi-GoWckg137NQ,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"Was in the Chandler area three weeks ago and decided to stop by this place to pick up some dinner on my way home.

I ordered the General Tso's Chicken ($9.95), Beef Chow Fun ($7.25), Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($6.50), and Chicken Fried Rice ($6.50).

The food took forever to get ready, but boy, it was worth the wait since it was delicious!!!  For such reasonable prices, the portions were huge and the quality/taste of the dishes was a nice surprise.  My mom is picky when it comes to restaurant food, but she LOVED the chow fun.

The menu looks pretty extensive, with reasonable prices.  If you're looking for ambiance, this isn't the place.  However, for a casual dine-in experience or takeout, this place will hit the spot.

Their lunch menu items are nicely priced too...ranging from $4.50 to $5.75.  Looks like they're open 7 days a week, from 10:30am-10:30pm.

Too bad I now live in Tempe, otherwise I would stop by more often."
tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,3,"My friends and I decided to eat here this past Saturday around 9pm, just to kill some time before we went upstairs to Airia Nightclub.  We were a group of five and since there was an hour wait for a table, we opted to sit at the bar.

Food:
I didn't have time to peruse the menu since I was too busy chatting, so I chose the first thing that caught my eye - the New Wave Pad Thai ($13.99).  The other gals ordered the Korean Sizzling Salmon ($14.99), Thai Mussel Bowl ($11.99), Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll ($9.99), and the same Pad Thai dish.

I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portion of my New Wave Pad Thai; it was enough to feed at least two as a full meal.  There were plenty of chicken breast chunks and shrimp.  The sauce was a bit on the tart side, and although not a groundbreaking dish, I enjoyed the flavor. (See pics.)

The portions for the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and Thai Mussel Bowl were also generous.  I tried a piece of the sushi roll and was not impressed; the ""tempura"" was too crunchy, probably a result of being over-fried.

Drinks:
Four of us tried the Forbidden Dragon (looks like a Mojito / $7.99) and the other tried the Frozen Thai Mai (not Mai Thai, mind you / $7.99).  The Forbidden Dragon consisted of pineapple rum, mint, lime juice, pineapple juice, and was served with a floater (shot) of absinthe.  My drink wasn't strong enough for my taste, but still, I liked the flavor - had a hint of licorice (from the absinthe).

Pros:
- quick and attentive service by bar staff
- generous food portions at reasonable prices
- interesting menu with lots of choices
- located downstairs from Airia Nightclub

Cons:
- lack of ambiance (too bright and smoke/noise from the casino floor filtered in through the open spaces where windows should have been)
- not enough alcohol in the specialty drinks"
6ZIHxvFTHC1pvAzAS0uLDA,o2XiSzzcei1nx9vev6waPA,4,"I always make it a point to visit Lee's Sandwiches everytime I'm in AZ.  Luckily my family lives in Chandler and just a few blocks from Lee's.

Sandwiches always taste fresh here.  I normally order a few sandwiches for me and the family.  My favorite is the special combo #11.  Others we've tried are the regular Lee's combo #1, grilled pork #5, BBQ pork #6, and their ham & cheese croissant.  You can opt to have the veggies on the side.

They bake their bread onsite, so it always tastes fresh.  The last time I visited AZ, the #11 sandwich was $2+ each, but when I went by today, it was up to $3.05.  Still, that's cheap for a filling sandwich.  The #5 and #6 are $2.85 each.  They have hot food items for sale off to the right of the registers, such as steamed pork buns, which are $1.75 each.  Thai iced teas (no boba) are $2.55 each.

The place is clean and their employees serve you with a smile.

Luckily, there are no Lee's Sandwiches near my house in L.A.; the closest one is about 30 miles.  Otherwise, I would be eating one everyday!

Parking can be hard to find during busy hours, but you can always park at the Walgreens lot next door."
len2nrEtgD9bjnoYSyLPjA,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"3.5 stars :) Got their take out.  Ordered a couple sides of gyros and a starter platter.  Got the falafel, tabouleh, dolmades, spanakopita and baklava.

Called in the order and it was complete and ready when I got there.  I really liked the dolmades and falafel.  The tzatziki was good too.  Didn't care at all for the spanakopita... the dough seemed bitter or something.  Just weird taste to it, the filling was better.  I wasn't crazy about the baklava either.  I usually like the filo pastry to be very flaky an crispy and this wasn't.

Not saying I wouldn't go back, just giving an honest opinion of my experience."
UHPjDgiEHnTe7-MP-b2kyQ,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,5,"I went to this place for the first time a couple months ago, was on my lunch break and had stopped somewhere nearby and stumbled upon it.  Let me just say, I wondered HOW I didn't know about this place sooner.

I ordered the Chicken Milanese, which was great, but what REALLY blew me away were the meatballs and absolutely delicious sauce!!

I received a card in the mail from the owner's (handwritten) thanking me for coming, so it jogged my memory to write this review.  I was very impressed by the fact that the owner's took the time to send that card and thank a patron.  I will FOR SURE be back, in fact the day I went there I raved about them on Facebook.

Other notable things to mention:  The service was excellent, and the ambience was nice too.  And they have outdoor seating as well."
u_vSbtOYpfnzhFRfEhqfyg,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,5,"Looking for a spot to eat for lunch in Gainey Ranch and happened to come across this place.  OMG delicious!! I ordered a combo platter with 1/4 rack of ribs and 1/4 chicken.  The side I chose was the baked beans and also got the charred corn on the cob.  The platter was only $12 and let me just tell you, you DEFINITELY get your money's worth.  I ate everything on my plate.  The chicken was tender, the ribs were very meaty.  The baked beans were outstanding.  Looked like 3 different beans they use and a good portion in a bowl on the side.  The bbq sauce it was all cooked in was very tasty.  I asked for more on the side and they brought it out right away.

I wish I got the names of the staff, I didn't :( But the service was friendly and prompt and it looks like they all help each other out.  The owner or chef also came out to ask how everything was, which I thought was a nice touch.

I am pretty stoked we have a BBQ place of this caliber in this area, as I don't really know of any in the immediate area.  I really hope to see this place succeed and bring in some big business.  Amazing, will for sure be back!!!"
lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,4,"I'm being generous and giving this 4 stars...reason being service. My bartender was NOT FRIENDLY.  Smile. Interact. Speak. Anything she said she sounded annoyed and like it was forced. I felt like I was a nuisance to her. Maybe it was just her personality (or lack thereof) or maybe she was having a bad day. But it felt very tense and uncomfortable. If you don't like your job, quit. Find one you like. Life is too short. And if you're not a friendly person by nature, stay the hell out of the hospitality industry and certainly don't bartend. All you're gonna do is spread around your miserable attitude and bring down the morale/reputation of the place.

With that said, the food was good. And everyone else was super friendly and accommodating.

Rant over :)"
4HEF6BuO_BBsTmvcMCbhhg,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,4,"Tried out Sorso on my lunch break... ordered 2 pieces of bruschetta - Gorgonzola with seasonal fruit - (thinly sliced fresh nectarines) and the Roasted tomato and Avocado.  Both were delicious.  Also ordered the Hummus platter - came with a beautiful assortment of fresh veggies, including watermelon radish, which I don't see everyday.... that was good too.  My only complaint on that though would be the hummus was VERY heavy on garlic in my opinion.  Some people like that I realize, but for myself personally it was overpowering for my taste.

Service was excellent, being that it was my first time, the server explained the menu to me and made recommendations.  I LOVE the concept of the wine towers - you can serve yourself with a prepaid card - over 130 wines available to taste and try.  I will definitely be back for a happy hour soon!"
3QQEc5QUP-h6LCkUZQEYQw,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"Definitely the spot to go to watch the game or multiple games at once.  There has to be almost 200 TV's in the place.  Also fun to play darts there and I know they have Poker Nights too.

Their food however is NOTHING but typical bar food.  Fried, greasy, and way overpriced in my opinion.  $12 for a burger??? WHAT?  And their pizza, I have heard is good, have never tried but way overpriced as well for what it looks like to me.  I do like that they seem to have a vast selection of choices - salads too.  Stromboli and Calzones are on the menu as well.  I also notice that they have daily drink and food specials (nothing to get excited about price wise either).  The service was good, and always has been good there in my experience, so I am not discrediting that.

I will keep going there, but not to eat!  If you want greasy bar fare, there are a MILLION places nearby that are way more affordable."

Service was prompt and friendly.  Their prices are MORE than reasonable for the portion of food I got.  I ordered the Quinoa Patty and it was HUGE!  Delicious too.  Came with roasted onions and peppers on top with goat cheese.  Superb.  I will definitely be back.

Only thing I found a little odd was that it's a burger place and they don't have pickles.  LOL.  No biggie tho."

We had a small dog with us, which they allowed on the patio.  I ordered a regular margarita on the rocks, some bean dip, and the carne asada burrito.  The salsa they put on the table with the chips was outstanding.  (I assume they make it in house).  My margarita was meh, ok.  I am not a fan of super sweet and it was on the sweet side.  I am assuming they use a mix there, and not fresh lime juice :( I didn't care for the bean dip.. the carne asada burrito was delicious, just needed more meat in my opinion.  The ratio of tortilla to meat was up there.  We also ordered sopapillas for dessert at the end of the meal.  I was NOT a fan.  The cinnamon and sugar were half assed sprinkled on there and not coated completely.  Tasted like a bland donut... save for the honey packets they served us.  Honey PACKETS?? lol.  Overall it was meh.  I gave it 4 stars though cause our server was really nice :)"

I would definitely go back.

I would love to see them do bottomless mimosas and Bloody's but they don't. That would be my one suggestion :)"

I went with 2 friends- I got the Johnny Cakes which were phenomenal, and a huge portion too. It came with 2 sausage links and fresh strawberries on top, a side of the most incredible homemade rice pudding I've ever tasted, with syrup on the side. Soooo good! My friends got the Pain Perdu and the French toast. I love how they do the cold drip coffee as well and U can see the drip system up on the wall.

The line moved quick (you order at the register and then they give you a number and you wait at a table). Also they do not permit you to hold a table while your party goes up and orders and that's something they enforce. You choose your table only after ordering. They bring the food out to you. Service was great as well. Will definitely be back!!!!"

The menu is a great concept, offers a lot of variety of choices but also VERY healthy and clean and it allows you to have fun with it and create different combinations and see what you come up with if you choose to ""make your own"".  I have had the quinoa a number of times but usually get a smoothie.

The service there, in my experience has always been fast and friendly and consistently great!

I highly recommend to anyone who is not just vegan or vegetarian, which I am not, but to anyone who is health conscious and willing to spend a couple extra bucks to put something nutritious into their body!"

The owner is from Chicago (Hence the name!)
He is ALWAYS there, and greets everyone and is super nice.  Every single thing I have ever ordered there is DELISH.  I have not had a single complaint, or been disappointed even once.  Their sandwiches, particularly the eggplant parm and the chicken parm are incredible.  Amazing crusty bread with a huge portion, they don't skimp.  Their sauce is outstanding as well. The meatballs are phenomenal. I am also a fan of their minestrone soup.  I have gone there just for that.  its hearty, needs absolutely nothing sprinkled on or added to it.  And they are consistent.  Always good, every time.

I am actually salivating as I type this review LOL.  Seriously though, if you haven't tried it, please go.  It's a casual, friendly environment, and the food is outstanding, I don't care who you are, Italian or not.

(They offer many different flavored ""Mocktails"" and it was very good).

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the service. It was friendly, but I had to ask for things a couple times before I got them. Not a big deal but the reason why I withheld a star. I would recommend the food and will be back."

Positives:  Service was friendly and the food was good.  The roasted vegetables were simple, but delicious.

What I didn't like though was there was hardly ANY ricotta. Almost an indiscernible amount. Other than that I love the place and will be back for sure!"
edskUGX_9FHCFnDG2ETKIw,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,5,"Stopped in for lunch today and sat at the bar.  I ordered the lunch combo (Half Sonoran chicken sandwich and a cup of soup for $9).  Was still hungry so also got the baked potato and beans.

The food was good, but I was more impressed with the service, which is also why I will be returning.  Brittany gave outstanding service.  Super friendly, was very helpful and comes across with such positive energy - definitely made the experience awesome!  She is an asset to that place for sure.  I plan on coming back for Happy Hour and some live music!"
C2BR0TjNacoNzItPLUHTAA,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,5,"This place is such a GEM.... I have lived literally less than a mile down the street for over a year now and haven't stepped foot in this place... until 2 nights ago. And I already went back again for lunch today.

Definitely a Hawaiian style place, the tables and seats are wooden surfboards, pretty cool.  They have a few beers that they offer on tap, as well as bottled beer and wine.  I cannot convey enough how much I LOVED the food.  First time I went in, I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish burger.  DELICIOUS.  You're going to spend around 15 for the meal but it's worth every penny.  Beautiful cut of fish, you pick the type of seasoning you want.  The cole slaw that they serve with it is outstanding too.  Great flavor and you walk out feeling you got your money's worth and satisfied.

They are known for their fish tacos and I can see why!! I ordered them today.  Two good size, stuffed to the brim tacos so make sure you grab a fork! :)  The service was excellent both times as well.  Happy to answer questions, very helpful, very friendly and efficient staff.

Love it!!!!!!!"
v2tjswIV3e0c8o7_7MwYmg,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"Have only been here a few times, but after last night I just cant again. Service was fine, food was fine. But....their prices are outrageous. I'm someone who gladly pays whatever the price for a great meal, I am not a tight wad by any means. And I always tip at least 20%. Always. But I went in and ordered a small pizza with 3 toppings (small, personal Size, the size of a dinner plate) and 2 drinks and spent $50!!! The pizza came to about 20 bucks for that tiny pizza. I was really annoyed. Felt kind of ripped off. I didn't say anything to the server cause it's not her fault and the prices are what they are. I just feel I could have spent that at La Bocca across the street and got a nice dinner... I just think that's way too steep for 4 small slices of pizza."
ZynSNEGuPvGCj3eYIaLPlQ,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"Came here with a couple friends and sat in the lounge.  Our server was friendly and accommodating and service was timely.  I started off ordering the Butcher's Plate or something like that.  It was supposed to be a board of various cheeses, meats, crostini, olives - that sort of thing.  Didn't really care for it...for $15 bucks, it was a lot of meat and 3 tiny triangles of white cheddar cheese and it was not even that good.

We stayed quite a while, had more drinks, ordered more food.  Ended up getting a bunch of stuff to split and share.  Had the mac and cheese, BBQ sliders, beet salad and tomato soup.  All were alright...."
YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,5,I wish I could convey how delicious the Mexican corn is here. You will just have to try it for yourself. Amazing!!!! I also ordered the Taco Vampiro (carne asada) and the Shrimp Dorado taco. Both delicious as well. The food is a little on the pricey side but well worth it. Very flavorful and the meat was so tender. Love this place!!!
jS3U9iEGnJY7j5oT9iDN7A,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,4,"I was in this place for lunch today and had the chicken fajitas. They were great. But what really impressed me was my server, Fernando. He was did an excellent job on all levels. Greeted me warmly and promptly, served me promptly, used my name and told me about the lunch card and brought it to the table. (Which I hadn't known about) after 5 lunches the 6th is free. I would definitely return!!"
fK9J1uzCHtmMjSHDkSKh6w,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,2,"The ONLY reason I am giving this location 2 stars (which I am reluctant to do) is because of the food.  I was SO put off by the HORRIBLE service we received I couldn't even believe it......

We went in on a Friday night, between 8 and 9, with my boyfriend and a friend.  We expected it to be packed, it was dead as a doornail.  Was greeted by a server.  She couldn't answer any questions about the drinks.  Fine, whatever.  Maybe she's new.  We decided to each order a signature cocktail and my boyfriend ordered a vodka martini.  We sat there for literally 20 mins with no drinks.  FINALLY the server comes back, still with no drinks, to tell us the drink I ordered, that the bar was out of one of the ingredients.  Fine, I order something else.

When we FINALLY got our drinks 30 mins into being there, we ordered our food.  That was brought out piecemeal, fine we weren't fussy. The food was good.

We cringed though everytime we needed to order a drink and actually ordered two at a time because of how long it was taking.  Our server disappeared to God knows where during the service, we had to ask a manager to get her, he didn't seem the least bit concerned about our service.  The bartender sucked too.  Believe me I am not blaming the server solely.  The bar obviously was slow too.

I love Stingray, but will NEVER EVER EVER go back to that location."
Tgc2dTcE1xOey2OUt_PvXA,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"I am giving this one 3 stars because I have always liked Oregano's, although it was usually the Scottsdale locations.  This was my first time at this location in Goodyear... it was a Saturday night and packed like I expected it to be... we got there around 8 and were quoted a 40 minute wait time.  We decided to just eat at the bar, no big deal.  Drinks are reasonably priced... they don't have frozen margaritas or drinks other than a frozen peach bellini concoction that they have from a machine back there.  It was meh.

Lemme just warn you if you aren't already aware - the portion sizes are HUGE here... on one hand it's great cause you get more for your money, but we literally almost filled up on our appetizer and by the time the dinner came we weren't that interested lol.  Ordered the stuffed mushrooms - it ended up being 2 gigantic portobello mushrooms each filled with a mountain of ground sausage and then topped with cheese.  They were tasty.

I then got the eggplant parm, but it just was mediocre at best.  It was a meager size portion of some slices of eggplant (not breaded) on top of a ginormous bed of overcooked angel hair pasta.  I am someone who likes a generous amount of sauce as well, and they were very stingy with the sauce.  When I asked for more on the side, I got a ramekin of thick sauce.  Weird... I basically ate the eggplant and garlic bread and a couple bites of pasta but it was just way too much food for me to finish even if I was STARVING.  My friend got the white pizza and he liked it, but could barely eat that much because he was full too.

I will definitely go back to Oregano's!  Just not on a Weekend night."
cOWXtCz7F9GQhPIks8gm6Q,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,5,"Came here for the first time last night for my birthday with some friends.  Our server, Debbie I believe her name was, was outstanding!  New Yorker, super outgoing, VERY knowledgeable about the menu and explained everything to us.  Service was also prompt and every employee we interacted with that night was also very friendly and accommodating.

We ordered a fantastic bottle of wine that was recommended to us by one of the gentlemen that works there.  Young guy, friendly, seems to know his wines very well.  It was called Brunello.  2009 vintage.  We also ordered olives, risotto, and the fig and prosciutto pizza for the table as appetizers.  All were delicious.

For dinner, I got the Maltagliati pasta (homemade pasta).  Was fantastic.  Everyone else at the table ordered different dishes and everyone liked what they got.  Portions were a nice size too.  The server surprised me with a beautiful dessert for my birthday with a little candle.  Was a really nice touch and very appreciated!! It was homemade mint chocolate cheesecake, little biscotti, and a piece of tiramisu.

I not only recommend this place, but will also be back!"
AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,2,"Finally stopped in for lunch after driving past this place a billion times....really weird inside.  I mean in a lot of ways just your typical, divey bar.  Super ""eclectic"" décor.... bright colors, pish posh of all kinds of different stuff on the walls and ceiling.  Just odd.  Also loud metal music was playing... no biggie, just a casual type bar.

I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.  Asked for extra vegetables.  When I got the plate, it just did NOT look appetizing.  They say you eat with your eyes first. LOL .  But I dug in cause I was hungry.  The sauce was very thick, there was a LOT of it, and it didn't appear that they put extra veggies like I asked.  Just looked like a normal portion.  There is what I thought to be a TON of garlic in the sauce.  Did not find that appealing.  Taste wise, it was just ALRIGHT... I didn't really care for it.

I would not recommend this place for their food that's for sure.  BUT... apparently they have live music and I would probably come back for that and a couple drinks one night.  That's about it though!"
Mkb7dYT-tBGQPy6tUpWMKA,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,4,"Went in for lunch.  Sat at the bar, Alex waited on me.  She was super friendly and the service was prompt.

I ordered a glass of the Pinot Gris out of Oregon.  Was really good, and hit the spot!  Also got the soup of the day which was a potato, roasted chicken and herbs, broth type soup.  Was delicious!!  I also got the Cashew Chicken Salad sandwich.  Was outstanding.  I really enjoyed it all.

They're not cheap, and expect to drop $30-40 at least, but it's well worth it!!"
F1PMcEIg-FHZvwhiUoFEgw,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"We visited the Scottsdale Quarter location and this pizza is so good.  Had extra cheese and meatball and it was hot and delicious!  Great vibe, and fast, friendly service.  The location is new so everything is clean and the staff is sparkly - great brand execution.  Will return many more times."
_qKen2vDGWw11k71ibJ1Yw,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"Just a pop-in for a cocktail and really loved the vibe and feel.  Started with excellent service, were greeted promptly with a smile and received drinks and menus.  I had a well poured cocktail and my guest enjoyed a very cold beer.

The happy hour menu was varied so you could enjoy price breaks on liquor and beer.  The food also looked excellent but as I mentioned, we had to run but I wish we had more time for food.

Next time, as I highly recommend this North Scottsdale spot if you are in the area!"
Ly2ShApiomYZwKehwb7eRA,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,4,"This is a hidden gem.  Had the sashimi lunch combination and received an ample selection and amount of sushi.  It was the sort of sashimi you would expect to receive in a high-end sushi bar.  Service was great.

The only drawback is that the restaurant is small, and that it fills up quick, so you may have to wait for your table.  But the wait is well worth it!"
-DrDzpZaMrNnH55ZVyTXRQ,w_BhXT6VWZz7I-D_XffUaw,5,"We've been extremely fortunate to have been on a great run with restaurants.  It seems that some restaurants understand that summer is the time to impress guests.  I've read the prior reviews but my experience is that Black Chile has really worked hard since opening to address early complaints.  I am thrilled that we went.

The staff is stellar.  Since they just opened,  our server walked us through the menu and suggested that we start with the black olive and chorizo cheese crisp, and it was delicious.  Please request the avocado-tomatillo salsa and apply liberally to ALL food items - spicy and full of flavor.

My friend ordered the fish tacos (snapper) and was thrilled with the flavor, also loved the rice and beans.  (Homemade tortillas).  I had the chicken enchiladas and highly recommend the green sauce.  So good.

Too full for dessert, but definitely next time.  Gotta go again!!"

On a positive note, Twin Peaks restaurants out of Dallas is taking over the space.  So, I look forward to trying the new restaurant, and bid farewell to Earls and hope they figure out a way to reopen in Scottsdale."

Pizza had a good amount of cheese and not too much sauce.

Wings were just standard. Nothing too special about them

Chicken alfredo was good but only had enough room for a couple bites.

Anyways, in review. Good, but not great."

I a certain employee would stop making so much noise behind the counter when he is cleaning out something with every drink. He slams the metal thing against the counter. If he didn't, this place would def get 5 stars."

Good selection of many Asian rim foods
Sushi was made by the same guy who does the stir fry grill, kinda bounces back and forth
When I did go to get some Sushi, it looked like a bomb went off there, then he cleaned up
The cold shrimp was not de-veined, and had the tell tale black poo strip on the back
Food was decent enough if you took the time to really look at what was just put out
Dessert was picked over with only a few pieces of each, they did not refill while I was there
The Ice Cream station scoop was sitting in a pool of dirty water
Dinner was $11.90 with water

This is a hit or miss place in my opinion. I will not go back. Good Luck."

There may be more expensive hamburgers out there in the market place, but none will beat the made to order, fresh daily produce, nothing frozen, tasty flavor of In-N-Out. Thanks"

Two taco plate lunch special - ground beef was boring and bland, taco shells not so good
Rice - Did not eat - not appetizing to me
Beans - Not bad, had yellow cheese on them, edible

Service was first rate - Amy is a rock star.

So So lunch. I would not order the two taco lunch again.

Waiter was the best: friendly, slight flirt, busy but did not forget me, checked back 4 times.

I ordered the Belgian waffle with bacon and a side of eggs. Perfect meal. The waffle was so light and fluffy. The syrup was real maple. Eggs cooked perfect. Bacon well seasoned/peppered/smoked. I could have eaten a full slab of it.

Each super hot and fresh from the fryer bite made me smile. The crunchy delicious skin and the juicy chicken are the best I have had, other than Moms home cooking.

My favorite sides so far are the cornbread and the sweet potatoes. Both were sweet and delicious.

Saw a couple of the AZ Cardinal players in there enjoying a meal the last time I stopped by. Go Cards!!

Will be going back soon."
EdPpsG0GujcVefs3ANGEGA,cwvH2SZgFkB0HCgB3H7cdA,5,"Had this pizza 5 times now and it continues to be consistent and fresh tasting every time. One of the best pizzas I have had. The sauce on the pizza, light crunchy crust and high quality ingredients are so good. I highly recommend this friendly, family owned establishment in Mesa.

The pizza is the star, 5 stars. Had one with pepperoni and fresh cut mushrooms. There was just the right amount of homemade sauce on a crunchy, yet chewy crust. The cheese was great and spices were just right. Affordable pricing for the quality we received.

Super friendly and helpful owners. We look forward to the continued improvements to the front of the house. We love to support a family owned, local business. Hope everyone else does too!"
qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ,cwvH2SZgFkB0HCgB3H7cdA,5,Chicken Parmesan is delicious. The owner came by and was very friendly. Noodles in the fettuccine Alfredo tasted homemade. Next time we will try the pizza too! Highly recommend.
WWTQUb_NUAd5Q_k7jq2r0A,cwvH2SZgFkB0HCgB3H7cdA,5,"Been by this small corner plaza many times and had no idea that this hidden gem was there. It's tucked way back in the corner, but was well worth finding.

The gentleman who helped me was very friendly and helpful in going over the menu and available selections. I went with the Cubano and the chicken pot pie. Both were flaky and delicious.

I'll definitely be going back to try more of their menu options."
LBAkHJJfCoDj9aa5sc0Mxw,cwvH2SZgFkB0HCgB3H7cdA,2,"Friendly staff. Juicy, big, signature burger. Positives end there. Freestyle machines not working like you would expect as the sodas were under carbonated. Ice wasn't dispensing. Warm coke Isn't the best. Like others have said, the  fries were soooo salty. I had the Parmesan ones. Throw in a few too many unclean tables. Many other burger places do a better job for me to go back. Hopefully they can improve for those who do choose to give them a try."
LzF235KwLnVPDfSqdeZi-A,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,5,"Best shawerma in the city bar none. Excellent french fries, too. One of their Greek salads with
pita bread and shawerma is the best lunch for miles around."
ii_OxGUbtwd3S0RUW9OTvA,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,3,"Had a take-out lunch from here a few weeks ago (beef shawerma) and although it took far too long to prepare, the sandwich was pretty tasty. Took my family to dinner here recently and the chicken shawerma and the gyro plate were quite good and very reasonably priced. Service, though, was uncertain and slow. I'm pleased to see them in the neighborhood and hope that they stick around. Whether they can do so depends, I suspect, on whether they can get their service issues addressed."
YaEPtPnEqh3WSsGq7cL44Q,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"I've dined here many times, and the food is outstanding. Best beef chow fun in the Valley, so far. I've been afraid to try the place lately - speedy service has never been this place's strong suit, and I suspect that a certain grubby local rag's (rhymes with Spew Slime) Best of Phoenix Award 2011 for in the Chinese Restaurant category, while well-earned, has made a not-good situation even worse. Still, once I judge that the excitement and interest generated by the award has died down, I'll be back. Be sure to ask for the 'Chinese' menu, if you've a taste for the less-mainstream. Check the schedule - IIRC the place is closed Thursdays. Their eggrolls are a must - large and succulent. Large portions and very reasonably priced."
7MeMGh0SUlF-GuTyruwtcw,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"Bland, uninteresting and uninspiring calzones, and at $12-13 apiece, a poor value. I won't patronize this place again - subsidizing mediocrity merely perpetuates it."
Todrg1F247iuDIm784XHfA,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Food is above average, ambiance is good, service is attentive, prices seem quite reasonable. Best wor wonton soup I've had in a long time. Excellent little neighborhood place - may they live long, and prosper!"
sBc7xW4BTuY7E4hnIHgSYg,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Stopped in for lunch recently, and ordered the lunch specials. Attentive service, good food (both the kung pao chicken and the szechwan shredded pork were exceptionally tasty), large portions (neither my wife nor I could finish), and very reasonably priced. A good place, and we will certainly revisit when we find ourselves in that 'hood."
CEuIS35iAlIDsx4uVRohXA,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"A little of this place goes a long way. Some of the performers are better than others, I found, and someone should perhaps advise the entertainment committee that what's crude isn't necessarily what's clever. Still, the music and patter seemed to keep the lewd and tattoo'd muffin-tops, of which this place seems to attract a herd,  amused. Not my kinda place, sorry!"
Vw9u6qar1I2QlkQOV6KNVA,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Visited with another couple last night. Good but unremarkable appetizers, OK but not memorable service - that's the down side. Outstanding entrees - for the record, pineapple/chicken curry, pad thai, cashew chicken (#7), basil chicken (#8) - all were delicious. Portion size more than adequate. Our experience caused me yet again to reflect on the term 'crapulent' - that is, the state of feeling uncomfortably bloated as a consequence of overindulgence in the pleasures of the table. It's one of those places where it's difficult to stop eating, even when you know you've had more than enough, 'cause it just tastes so darned good. Some of the best Thai cuisine I've run across in the Phoenix market, I think :-)  ."
0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Seems like Political Junkie and I might be of one mind on this place.

There's food, good food, great food, and good-as-sex food....Sophie's usually produces the latter. One of my top three choices in the Phoenix area. Very reasonably priced for what you get.....similar restaurants in Scottsdale offer half the quality at double the price.

If a particular server ...that would be 'Jodie', a tall redhead....is available, ask her for her recommendation of the specialty of the day. We've done this twice and have been very impressed....the results have been delicious and memorable. Ordering without guidance, though, can be a bit more hit and miss....we've ended up with some mediocre entrees, a couple times.

Well worth the time, travel and expense!"
i3MWkfRgwqPYMKyL9Mk_Pg,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"First visit. Not a particular fan of their spring rolls, but the best pho I've found in the area since the Nam Sao closed. I'll be back."
rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"Stopped in to kill some time for a glass and an appetizer whilst waiting for a movie time. Found the place overpriced - $18 for a grilled vegetable plate of no particular distinction. Really? Service was of the Lower-East-Side-of-NY variety, brusque and a little in your face. Not a pleasant experience."
WHIEI9vdwzDKXdi6H6ZyhQ,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,3,"A go-to neighborhood place for comfort food, hidden away in the Bellair development a few blocks north of Bell Road. An memorable chicken-fried steak (it's got me thinking about how good another would be for Sunday breakfast, but I don't dare - one is indulgence, two is perdition :-) ) and a perfectly acceptable shrimp combo platter. It's the kind of place won't come to mind as a first choice for a meal out - it lacks distinctive character - but seems to serve up reliable, basic American cuisine, at a not unreasonable price. Looks like a good breakfast menu. Deserves better than three stars, but it's not quite up to four. Late hours! - nice, considering that most resto's in the area seem to close pretty early. Saturday night karaoke, starting at ten, if that's to your taste. It's worth a return visit."
mnwRtuVQEsIUomBchu0gwg,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"A very nice selection of microbrews, some of which are really quite good. The food offered doesn't, sadly, even reach the level of mediocrity. I lunched here over the weekend with a party of four; all of us ordered something different, and none were particularly palatable in anyone's opinion. My Waldorf salad wrap resembled and tasted like something that you'd buy wrapped in cellophane at a gas station rest stop for considerably less than the $10 menu price. Nice outside dog-friendly patio, but be aware that on a nice day the wait for a table may take quite a while - we were told 45 minutes. Nah....maybe for a beer, but never again for a meal. I'll not waste my time and money with this place when there are plenty of other better choices around."
RPO5ISR18Xllgk9ahdPepA,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"My wife and I had reservations there last night.  Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience.

Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!

I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice.

The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered.

My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff.

I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved.

Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong.

The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours.

I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.

The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either.

To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that ""the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished"". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.

This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered.

Sorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience."
HV3Q2JYwK9AvMHPYXcxzag,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Good place. Someone here on Yelp recommended the sui gow soup (lookin' at you, Sylvia L.), of which I'd never heard, and both milady wife and I found it delicious. That brings up another point - that soup doesn't appear on the standard menu. Apparently they have a Chinese menu hidden away somewhere, which isn't usually offered to us haole customers. I'll ask for it next time.

Good Singapore rice noodles, good dry beef chow fun. I didn't think much of the tangerine peel beef. I'm always looking for above-average Asian resto's in my neighborhood, and this seems to be one of the better ones. Good and attentive service - the server seemed to recognize us, which, given that we're not in frequently, surprised me.

I wish that they were open for dinner - daily closure at 5PM seems a little eccentric for a restaurant, but I suppose that they know their own business best.

The neighborhood seems to be getting a little sketchy - the influence of the nearby light rail, coupled with proximity to the canal? There's an abandoned business, as of this writing, next door to the Silver Dragon that seems to be becoming a gathering point for homeless folks."
IWF6pgOPF7gNBOJqL8AaXQ,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"You think that a meth habit is hard to beat? Then don't try this place's pho sate or its curry stew (best with French bread, I think). We've found them to be incredibly addictive. Every week or two my bride and I become consumed with pho-lust and absolutely must pay this place a visit. Start off with their number 8 - roll-your-own Vietnamese spring rolls, best with pork, I think. Nice little neighborhood place, not much for ambiance, but the food definitely keeps us coming back. Good service, too."
CQDJ2y9sLxc0HfwNO5R3Ew,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"We dined there when they first opened and weren't thrilled - mediocre at best. But we did decide to give the place another chance this weekend past, and we're glad we did. A very nice pho, and milady wife enjoyed her noodle dish very much. Service was a bit distracted - they were quite busy, and it was hard to get a refill on my Coke - but not so much that it ever rose to the level of annoyance. I don't think that the place rises to the utter delish-ness of the old Avina's, but it's still pretty good :-) . We'll be back."
67Dl9MQcSUNU0OqgsaFs_w,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,5,"Dined there last night with family & friends, and I believe this to be the best pizza I've yet found in the Phoenix area. Wonderfully light yet chewy crust. Awesome (and, unlike the general population, that's not a term I use lightly) extra-crispy wings. Bit of a dive, I think, but if it offers pizza & wings of this quality, who cares? :-)"
bRZSm_1UQdmU6QWZfO9h6w,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,3,"This isn't food, one might hear said in reference to veggie/vegan restaurants; this is what food eats. Not the case for the Loving Hut. Clean, attractive surroundings, friendly and professional staff, and delicious food, at least the first time around. My wife and I stopped in for lunch, and found the fare delicious, four or even five star standard. Not so lucky a week or so later, when we came in for dinner and ordered virtually the same things - two star at best. Different chef on duty, perhaps? Bummer - bitter are the expectations that, once established, are unmet. We'll give it another try, though - perhaps the second experience was the aberration."
Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Excellent food, attentive service,very reasonable prices. What's not to like? Well, the table at which we were seated needed a bit of attention to its cleanliness. Otherwise I would have seriously considered five stars. But that was minor; I'll be back at first opportunity."
h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Dined here last night. The food was very good indeed (lamb kurma, chicken saag, and a few other dishes), well presented and quite flavorful without being overwhelming....five stars! The servers were not up to that standard, sadly...they were certainly inexpert and seemed inexperienced. I'll be back though. The annoyance of bumbling service was far outweighed by the quality of the delicious food."
iZMdwe0xebE3rF0x3LOr4w,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"A damned good sandwich for very reasonable money, I thought, and milady wife enjoyed her salad/noodle bowl, too....very definitely makes this place one of the go-to joints in the 'hood for a quick, cheap and tasty lunch. No pho here, if that's for what you're lookin', though. Tell me....with all the interesting and varied flavors and cuisines on the table (literally) in this town, how do places like Subway and Burger King keep people's interest?"
pImcSPg5tEkuvqHF7JnpoQ,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"Three stars for the food. Fresh ingredients, well prepared, though more attention to the sauces would have earned a fourth star. The place's real shortcoming came with the service - perfunctory at best, the young man in charge went through the motions but still managed to communicate the impression that there was somewhere else he'd rather be and that he didn't give much of a damn on way or another."
cq6SQkWKVT3TH-6YzGFn4g,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,5,"A great lunch spot. A simple, unpretentious, clean and well presented place, a little off the beaten path but not hard to find. Had the gyro salad and the original gyro with fries. Large and tasty portions, friendly and helpful staff. For what more can one ask, for a quick and inexpensive lunch?"
ONyDFp4eO9T_igeM2wdiMQ,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,1,"The cook here certainly believes in baking stuff until it's truly good & dead, and the result was almost everything we ordered - pizza, wings, fries - was heated, heated and heated to the point of leathery tastelessness and indigestibility. The 'train-wreck' fries were overbaked to the point of requiring a bit of scraping to separate them from the plate; the wings were crispy but suffered from next-to-no saucing. At this moment, eleven hours later, I'm still in a state of digestive distress, sliding between crapulence and dyspepsia; it takes some real gut-bombing to produce THAT effect!  A great disappointment, given that I'd patronized this establishment before and found it's cuisine to be not stellar but acceptable.

A wall-mounted speaker right over our table blasted out hip-hop favorites, with the rawest of lyrics replete with 'n*gga' this and 'p*ssy' that and 'f*ck'' everything else, loud enough after ten pm  to make conversation at our table difficult. Y'know, musical tastes differ, but if you're taking Mom out, or have young kids in tow, you may want to find a place a bit more family-friendly. This ain't Peter Piper, for sure.

The server was on the ball, fast and attentive - about the only thing this place had going for it. Our pizza order was botched at the kitchen level; he did make best-effort to make it right, but by that time we were hungry enough to be willing to compromise our preferences in favor of just eating.

""We draw a diverse crowd after 10PM"" was the server's excuse for the playlist (though I didn't take his point; the crowd seemed to be exclusively gen-Z and millennial-aged white working-class lads). It's now a bit less diverse, because this is one batch of over-50s who will be taking their custom elsewhere. Too bad, 'cause I've liked the place in the past; but this particular experience qualifies as a disaster."
JfHXzulF6yIKgA22YYPedw,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Our first visit. A nice place with a charming al fresco patio - a good place to take out-of-town visitors for a Southwestern experience. Since it's on the Dreamy Draw cycling route and very close to the Arizona Canal cycling path, a fine place to stop and lunch if one's on a ride in the area. The flour chips and salsa were delicious, the fish tacos and the pollo fundido were yum, and ice cold Modelo amber is on tap! Service was fast and attentive - my one complaint is that while a bottle of cold water hit the table immediately, water glasses never did appear.  I suspect that milady wife and I will become regular clients. Food - three and a half stars, service four, and ambience a solid five."
1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"We found the food to be subpar and wildly overpriced (c'mon, guys, fifteen to twenty bucks for an entree that goes for $8 to $12 at most other places?). Bland, uninteresting lettuce wraps; mango chicken on the bitter side; Singapore street noodles that would never have made it in Singapore except perhaps as fodder for livestock. How this place established such a favorable reputation is quite beyond me - no one in our party was a bit impressed.

Service was the high point of the visit. Our gal was was totally on the ball, fast, friendly and professional. But outstanding service doth not a successful outing make, and I have no plans to return. There are so many other interesting Asian places around for so much less money."
8xyRFdmF_9boBaPx0jBhHQ,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,2,"Good pizza - my daughter seemed quite pleased with her personal veggie - but I found the pasta dishes dismal. My linguine seemed to have been cooked, frozen and  then reboiled at the point of order, garlic insufficiently toasted. Yeech. I might go back for the pizza, but I'll certainly avoid the other dishes. I thought the place overpriced for what it was, too - $15-$20 entrees in a basic, unpretentious neighborhood place. Surprisingly good house cabernet sold by the carafe. Friendly if somewhat inexpert service."
UdoPZY4bjbE92mtReIEm5Q,AhNmTJt3HKsNemyLMZeG6Q,4,"Best Irish Sunday breakfast buffet in town...bit pricey (adult: $18) but so worth it, and one that certainly can lead one to sinful gluttony. The Irish sausage and the creamed salmon are the real deal. Polite, attentive and yet not intrusive service. Five stars were the dessert selections a bit more interesting (note to management, if they're reading: sherry trifle!). But truth be told, you'd have to be a trencherman or -woman of truly heroic appetite to feel the need for a closing course of sweet after a swoop on this buffet. Plan for a post-prandial hour or two to devote to reflection and digestion after a Sunday morning at Johnny Fox's."
64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,4,"After hearing about Gallo Blanco for a while from foodie and chef friends, as well as Yelpers, we decided to give it a go last night as we were picking our son up at the airport later in the evening. We walked in and immediately liked the vibe and diversity in ages and types of people in the room. It immediately gave you a ""you are welcome to come in and hang out"" feel. We were greeted quickly by our server, Mary. Her slightly edgy look fits the urban scene but is quickly belied by her sweet nature. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions. We started with Micheadas (BM style) and they were just right. The spice, the flavor of the fresh lime and the bloody mary with the beer was delish and many diners were ordering them. We had a mix of the street tacos- halibut, shrimp, carne asada and pork. Loved the carne asada. My hubby loved the shrimp but just wished there was more than one in it! The corn on the cob with cojita chesse and paprika, JUST STOP IT! It was so good and hubby doesn't normally eat corn but he loved it too. THE BEST! We will definitely be coming back! It was fun, the food was excellent and the service was personal and FUN!"
fI9ErCUGY8rXRPBbatcxMA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"A wonderful date night at our favorite spot in town. We opted to sit at the long counter this time to watch the action. It was cool. The only issue is that the seats were a bit tight for Big Daddy to get really comfortable and we were pretty far from the action (my fault for calling at the last minute). I loved sitting there because I like the social aspects of a community spot and it was great fun. Food was exquisite as ever (menu to follow below). We both noticed that Chef Josh (always a charmer) is placing even more emphasis on front of the house interaction. EVERYONE LOVES THAT! It makes it fun and he is so informative that the food goes to another level.
BIg Daddy and my menus combined:
Amuse bouche- passion frruite gren tea w/kiwi pudding (good, but sweet for us)
Celery root sout w/pumpkin seed oil- DIVINE
Cucmber, watermelon, red radis, goat cheese salad
Kumamoto Oyster- ponzu soy, chive
Loup de mer w/eggplant mash- YUMMY
Foie Gras-BIG DADDY SAID IT IS THE BEST THING EVER. He was swooning and he doesn't ever swoon that much unless I cook! (ulterior motive, but that's another story :))
Kangaroo w/ creamy white polenta- Kangaroo was good- a bit firmer than we expected and the polenta complimented it beautifully.  A lovely protein course.
Veal sweet breads- zucchine noodls, shishito peppers and bacon consumme- LOVE THIS- We requested sweetbreads because we lust for them and these were delicious. Chef even gave us tips on how to make them at home (no small feat)
The Cheese Course- always prefer savory over sweet - Epoisses de Bourgogne, humbolt fog (hubby's fave) and robiola SUPERB!

The meal was absolutely wonderful. Experience was romantic, fun. No wonder they are always packed in this economy. LOVE IT!"
6nKR80xEGHYf2UxAe_Cu_g,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Well, appearances do not always tell the story. Nondescript from the outside, the completely transformed Tom Thumb's market is AWESOME. For two weekends in a row, we have walked (yes, walked) there for breakfast. My hubby had been raving about the caprese sandwich (at a gas station?), the cubano and the bbq. We had 'pigs and grits' for breakfast (we split it- huge serving) and it was divine. Beautiful pulled pork smothered in Low Country bbq sauce over creamy grits! Delicious. The following week we split a smoked turkey egg white omelet. It was equally good. Priced well and quite a surprise. The people are very friendly and we will be back. We were so glad this gas station and carwash re-opened. The car wash is professional. When I took my car in for a hand wash, I asked for how long it would take. They told me and hit the time on the dot with no hardsell for other things. Great experience."
_XN-GwzZwAyIqLKJsl2htg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Big Daddy and I came back for Happy Hour. Awesome as the first time.  Sat at the bar with Jeremy, who was slinging drinks, recommending food and chatting up customers better than Tom Cruise in Cocktail ( he is not old enough to know that movie.:). We had Chicharron de pollo with Miso Mustard.  The miso mustard balanced the crispy chicken.  Next was Rock Shrimp Tempura with a truffle aioli that we loved.  The secret sauce, In house made Mango Habanero sauce that Jeremy shared kicked it up a notch.  Finally we ended with the Chinese Style Crab Garlic Noodles.  Foodie food for sure.  Delicately composed, with a nice depth in flavor.  The garlic was surprisingly subtle, but there.  The spice was just right.  A dish we will order again! We will be back!  Atmosphere is crowded but bearable. We will be back!"
roR1_DDlMk7mhi5_R6XVKA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Wow!  This was a great addition to North Scottsdale! We were greeted by Pat, a lovely first impression friendly person.  We recognized many people who worked at other restaurants!  Friendly and welcoming with sophisticated food. !  Joey Maggiore has outdone himself.  Went in today for a day off brunch. Ruby red grapefruit mimosas started things right!  The vibe is comfortable, classy and light. They will be packed on weekends. Food is hands down awesome. Our daughter had the fluffy kids pancakes made with dark chocolate chips!  She loved it and so did hubby. I had the Pork Carnitas hash. It is unlike any before. Slow cooked sumptuous pork with egg, hash, green chili, avocado and crispy onions. A MUST order dish!  Hubby ordered leg of lamb hash. First he braises the lamb for hours. For savory breakfast lovers who rarely see lamb on the menu...swoon!  Layered also with a nice dusting crispy leeks and eggs. The cheddar biscuit was light as air. And the finale was donut cannoli with ricotta and fresh fruit. Made fresh to order, they were airy and light and divine!
We will be back this weekend when we can linger. Vincent our server was super at explaining the menu!

fbU7gHEG5A-cFxH33ouQ4A,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"We are pleased to be the first reviewers of Mia Francesca. DC Ranch has been needing something different and we finally have it! This charming Italian restaurant, owned by a privately held larger company, feels like a locally owned restaurant. The restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We were immediately greeted by Lori, the catering manager who was kind and engaging. We met our server, the tall and statuesque Dora, and the meal began.She knows the menu completely and had recommendations.  The price points were reasonable- one diner nearby said, ""FINALLY, we have a GO TO restaurant here with the right price point that isn't based around a bar."" This is a charming restaurant and the food was exceptional. I am Italian and never would have guessed this is a chain. Beginning with the wine, the price points were reasonable. I would suggest a ""house wine"" carafe price for a red and a white and watch them sell like crazy. Wine snobs won't buy them, but regular people will......

Next came the delectable bread with the house-made extra virgin olive oil infused with fresh herbs. DIVINE. Dora warned us it was addictive and she was right.

Big Daddy ordered the spaghetti bolognese as he is a self-professed conneisseur and he loved it. It was rustic, with three different meats; fresh tomatoes; carrots; onions; and other sumptious items cooked for 8 hours. We are really picky about bolognese and I intend to order it next week. AWESOME. He asked for linguine and it was given! They have a whole wheat option (Big Daddy is big on fiber :)) and they only had a penne. Good choice, but they should consider a whole wheat spaghetti or linguine for people who want it.

Our Maximillian (14) loved the spaghetti with tomato sauce. I tasted it with a cook's palette and it was light, perfectly seasoned and good. I would order it myself for sure.

I had the Spinach ravioli. The ravioli was clearly house-made and the spinach stuffing was delicious. The tomato cream sauce and fresh spinach on top were great, only needing a few red pepper flakes (which I received upon request) to balance the dish out.

Dessert was tiramusu and flourless chocolate cake with chocolate peppermint ice cream. They were both delicious but the tiramusu won the day.

Finally, we met Jeff Cohen, Director of Operations for the West Coast for this organization. A lofty title that we are sure is well deserved. Most importantly, to us, he seemed like the sole proprietor of a local joint. That was the best. We came to find out that his daughter, goes to our son's school. A small world. He clearly takes personal pride in opening these restaurants. We would sure like to see more of him.

Thank you for a great new restaurant in our neighborhood!

Laurie, Rodney and Maximillian Malone"
PRUsjqm4hWbmmI_lgj6hzg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,4,"New spot from Arcadia!  Friendly staff. The Burger was delish.  Cheesy goodness w/ onions, cheese, and a double burger. Hubby had the sonoran hotdog which he liked. Our daughter had the chicken tinga taco.  And then ordered another. Fries were good by their report and we liked the mexican corn.  Ron, the GM, has a great personality!  We will be back!"
AOEjA6yCT2htzQCfbPy7vA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Okay, we finally got it. A family friendly, upscale restaurant in DC Ranch that we can walk to! Lush Burger is a fast, casual, yet very upscale new burger concept in DC Ranch. We tried it tonight- went early since they are slammed (shows the demand for affordable, family dining.). You walk into a LUSH (yes, lush, very plush) red and stainless restaurant that is whimsical and very comfortable at the same time. You walk up, order your food and they deliver it to your table. With an extensive menu at affordable price points, we were intrigued. Hubby and I selected lushburger classics with various accoutrements. I had mine ""skinny style"" with no bun and butter lettuce instead. Our 12 year old ordered the kids 2 baby lushburgers and he loved the veggie option instead of fries. Big Daddy had to try both the truffle fries (divine) and onion rings (crispy and delicious, NO GREASE!) The wine and beer offerings were affordable and fun. You can reorder at your table and don't have to get back in line (which gets fairly long). Our son's chocolate shake was frozen heaven and he licked it all out! The Harris Ranch burgers were moist and cooked perfectly. They were nice sized (important to hubby) and juicy. Next time, he will go for the wings. There is a nice variety of salads, ahi tuna burgers and turkey burgers but we wanted to start with the basics for the first visit. People were having fun and the outside patio was a happening hot spot for sure. Children were more than welcome and the owners were present and meeting guests. They were looking for feedback (important on only a few days open) and were creating a fun vibe. We will definitely be back. Lots of fun and we walked off dinner on the 20 minute walk home! Laurie, Rodney and Maximillian Malone"
PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,4,"Hubby and I stopped in at Fez quite by accident last Thursday. Have been hearing about it for months but were in the area and happened upon it. I must say we enjoyed the whole experience. First we must start with the gspot special drink. I am normally a wine drinker, not swayed by sweet foo foo drinks. This one was on special ($3) and caught our eye due to the ""made from fresh pink grapefruit"" description. DIVINE. We both enjoyed it. Then we moved on to split the pasta special with shrimp and veggies and white wine sauce. Sounds like every other pasta dish in town, but the flavors were exceptional. We were both mopping up the sauce. The wait staff was adorable and friendly and it made for a lovely experience. Will definitely go back soon!"
qxNKPJfuklMxwPbkHLHeWQ,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"My hubby and I had an exceptional lunch here today. We enjoyed great food, excellent wine and superb service. Mike G. and his manager (sorry did not get his name) went above and beyond to explain menu choices, ensure that everyone was done to perfection. We started with the Mushroom Soup, which was sublime. It was, by far, the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted. The table next to us said the same thing. Then I had the brick chicken (swoon) and hubby had the smoked pastrami sandwich. He is STILL talking about it. Instead of fries, he opted for brussel sprouts and I thought he was going to lick the plate. The service and ambiance are a cut above. We will be back within a week or so.
AWESOME!"
YFqlMM1tFn0C4b9aHdzOgg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"We have always gone to the one on Thunderbird, which is nice. We decided to check this one out (family owned also) and met Angelo, this owner. The ambiance is beautiful and our server, Christian, was knowledgeable about the food and the wine. Great experience. But the real kudos go the wonderful food. Our daughter ate her spaghetti bolognese and as I am Italian, we are pretty much connossiors of good bolognese. It was divine. My husband had the Cioppino (white) and almost picked up the bowl to slurp the juice (thankfully, he stopped himself. :)) The plentiful, fresh seafood combined with the briny, sumptuous sauce was absolutely awesome. He is still raving about it. But my dish was the best on the table- I had a sole petrale with gorgeous, crispy mixed vegetables and a wild mushroom risotto that made us swoon. My hubby doesn't like risotto, but he LOVED this one. Then on to dessert- they have a ""chocolomissou."" I don't eat dessert, but it was delicious. And we had two ice creams- salted carmel (just loved it) and girlie had the vanilla.

All in all, a great fine dining find in Fountain Hills. There is no other restaurant like this in the area. We were in Amalfi last year and the food rivaled Italy's.

We will be back next week for sure! BRAVO!

F73T-N5lRNL2Gcpg0Q4KKw,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Big Daddy and I had a wonderful date night Saturday at Fat Ox. We have enjoyed Chef Matt's other ventures- The Mission and Zinc Bistro for years. This was a completely different experience and we also loved it. The atmosphere almost made you feel as if you were in San Francisco or somewhere else wonderful. Beautiful space, open air, all of it. Jennifer and Anthony made our dining experience excellent. Attentive, yet not hovering, allowing us to take our time and enjoy the experience.
Anthony made a great table side caesar that we shared. It was delicate and delicious. The white anchovies made it really special. My hubby does a great caesar and this one has him beat.
We next enjoyed the white truffle, speck garganelli. SWOON! Absolutely lick your spoon delicious.
We also enjoyed the Filet with the Porcini sauce. It was appropriately crispy on the outside, mid rare inside (perfect) and we loved it.
We  were too full for dessert.
We felt it was the most enjoyable meal out in a very long time and will be back. We will try a whole new set of tastes next time."
Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,1,"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables."
B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"My hubby and I are self- proclaimed ""Foodies."" We loved Chef James at Tapino and were thrilled when we found out they were opening this. As many others have stated the atmosphere is charming and cozy. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends. We have had dinner and brunch now and both were excellent! The Vicchysoisse (hard to find in Phoenix, the hottest city in the country) is superb as is the Steak Frites. Tradtional french, just like Paris. For brunch, it was the salmon pappilotte (delicious) and beignets (for our 11 year old) and a different twist on eggs benedict for hubby. Really wonderful and authentic. We are bringing our college son in this weekend for Croque Monsieur. Chef James and lovely host Wendy have hit the nail on the head this time. Laurie and Rodney"
zuVvDYJkKAbXQTTBauAqJQ,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"We love this Over Easy. The food is fresh and delicious. I especially like the egg white and aspargus omelette. Our 22 yr old son loves the WOlf pack and our 13 yr old like the chocolate pancake. Big Daddy and I often share the lox and onions with egg whiles. DIVINE.

Betsy as the new GM has made a tremendous improvement in the atmostphere and fun of the place. Sam is a great server and they run a well oiled machine. They know their regulars and they take care of them. Eat there once or twice a week. Love it!"
2V5ZcFDQzv1MN-31eMVhZQ,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Hot Dog Stop is a new concept at the Scottsdale Promenade, owned by Lillian and Guy, purveyors of the Cafepino at Scottsdale 101. Hot Dog Stop features gourmet hotdogs including tons of possible combinations and special hotdogs. Every menu item is fresh and carefully created. The owners created the diverse menu and feature creative condiments and fun sides including fried mushrooms and zucchini in addition to the more standard fare of fries. The hotdogs are the stars here  and they are rapidly expanding their client base. The menu has every possible permutation of traditional and new hotdogs including turkey dogs for the health conscious. Even the buns are light as air and stand in second position to the wonderful dogs. This is an excellent value as well with gourmet plates including coleslaw and a pickle at $4.75. They seem to be right on target with a new, innovative concept (creative hotdogs) in a quick serve lovely lunch environment. Fresh pastries adorn the counter including sample of side dishes to entice diners to try new things. The food was excellent and a good choice for a very economical fresh cooked lunch! Laurie and Rodney Malone"
H7_yu7MgzSXB0vb959yXdA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,4,"Great vibe when you walk in. It feels like a happening Scottsdale hotspot and it is. You walk in the place is literally pulsing with music and people (all ages). We were ushered into a quiet room and greeted by Tory, who recommended the VIP specialty cocktail. Hubby had one and it was delicious- a pineapple infused vodka martini. Normally not my thing but it was good. We chose our entrees and a nice bottle of Schug cab-merlot blend that was reasonably priced. For dinner, hubby had the chicken schnitzel- sounds funny at a steak house but he loved it. It was pounded thin and covered in zucchini accents on pappardelle. Yummy, but too big for me! :) I had my dream dinner- a beautiful medium rare cooked strip steak over a delicious salad with arugula, blue cheese, lettuce, baby tomatoes and a lemon vinagrette. Absolutely perfect. It was accented by two deviled eggs that my husband immediately whisked off of my plate. Finally, the meal was completed with a chocolate bread pudding and adult milkshake, which was not too sweet. All in all, a great experience and we will be back. The service, starting with Tory and complemented by the bussers, was superb. Great job!"
Ac7C2H4E363qVQEHpONLLw,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,4,"Hubby and I had an opportunity to head out for some happy hour fun. I decided we should try Narcisse. We walked into the beautiful space and immediately felt the weekend was here! We decided to sit at the bar and get to know the place. We were happily surprised to find that Happy Hour included $5 champagne by the glass. It was Domaine St. Michelle, and tasted just fine. We ordered fried pickles (delicious) and the beef carpaccio, which was divine. We then asked the charming owner, Todd,"
HO5cfgdnn13z-7sDSgrWkg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Hubby and I were excited to try Taco Haus as we are big fans of Brat Haus. Anything Payton does is going to be done fresh and excellent. We started with the halibut ceviche. It was light and flavorful.The Asian preparation was great for the fish. Hubby ordered the pork belly tacos and asked for the house made salsas to add spice. He said that he is ordering the same dish again. I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken. The skin was thin and crispy (the way I like it) and the inside juicy and mouthwatering. Hubby had to help me eat it as they was so much there. Two delicious sides came with it- my favorite was the street corn topped with spicy popcorn and 13 beans slow cooked with pork belly (Big Daddy's favorite.) The drinks were fairly priced and the tres leches dessert literally melts in your mouth. The servers were friendly and well informed; the atmosphere is ""joint like"" with great music- makes you want to hang out for a while. This Saturday we are bringing our whole crew in for lunch to try more things."
aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"La Torretta is our family favorite for Italian food. Darius, the owner, does a terrific job of remembering everyone's favorites or customizing to your desires that day. Our kids love the gnocchi bolognese and we love all of the fish entrees. The smoked chicken pasta is fabulous and I have even taken it to parties to rave reviews. Everything is fresh and fabulous. If you like OssoBucco, this is the best in town! Laurie and Rodney and the Boys"
OXyPh_Jm159lwMlebtDeeg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Time for an update. On a seemingly quiet Monday evening, we were in the mood for good chinese food. On the way to Jade Palace last evening, I said to my hubby and son,"" I am SO in the mood for shellfish. I hope they have it on the menu tonight."" To our delight and surprise, there was a softshell crab appetizer (delicious cooked with jalapenos) and a full lobster prepared in ginger and scallion sauce. Hubby and I split the divine lobster and it was reasonably priced- $36 for 1 3/4 pounds. Our son ordered the Yang Chow Fried rice (a family favorite) and everyone was happy. Manager Hugh (cousin of the owner) always makes everyone welcome and happy."
9JyyXlFBHCdoP6TRQ3cqbA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"We really enjoyed this new brew pub. It starts at good when you get fried pickles that barely have a breading on them and are deliciously briny and decadent with a cucumber dill sauce to accompany. We split the burger (going out that night) and it was divine- especially the cheese curds on top. With a luscious challah bun, roasted tomatoes and a garlic aioli, it was delicious. We sampled a couple of beers and they are great! It has a nice bright atmosphere and the service was great. Welcome to Scottsdale for sure! We will be back. Laurie and Rodney Malone"
sPzLsm3l1eUPMzz3ZJJu_w,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"We wandered into Athena after a movie and were graciously greeted even though we came in the back door! The friendliness of the staff made an inviting start to the evening. Our server, Angelo, acted like an owner. He is greek; knows the menu intimately and was very warm and friendly. We started with the grape leaves (dolmodes) which my hubby normally loves and I only tolerate. THESE WERE DELICIOUS loaded with lamb and rice and a warm, lemony sauce. BEST EVER! Our son had the kid's steak kebobs (chargrilled and sumptious) and we split the night's special- the braised lamb over greek spaghetti. My hubby is a big eater and there was still plenty to take home. The owner came over and introduced himself and the whole experience felt so removed from so many plastic restaurants in town, it was great and we will be back this week!"
vK1_qKEG7zHvjiTOsN0CRg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"My hubby, daughter and I enjoyed a lovely brunch at Snooze yesterday. We are excited for them to open in Scottsdale, near where we live. I must say the art deco, bright ambiance gives the proper anticipation of a fun meal. I started with an MMMmmm Mimosa which was light and lovely. Carlene, our server, made the entire experience excellent. She even had a whimsical bacon and egg hair clip that she made. Shows you right off the bat, she loves her work. Since it was our first visit she brought us (on her) the pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter. I don't even like sweets, but it was DIVINE! We all scooped it up. Our sweet daughter had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, which she loved. The soup almost tasted like a marinara. Very fresh and delicious. I had the lox, rye, capers, herbed goat cheese, and arugula plate. It was very good. My husband had the corned beef hash. It came out cold and they immediately retired it and made it right. The manager( forgot his name- glasses and a ponytail) did a great job of assuring that it would be perfect the next time.

All in all, we are not going to want to wait until the end of August when Kierland opens so we will be back. BRAVO! Laurie and Rodney Malone"
LHyj66waFlDcw9UToo27JQ,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,1,"We had lunch there yesterday. It was AWFUL! We were doing business after so we didn't want a messy basket, plus they didn't have crawfish. We ordered the gumbo- came out lukewarm- server graciously reheated it but it had 2 shrimp and 2 slices of sausage. It was all soup and rice. We love gumbo and this was disappointing. Then we ordered the soft shell crab. It was so over breaded that you could not taste any crab. By far, the worst we have ever had anywhere. We then decided to try the fried shrimp, again, over breaded and not good.

We paid $40 for the lunch with tip and left very dissatisfied. The food was unappetizing and we had stomach aches all afternoon and evening. We will never go back.

We will go back to Hot and Juicy for sure however. It seems as if this management is distracted away from fish with BBQ."
m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,3,"Stopped in at Chez Vous last week with hubby and son. A lovely place with a definite french feel to the decor. The owner, Isabelle Horvath, is charming and makes everyone feel at home. We had Kir Royales to start which were lovely. Hubby and I ordered Savory Crepes- I had the Roasted Chicken Bress with melted swiss and chive and hubby had the Campage- potato, swiss and prosciutto.  They are made from a large organic buckwheat crepe which was very different in color for AMerican palates. It also did not have the consistency of a traditional crepe but the flavor was good. I would suggest giving people the option of what type of crepe they would like and it would help with some of the other Yelpers' dislike of the buckwheat crepe. I liked it but had had something similar in Paris.Our son had the Tutti Frutti which looked divine- traditional crepes filled with strawberries, banana and blueberries and topped with toasted almonds. It was light, airy and wonderful.We had the Creme Brulee for dessert and it was delish (and I am not a dessert eater). A few menu tweaks (a dressing option other than balsamic or ceasar- maybe a champage vinagrette) and a chance to choose crepes will make this a favorite spot!"
unQWd_INdQowUzCw7HZt9A,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,2,"Javino, as other reviewers say, has all of the right elements- great location; stylish design and a good menu. We have been there more than 3 times and the same issue has ensued each time. SERVICE.  Usually I go with hubby for a quick date lunch but found myself on my own the other day. I decided to give it another go because I love the walleye sandwich (without the bread). I came in, sat down, and it was at least 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Granted they were brisk, but not super busy. Finally I ordered my favorite- walleye sandwich without the bun; grilled instead of deep fried. Server was very unfriendly and said-""the fish just won't work that way."" I said, well I have had it that way on at least 2 other occasions and it was fine. He really kept pushing it but I insisted. I never saw him again until long after the food arrived. The blue cheese on the side salad was divine and the walleye was good but the service will keep me away. They need to understand friendliness."
ndXuzuD4BpNIrm1I0nTsww,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,4,"We have had 3 meals here- twice for brunch and finally, last Sat. for dinner. The atmosphere is fun and funky as other reviewers have noted. It was a great place to bring a couple with us who generally won't venture out of their neighborhood. The brunch menu is good and I had the Pozole both times. DIVINE, and with a nice added twist with the littleneck clams. Nice spice with the serranos and overall a great dish. I almost forgot, we started with the shrimp and avocado creme ceviche. Everyone at the table loved it . Hubby ordered Barbacoa and loved it. My friend had the fish tacos. I had the carne asada tacos. Succulent and just the right size."
2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"Great food and server! Loved our shared chicken tortilla soup. Dear Hubby had blackened salmon over a kale salad. I had a burger, cooked mid rare- just divine with a salad with cilantro dressing. Loved it and the owner was as charming as can be. Our server (Justin?) was knowledgeable about all of the food. We will be back!"
sk2L4KcJbkkF6eHfjitGpg,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"We are HUGE fans of Chef James Porter from his Tapino days. How many Chefs in this Valley or anywhere else have pulled off (successfully, Tapino's- known for its fine cuisine and locavore dinners; Petite Maison (our very favorite) and now Big Earls BBQ, named for James' beloved father) 3 restaurants that are completely different? Chef is a huge fan of offal and so is my hubby. We sampled the fried sweetbreads (very different); bone marrow (DELICIOUS) and the pig's tails (everyone enjoyed them but wanted BBQ sauce instead of ranch dressing). This is a sampling over two weeks- lunch on Sat and dinner tonight. For our evening cuisine, we wanted to sample the ribs (my husband could have eaten them with a spoon- they fell off the bone and I don't like ribs but loved them). The smoke was subtle and the texture wonderful. I had the pulled chicken bbq sandwich, priced at a very reasonable price point and enough food for two people easily. We tried sides of greens; corn bread and potato salad. All were very good fare and a step above most barbeque spots. The vibe is nice; the atmosphere is comfortable and it is a casual, affordable, DIFFERENT type of place in Old Town. YEAH! We need diversity and options. I am not a huge bbq person but was the one pushing to come back tonight. Great food, Chef even worked with Desert Smoke to create the sauces. Delicious! We will be back! Laurie and Rodney Malone"

CDpoJiqgM04wqQTZ6QkTqQ,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"This was our third visit.  The absolute BEST sushi in town.  Tonight was our first opportunity with Happy Hour.   Great value pointed out by Jade, our wonderful server.  We tasted grilled squid, miso black cod ( the definition of Unctuous) and the edamame for the kids.  Fabulous.  Then had the Blind Phoenix for hubby ( I am allergic to tuna) and he loved it.  We asked for tagaroshi on the side and Jade totally got it.  Brendan did a great job running the food.  Our 17 year old son loved the ramen and our 9 year old daughter ate the chicken with ramen noodles. She loved it.

We had salmon and cream cheese and many other roles.  The spider was my favorite.

Josh, the manager spoke to us and appreciated our comments.  A great experience!"
eDlgbI0Qg_mmI-Osvci0gw,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,4,"Sapporo has been a family favorite for years. We had not been in for maybe 6 months or so. It was a really a great experience last night. We were not aware that there are new owners now. Chef Steve Byrne, Director of Culinary Operations for the whole parent company, was attentive to the entire dining room- checking on food prep; diner's experiences and quality. It has definitely paid off.  We started with the new menu item- pork belly- which literally melted in our mouths. Our son, 13 and his best friend loved it too. Then we ordered our family favorite- teppanaki. Hubby had the calamari steak (DIVINE); I had a NY strip and the kids had steak as well. The meal started impressively with the salad made at the table. They have significantly upgraded the salad adding fresh beets and a fresh ginger dressing instead of the pre-made stuff they had formerly. The teppanaki chef did a great job, entertaining everyone and cooking the food perfectly. The only suggestion I have is that I asked for medium rare and I was closer to medium but it was tasty.

BTW, Happy Hour pricing is the way to go. Big discounts on drinks and smaller portioned (but still more than one can eat) teppanaki meals that are affordable and will bring us in more often. Check it out before 7:00 pm
All in all a great experience and we are going back for hubby's birthday on Christmas Eve!"
RGGOEmgtKXXZI91IXHEuIA,3WPLPXt0-N0wyvHpkM3Vhw,5,"My hubby and I hosted a Tasting Dinner last Thursday at Bonefish. The evening kicked off with Chef Michael introducing himself graciously to the table and asking about food sensitivities and allergies. We had two gluten free (one dairy free) and one tuna allergy. He accommodated all of the special requests perfectly. With a table full of foodies, we were set to go!

The evening exceeded our expectations. We were hosting 12 people in the bar for a lovely dinner. We started with a plethora of appetizers including the famous Bang Bang Shrimp (crispy texture with just the right hint of spice in the sauce), Lamb chops (divine- carmelized and mid rare; lollipop size- my husband's hands down favorite app); ahi tuna served sashimi style (one of our friends said it was her favorite for sure); delicate beef potstickers with a nuanced sauce. Chef even improvised and made an gluten free Shrimp Italiano that was delicate yet luscious in flavor.  They were so many delicious apps on the table, we could have called it dinner! All of it was served with a lovely white blend and heavier red wine. Pomegranate martinis were a huge hit as were the fresh pear martinis. Most of us had Uber'ed so everything was flowing nicely!

The fish course, consisting of 4 tasting pieces each was the highlight of the evening for me personally. The first dish was a delicious jumbo shrimp paired with scallops. We also had a fresh salmon in butter sauce (my favorite- it had none of the strong overwhelming flavor that salmon can sometimes have); flame grilled grouper that Hubby LOVED! and finally a lovely sea bass balanced with a fresh mango salsa. Absolutely OUTSTANDING!

The final course was non fish and featured Filet Mignon perfectly cooked with a chimichurri sauce. One of our friends said this was her favorite of the night. Next was ""Lily's Chicken"" which included artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and was SO good. The other hit of the meat course was the pork tenderloin cooked with fresh sage and fontina. It was moist and delicious.

With full bellies, we ordered coffees and Expresso Martini's for some. The Martini drinkers loved them and said they could sip them all night! John, the Managing Partner came out and greeted us at that time and everyone told him how much they enjoyed the meal.

Two of my chocoholic girlfriends almost jumped out of their seats when they saw the trio of desserts- gluten free chocolate brownie with ice cream (have you seen grown women literally SWOON?), key lime pie (one of the choco centric gals said THIS dessert was her favorite) and last but not least a delicious coconut pie- not cream like you usually see- just delicious coconut in a delicate crust.

This review would not be complete without highlighting our awesome server, Joe. He is a true professional and did a fantastic job with keeping up with our lively, demanding table. THANKS JOE! YOU ARE THE BEST!

Bonefish outdid themselves with this awesome evening! A big thank you to Chef Michael and John for their efforts! We had a ball!"

My date suggested that we check the Grind out last night, especially as it was National Cheeseburger Day and they had a $6 special on cheeseburgers (clearly posted on their website to promote the day).   We were seated right away but it was a long wait before someone came to take our drink order.  Finally, the drinks came and we placed our food orders.  My date asked about the cheeseburger special and ordered one, and I ordered the turkey burger.   I asked if I could build my own turkey burger and was informed that it would be absolutely no problem.  After another long wait, my turkey burger came and it was totally wrong, so I sent it back. When they brought my turkey burger back, my date asked for another beer and some mayo.  He was told that they didn't have any mayo.  First, how can you be a burger place without any mayo, and second, my original (bad order) turkey burger came swimming in aioli.  Apparently the restaurant staff is so ignorant about food that they don't realize that aioli is basically a high-end mayo? Duh!  After two more requests, my date finally got his second beer.   At this point we really couldn't wait to leave.  We had to ask for the check twice.  Of course it was wrong--they charged $10 for the $6 cheeseburger special.   Because our server never came back to the table, after about 10 minutes I walked back to the register by the kitchen to ask that the bill be changed.   I waited at least 5 minutes more as they couldn't figure out how to discount the cheeseburger, which was the special for the evening!  (I wonder how many other people got hosed on their check as it seemed we were the first to get the discount.)  Finally someone else came out with the bill and apologized, then asked about our experience.  I was candid and told him that this was one of my worst restaurant visits, ever.   He did comp us $6 towards the beer and gave us a tiny discount, but there is absolutely no way we will ever go back.  And while we like upbeat music, it was heavy metal and extremely loud--not a place to go and unwind after work.  Bad service, mediocre food, and high prices (they charge $1 for cheese on a $10 burger that doesn't include fries).   Next time, we'll go to Blu Burger at Pinnacle Peak & Pima."
Wj_48yqBXHLgkmMh8QYhaA,ENQ_9ftK5TIUuObdjZ5Nsg,2,"Shrimp . . . not deveined, yuck!
Okay, last night my date and I tried Jaspers Peak again (we bought a gift card a while ago and needed to use it).  He had the po' boy with sausage and fries, and would rate it about 3 starts.  I had the shrimp boil and a side of steamed broccoli.  I was totally grossed out to find (a few shrimp in) that they didn't devein the shrimp, even on the main (outside) vein.  I asked for a sharp knife and told the waiter that the shrimp weren't deveined.  He told me that, because they are in the shell, they can't be deveined.  I know this isn't true, having lived on the Gulf Shore for several years.  It is actually quite easy to do--you use kitchen scissors to cut up the back, take the vein out and the shell stays on.  It was gross, and I had to hack up each shrimp with a steak knife to try to get the vein out before eating a little bit of each shrimp.   There are some nice things about this restaurant, but I wouldn't say the food is one of them.  There is no excuse for this!  Gross!"

Went back for our second visit, itching to use a gift card that was soon to expire.  Arrived shortly after happy hour, and were seated at a high top next to the back door.  Not a great table--I immediately noticed the stains on the wall next to the table (soy sauce?).   We ordered the pork potstickers, which were tiny and overcooked.  I asked for the mustard to come on the side, so they didn't give us any.  Next came the hot lips roll--sounded good but looked like a pink mayo-globbed mess, no way to eat with chopsticks, and forget picking it up with your hands!   My date liked it,  however.   I had a little sushi (nigiri), sake and maguro--decent quality.  My date had the beef and broccoli, which was decent, and I asked for a side order of the wok vegetables.  I expected my vegetables to be a small side dish, but they came out as big as an entree.   Quantity, but not quality--they were mushy and sitting in a puddle of soy sauce (couldn't make out any other flavors).   Service was so-so, maybe because we were hidden in the corner.  I'm glad we had a gift card, or I would have been even more disappointed.  Better sushi at AJ's, honestly."

First visit.  Beautiful place, a great combination of light and dark woods, contemporary and traditional.  I waited at the bar for my date--bartenders were very friendly and there was a TV (visible but not obtrusive) with sports on, so I was happy.  No happy hour, but they have white and red wine by the glass for $5 and draft beer for $4, very reasonable.   When my date arrived, we were seated right away.  While we came to take part in Restaurant Week, we ended up ordering off the menu as we really didn't want to indulge with desert.  For apps, I had the chicken meatballs, which were very tasty, moist and had a great smoky flavor.  Very filling!  My date had the beet salad, which was wonderful.   For entrees, I had the green chile pork stew.  Now I'm a big fan of the green chile pork stew at Renegade Canteen (the bar set very high), and have to say that Beckett's was very good, but also very different from Renegade's version, so hard to compare.  The Beckett's version had corn, and a little more of the smoky chile flavor.  It came with some kick-ass corn bread, which was sweet and had great texture.  No way I could eat it all after the chicken meatballs, so I had plenty to take home.  My date had the short ribs, again an outstanding choice.   Next time I think I'll try several apps instead of entrees, so we can try even more dishes.   We'll definitely be back and we're bringing our friends next time!"

Last night was our first time--we were able to make a reservation for 7:30, great time for a Friday night.  We sat outside and it was very comfortable.  Live entertainment at no charge, awesome spanish guitar!  We started with wine and and beer and an order of the caprese appetizer to share (with mozzarella burrata, kind of a deconstructed version in bruschetta form).  The caprese was good (and I have very high standards on this) but not quite as good as the version as Humble Pie.  For dinner, I had the BLT with a side salad, very tasty--great bacon, bread and roasted tomatoes--yummy!  The BLT (and other sandwiches and burgers) come with your choice of soup, side salad, or fries.  The side salad was exceptional--not your standard fare.  My date had the Proscutto and Fig panini with french fries (seasoned with parmesan).  Our friends ordered the 5th burger and the Friday night special, the chicken pot pie, and they were very happy with their choices.  Service was good, but not obtrusive.   Overall it was a good experience, we had a lot of laughs,  and I'm sure we'll be back again."

Had heard wonderful things about Tarbell's and went for dinner on a Saturday night.  Light, contemporary vibe.  Plenty of room at the bar and superb service throughout the evening.  The bartender suggested a cucumber collins (made mine with Vodka) and it was perfect--light, refreshing and interesting.  For dinner, I started with the mozzarella salad (my weakness), which was absolutely perfect.  My date had the beet salad and was equally impressed.  For the main course, I went with the chicken sausage pasta.  I really, really liked it, but would try something else next time.  My date had the scotch beef, which is really a high end version of pot roast.  That's what I'll have next time.  We shared a bread pudding for dessert, the portion was huge so plenty to share.   Would like to have dinner at the bar sometime, maybe just share a few apps instead of big entrees.  No complaints and can't wait to return."
orMlHMLyHSldYgzfFTaeoA,ENQ_9ftK5TIUuObdjZ5Nsg,3,"Good food, friendly service

Just came back from our first visit to Eddie's.  What attracted us initially was the summer menu (Mon-Thurs select entrees for about $10).  We got there early and decided to eat at the bar.  The happy hour wine special was very good and only $5, beer $3.  Plus they have happy hour all night, every night apparently.  Half price appetizers.  We tried the flatbread and were disappointed.  It wasn't really a flatbread, rather it was soft, thick and doughy.  Nothing crispy about it and not much flavor either.  We moved on to the Niman Ranch hotdog on a pretzel roll (very tasty), and the mozzarella/tomato salad, which was also very good.  Finally, we tried the chicken lollipops, and I'd say those were good, not great.  We never did try the summer entrees as we were full by this point.  The bartender, Danny, was very friendly and attentive.   I was really impressed by the number of repeat customers at the bar, and also that Eddie and the bartenders knew the patrons by name.  Seems like a great local hangout with a neighborhood feel, which you don't always get in Scottsdale.

We'll definitely be back, overall a solid experience."
eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg,ENQ_9ftK5TIUuObdjZ5Nsg,4,"Wonderful food
I was eager to try Barrio Cafe as I recently hit Barrio Queen in Scottsdale with a friend.  Very different atmosphere, this is a tiny place with a more formal menu.  We arrived relatively early on a Friday night, around 6, and were seated immediately.   I was a little disappointed that (unlike Barrio Queen), they don't have beer on tap.  The food was wonderful, we had the guacamole with everything, which was interesting because they added pomegranate seeds.  Next time I'd ask for the guacamole to be a bit spicier, but it was wonderful.  My date had a pork torta, and it was wonderful.  I had a poblano dish (can't remember the name), which is seasonal, and filled with chicken, almonds, apricots I think, and some cheese and cream sauce.  Absolutely incredible, sweet and savory, spicy and smooth, in every bite.  My entree also came with a side of steamed veggies and some chipotle mashed potatoes, which were smoky and very flavorful.  I would definitely recommend Barrio Cafe and will be back soon!"

This was our second time at the PV mall location--we were part of a group of six and actually scored six seats at the bar while waiting.  Not bad for a Saturday night at around 8:45.  The seats were at the outside bar, and while it was crazy hot outside, the misters and fans made it more comfortable.  Contact lens wearers should beware of the fans, though.  The pizza was very good (I'm from Chicago so a tough judge on this one).  We tried the El Picasso (a southwestern pizza), which was pretty good and came crispy as ordered.  Our friends opted for a more traditional pizza, which was also very good.   I definitely recommend ordering a salad or some type of app if you're hungry when you come in--because you're waiting for a table (can be long) and then again for pizza (can be another 45 minutes).

I like the character of the Scottsdale Rd/Shea location much better, but just getting in on a Saturday night was a pretty big deal.   We'll be back"

We took my 80-something in-laws here on Friday and it was reliably wonderful.  We made a reservation on opentable.com, and didn't have to wait at all, even though we were a little early.  The staff was great at accommodating our request not to have the seniors walk too far.  We had a great table and wonderful service.  We started with a bruschetta, great tomatoes and unusual with capers, and moved on to our next courses:  meatloaf (excellent with a marsala gravy and al dente green beans--plenty for 2 people), a pizza, fish & chips and a soup/salad combo.  My mother-in-law ate more than I'd ever seen her eat before, which was great as she has a poor appetite.  We took our leftovers home and enjoyed them the next day.

Was roped into going to this place as our 80 year-old-something family members remembered the CFS fondly.  The last time they visited was before their respective heart surgeries, no joke!   The decor I could deal with, it had its own charm.  And I didn't find the service to be bad as other reviewers.  But the food . . . all of the entrees come with a starter of iceberg salad (smothered in mustard dressing or artery-clogging ranch), or mayo drenched coleslaw, and a basket of rolls.  The buttermilk biscuits were very good.  Then the entrees came.  Giant CFS smothered in more heart-attack inspiring country gravy, accompanied by mashed potatoes with the same gravy.  Tasteless, greasy gravy that had congealed before reaching the table.  The gravy likely consisted of a copious amount of cream and fat. I ordered a decent chicken kabob (only healthy item on the menu, although it did have a butter glaze), and tasteless fried potatoes.  I know, fried potatoes are not healthy, but neither are the mashed potatoes.  All the food needed seasoning--it didn't seem like there was any salt, pepper or anything on a single part of the meal.

If you have any concerns about your weight, your heart, or your health in general, skip it.  The Vig Uptown is next door and you can score some real food--plus beer on draft, which you can't get at Texaz.   I wish I could say this is an exaggerated review, but it isn't.  Reality bites."

It was Saturday night and my date and I were looking for good food and an opportunity to catch the ASU game at the bar.  We walked into the bar area and it looked very different from our previous visit.  They went from two bars to one, which in itself wasn't bad, except that the new bar backs up to the window.  So there are no TVs at the bar.  So we grabbed a tall bar table instead.  We were looking for the game and were told that they didn't have a cable package that included the ASU games.  How is this possible?  Also, went to the ladies room and there was no soap, so I had to go to another unisex bathroom to wash my hands.  A man and a woman, who may have been new owners or managers were milling around and not helping anyone, even when it was clear that people were waiting a long time to get service.  In addition, they were showing off their new party room, which looked about as appealing as a party room at Chuckie Cheese.   The party room was hidden by a big piece of plywood that had the restaurant's logo on it.  So amateurish!  Looks like the restaurant was recently taken over by owners (or managers) who simply don't realize that the customer experience is what is important.  And the manager/owners were also sitting at a table in the bar, eating dinner.  As were two of the wait staff, each taking up their own tables.  Now I have no problem with staff eating at the bar, but in most establishments it doesn't take place during busy hours of 8 p.m., and it usually happens at the bar, it is done discreetly.  Something about the whole experience struck me as extremely unprofessional.  We will never come back.  Ever.  Sorry, but I need to watch football at the bar, or in the bar area at least, with some form of service.  And without being stared at and not helped by the management!"

They take reservations, which is great, because you'd be waiting a long, long time for a table before a concert or game otherwise.  There really are no healthy options here whatsoever, unless you go for the raw bar.  Service was fine.  Food was overpriced and again, really unhealthy.  Don't park underneath the building at Cityscape--it is a nightmare to get out of there--have to essentially walk down the street, through a hotel, up an elevator and down a bunch of stairs.  Super frustrating.  Pay for parking yourself (somewhere else).  It's better than being comped for parking that ruins your evening.  Probably won't be back."

We were very excited to try the Lamp as it is just around the corner from us.  Came on a Friday night with four people and waited about 15 minutes.  No problem as there were seats for us at the front bar.  Decent wine selection, I ordered white, which was not quite chilled enough.  We asked about draft beer and was told that ""people in North Scottsdale don't like draft beer--they'd close us if we had it.""  Pretty ridiculous comment as we all know plenty of places this far north (and further north) that have draft beer.  All he had to say was no -- we were just asking.

When we got to the table, service was a little slow, the waiter brought over a little appetizer for us (bread with sausage inside), which was nice.  We each ordered our own pizza, but that's really not necessary.  Each pizza could definitely feed two people.  The pizza toppings were good, very fresh, great cheese, and not underdone. The crust of the pizza was fine on the ends but thin and soggy in the middle.  Fixing this make for a much better pizza.  But for a really great pizza, I'll still go to Oreganos.  The Lamp has the potential to be as good as Humble Pie, but hasn't quite reached it yet.  The people who worked there were very nice, though, and we'll probably give it another try."

A friend from out of town suggested Chino Bandido, as she saw it on a Food Network TV show.  I was not enthused about the idea, as I know from other reviews and personal experience that the show (Diners & Dives) highlights novel approaches to food, but not exactly food of great quality.  What makes for ratings doesn't make for a great meal in many cases.  First, it is chaotic in the restaurant, you need to know what you want when you get up to the counter, and no one explains the process.  The idea is a fusion of sorts between Chinese and Mexican, and I'd say it was a worst-of-both-worlds approach to dining.  Most of the meat was deep fried (with various sauces), served with refried beans and absolutely no vegetables.  Think tasteless chicken breast, smothered with teriyaki sauce, with a side of refried beans and a bunch of white rice.  The decor of the place didn't help anything--certainly didn't make the experience any better.  Linoleum and uncomfortable decades-old chairs.  The regulars were enthused, and if you looked around you'd see many people who were very overweight (too many servings of refried beans, apparently).  Ugh!"

I arrived with a friend just a little too early for happy hour (too bad because they have great specials on tacos), and we each ordered about 2-3 tacos.  Loved the way tacos are ordered, just like at as sushi restaurant, so they bring them to you as you want them.  Service was a little slow, although there were plenty of staff milling around and not exactly rush hour.

We hadn't been here in a while (since winter) and were so looking forward to the caprese salad, featuring mozzarella burrata.  Not your usual caprese--in a bowl you get EVOO, some balsamic, good pesto and a heaping amount of burratta, along with cherry tomatoes and  some rustic bread.   It was still very exceptional, but not as good as we remembered.  I think last time they roasted the cherry tomatoes so you could spread them on the bread (yummy!), but this time they were just left raw--so if you tried to spread them (or cut into them), they spurted everywhere (almost ruined my shirt).  They don't give enough bread with this dish, so ask for extra.  This item is not on the happy hour menu, but is definitely worth full price!  We also had the chicken wings (spicy), which were pretty good.  My only complaint on happy hour was that their signs had wine at $5, but it isn't ALL wine and I wasn't informed of that.   So be sure to ask which wines are at the HH price.   Draft beer was cold and good.  A big local crowd, seems like the staff here has great relationships with the patrons.

You need to read a paper menu to really understand what you're ordering, as the menu above the cashiers doesn't provide much detail.  I ordered an Aloha burger (grilled chicken teriyaki) and an iced tea and my bill was about $13.  My burger had choice of sides including fruit (my pick), greens, mashed sweet potato and sweet potato sticks.  I assume the sticks were oven roasted s. potato slices and that they don't deep fry them?  Might be helpful for the cashier to provide some info on that.  My meal was good, overall.  The bun was ok, the chicken was not overcooked, pineapple was perfect.  Maybe a bit too much teriyaki sauce, and the chicken cutlet went over the side of the bun by quite a bit, so made it a little awkward to eat.  Overall, I'd say it was a good meal, but a little pricey for lunch (my choice was one of the less expensive ones on the menu--some bowls are over $15).  Because of the restaurant's emphasis on nutrition, I expected to see nutritional information for menu items posted, but that was not the case. Maybe they could print some out for customers?  Otherwise you need to check calories on their website.  The portion size for my meal was perfect, but my friend ordered one of their bowls and was overwhelmed by the amount of meat/chicken in the bowl. I'd say most bowls could be shared by two people.

really quaint neighborhood joint that would be a GREAT date spot. only critique is that at dinner the house lights are probably a little too low. more light would allow the excellent food to be even more appreciated.

tuv-XKXejzGNzkRqNFCKiQ,4hWXnIzkVcqor3svhBKWcA,2,"Just kind of a crap coffee place. Been here a couple of times when others have suggested it as a meeting place.

Bland square room with a few tables/chairs, etc. Layout is poor so about 50% of the tables abuts against the line of people waiting to order and/or people waiting for their orders to be delivered. A big pet peeve of mine is having to sit at a table while people in line are brushing up against me and talking over me. Not their fault. Fault of the lazy cafe design.

Coffee/tea = good enough. Food = poor, like most small cafes with a small kitchens (Urban Beans, Hava Java, etc).

So what would make me go here? Great atmosphere and service. As some of the others have noted, the service here is sub-par, which is usually the sign of an absentee manager paying very low wages. Bad morale = bad service.

It's in a strip mall, and a crowded strip mall at that, so the parking, while available, is often a pain.

1) Hard to access, 2) Not comfortable to visit, 3) Not pleasant to deal with staff = fail. Sorry."

all of the servers were attentive and on-point. the food was amazely! we tried the red bean quesadilla which was one of the best quesadillas i've ever had. we tried the chili which was a nice amount of spicy but not too much...the front person was kind enough to let us know the chili sitch, that it may be HOT. i liked the iced tea selections. i liked the crowd...not TOO full but a healthy stream of customers.

i'd imagine if more of the Green/Nami crowd knew about this place, which is like 100 feet away, Coronado would be even more busy. Coronado has a really creative menu with a lot of interesting combos (such as a red bean quesadilla). we look fwd to going back.

//we tried  the cookies, which didn't suit our tastes...the mexican chocolate cookie was too spicy and not chocolate enough; the rosemary chocolate chip was too rosemary-heavy...we might try more of the baked goods, but it would be nicer if they covered the croissants and such, instead of leaving them out in the open. there are too many transactions around that front area to leave exposed food. that's about the only complaint. the open-air set-up would just prevent us from ordering uncovered items near the register.//

prices: not high, not low. right in the middle we thought.

plenty of parking but a dirt lot - not ideal if yer car is just-washed.

overall a really cool old house funky vegan place that delivers on service and flavor. we will return. i hope the experience is consistently this enjoyable."

we sampled pretty much all of their slices over the course of a few lunches. the baked ziti pizza is like a Carb Missile but my god it's delicious.

a very unusual, below-the-radar but SO DELICIOUS kind of place. i'll take this over any of the ""Arizona Republic/New Times"" b.s. Top Ten pizzas ANY DAY.
the best pizza in Phoenix has been found, and it's here.
also: i haven't tried the pasta dishes yet, but the owner told me all of the pasta is flown in from NY. (LaBella has an NY location.)"

the recipes and care are apparent at Middle Eastern Deli...been here multiple times and the crowd is always cool, the service is always friendly, and the FOOD is always on point. homemade pitas, best falafel i've had anywhere is always piping hot, good sides, great chicken. the small kitchen belies the bevy of flavors. even the sides of hummus that come w/ the combo plates are clearly fresh/homemade. for me, the bakery case is hit or miss - it's definitely authentic and some of the flavors, such as dates, pistachio and olive oil in a dessert are probably too potent for my (dessert) taste. i personally favor the savory side here.

i only wish there were more spots like this in phoenix. it would then truly be a great food city, like Chicago or San Francisco. we need more authentic places like this and LESS ""Sam Fox Concepts"" which are basically high-priced Cheesecake Factories.

at Middle Eastern Deli, the prices are also on the high-er side: $12/$13 for a combo plate, $2 for a small lemonade (made w/ honey and rose water - YUM).  however, it's WORTH IT when the higher prices are for good-quality ingredients and a family lineage of delicious recipes.

the inside can get a bit cramped but this is what you'd see up and down the streets of New York...if Phoenix were an older city, more spaces like this would exist and it wouldn't seem like such an anomaly.

why?

hostess and staff seemed nice. we saddled up to TG because the hip church lady exterior had been calling our name for awhile - we've passed this spot a bunch of times.

anywho today we get there at about 11:20 a.m. on a saturday, right at the start of lunchtime. a lot of kids inside - grr, too much noise...so we ask to sit outside. and this is where TG fails.

the conditions were NOT up to restaurant standards. not clean, not professional...can you really expect people to eat on a patio covered in dirt, dust and garbage?

over the years i think i've been to most of the ""Best Bagel in Phoenix"" places...mainly that small-*ss place around the Hayden/Indian Bend area, and Chompie's. none have been good and ARE YOU SERIOUS!, Einsteins...i won't even speak about that chain because that's like saying you can get a good burger at McDonald's. Einsteins. EINSTEINS!!! blech.

so anyway we hit Everything Bagels today and i gotta say: pretty amazingly GOOD. this review is for the bagels only. the only thing i'd buy at a bagel store is bagel and/or cream cheese. (they make their own cream cheese here. points) smaller than a typical NY bagel, but so what? portion size is healthier; cool. bagels are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, with a perfect ratio of toppings. at chompie's for example, the bagel exteriors are WAY too tough. at Everything, the consistency is perfect.

parking looks intimidating from the street (2 spaces in front), but they've plenty of spaces in the back, jack; so don't be fooled.

other reviews roast the side dishes here: white fish, sandwich, etc etc. don't order a salad at a pizza place; don't order a damn sandwich at a bagel place! it ain't Burger King & you can't have it your way. and in MOST big cities, popular places run out of stock before 11, Noon or 1, depending on the cuisine. in L.A., if you don't get to Amandine on the westside by 11 a.m., you don't get no cheese bread because they only make like 12 a day. yes the selection was slim (after the morning rush), but they still had a few left of most flavors and that's good enough for me. (they mentioned they do catering too, so i'd imagine if we had a big party, that would be the only way to go; not going to the counter on a Sat or Sun and expecting 3 dozen bagels to be avail.)

for the bagels and cream cheese: 5 stars. when we went, a helpful manager was staffing the counter, so our customer service experience was great. hopefully the managers here train the part-timers to be educated about the product and how to handle customer flow so the good experience is consistent.

we will be back...hopefully the experience is equally satisfying."

i've been here a few times and am impressed with the crowd management. this place, tho new, gets BIZ-ZAY, esp around lunch. the staff behind the counter, the food runners and managers are on-hand and do a really enviable job of running a busy location smoothly.

where Flower Power needs improvement is the food.
------a side of summer squash was only 25% squash
------a side of mac & cheese was cold and tiny, not warm and at least a healthy portion
------the flying avocado is OVER-seasoned with salt & pepper and Italian dressing
------the Thai wrap is OVER-sauced with the yum yet over-sugared dressing

the iced tea selection is respectable.

this may just be a Fox RC thing, or maybe just a young line cooks thing...but when you sell yourself as a ""healthy"" restaurant, and you sugar, salt and sauce your food to death, you are not healthy. you just have healthy marketing messaging.

Flower Power is a nice lunch option with a good location and pleasant service, but when i spend $15 or more/per person on lunch, i want to walk away feeling good about the quality of food i consumed...not guilty about how many calories i just ate because of the heavy hand of the line cooks. a little more modestly in your cooking would do you well, young cooks.

i think the health-conscious among us would be very happy with a healthier menu relying on fresh ingredients unhindered by salt/pepper slam dunks and sauce bazookas.

PB-Biltmore is laughably dirty with employees who clearly don't give a sh*t skulking around the sit-down area **eventually** bussing dirty tables and kind of wiping the table crumbs onto the chairs and seat cushions, which are ALWAYS full of food and sticky stuff.

I'm pretty sure the bathrooms here are the ONLY bathrooms in the Biltmore shopping center with gang etchings carved into the bathroom stalls and mirrors overlooking the sink. Management HAS TO see this on a daily basis, if they actually wash their hands...yet nothing is done to clean the defacement of property.

Paradise Bakery is the kind of place where a 20-something cashier will admonish you to ""Hold on"" if you're next in line and she or he has to step away to tend to other business, rather than the more-acceptable ""I'll be right with you"" or something to that extent.

The cookies and baked goods are Chips Ahoy quality. The main dining room is uncomfortable and cramped.

We were seated on a cute bench overlooking at the mountain and sunset that evening. The service was excellent from the moment you stepped inside the restaurant. We started our meal with steam mussels in a delicious creamy sauce. The sauce was a little salty but it was perfect to dip your bread in! (bread was fresh, crusty and warm!).

Probabaly the best duck breast (in western style) I'd tried before! Will definitely get that one again next time.
One thing to mention is they have very creative coctails list. J got a suger snap peas martini and it was amazing~ you can taste the subtle fresh sweetness of the snap peas. I had a rasberry martini and I enjoyed it as well.

We were excited about this new sushi place close to our home last week and decided to give it a try. When we walked in the restaurant around 6pm, we were the first group of customer in the restaurant. The server was nice by taking our seating us and taking orders.

We chose 3 types of sushi rolls - cucumber roll, special roll with salmon and cream cheese and an eel roll. My sis ordered a chicken-katsu. The rolls were pretty disappointing as they were very small rolls in size and not much of raw fish (sashimi) on top. It tasted like something that you could have gotten from the grocery store sushi section but a lot more expensive at Big Eye. One special roll is about $13 to $15 (only tiny 5-6 slices). My sis's chicken-katsu tasted better than sushi but the price was a bit steep as well ($12 or $13). I guess this is Scottsdale price! Oh well, we had definitely tasted better sushi with the same price.

I would not recommend this place to any friends but might give it a try again in a year or two."

I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too."

I went there about a year ago for S's birthday. A big group of us were seated at the patio outside. The atmosphere was great. I like the menu a lot. I remember the food was good but not very spectacular (when considered the price tag...). I only have it a low 4 because of its service. We had poor service that day! I hope the situation has improved since then. I will check back and report out again!"

We were there for lunch with AJ and J this Sunday. My first time there and love the decor. Frank & Lupes reminded me of the mexican restaurants we saw in Mexico City.. cute, colorful and friendly! Per AJ's recommendation, I ordered a chicken green chile soup topped with a scoope of sour cream. It was delicious! J and J both had beef burito. I personally didn't like their chips and salsa (a little bit too mild) but it was a perfect place to enjoy your lunch on Sunday!"

We had been talking about going to Little Rangoon for at least 3 months. Finally, we went there last month for J's birthday. When weentered the restaurant, it was only another table and us. We were quickly welcomed by the hostess and the server. Both of them were good in recommending the food to us.

We had a special tobu salad dish (made from soy paste, and veggies). Tobu salad was worth a try! It was spicy and yummy. We ordered a 3 out of 4 on its spicyness scale. We thought we could handle it! But NO! It was too spicy for us even though we are big spicy food fans. ;)

We also tried their Burmese style lamb curry and a Malaysian fried noodle. The lamb curry was good with roti pharata and steam rice! I definitely will go back for both tobu and lamb curry dish. I have a higher standard for Malaysian food since I am a Malaysian. I have to say that I wasn't very impressed by its Malaysian fried noodle. Maybe we should just stick to the local Burmese food next time. Price-wise... I think it is a bit above the average restaurant price but with its quality in food and service, we will definitely check back!"

This restaurant is definitely one of our fav in town! We are lucky to find it about a year ago. Giuseppe is a family-owned italian restaurant on N. Scottsdale Rd with super friendly services. My favorate dishes there are on their 'chef recommended' menu. The price is higher than the rest of the entrees on the menu but not super expensive. One 'chef-recommended' entree is about $15.

However, to give them credit, they do have a good beer lineup and their cooked japanese style food is very good.  Service has always been excellent."

Nice assortment of specials every night, and interesting items show up on the board all the time, he has a friend in the shipping business.  We've had some items here I've never had at a sushi restaurant, straight from Japan, very special indeed, rare shellfish and other delicacies.  Not a fancy place but nice inside, great prices, good sake selection, good service and wonderful food."
tcT3oHh_dwi_FYhozw3Ibw,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"I like this place a lot, it is cute and cool, but the prices for wine are silly for S. American brands.  Your best bet here is to buy a bottle of something in the $27-$35 range rather than glass at a time for $12-$14.  Then if you don't finish it (you are going to finish it), take it with you.

We do love the back area, its very neat, one of the best patios in Phoenix and they're dog friendly.  Come in the morning for Coffee and Tammie Coe (YUM!) pastries.  They also serve MJ breads for their evening tapa style options.

For food, get an order of Bruschetta, its very nice and they have some very good food for the price.  This is where they shine - not with the wine, which is pretty good, just overpriced.  Their cheese platters are also quite good, well worth it.

Each month they have a wine tasting with Kim Hartleroad, make sure you come in for that.  For $25 you get some nice snacks, 3 to 4 wines to taste and some great lessons from a local wine guru.

Its very nice to have a place for evening tapas and wine as well as great options in the morning with Illy Coffee and Tammie Coe pastries.  They have a great place here, make sure you stop in, day or night!"
TZl7YBuzo5awZP8QJDLg_w,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,1,"After a meal at Moira Sushi, we decided on a whim to stop in at Jordon's for a fried ice cream dessert.  We walked in the door and the place smelled of old carpet and b.o.  Not very appetizing, but I'm willing to give any place a chance.

We ordered the dessert, it arrived promptly...and was clearly not freshly made.  A very icky mushy crust with some cinammon and a dab of whipped cream, after a few bites we both looked at each other and said ""yuck!"".  Worst fried ice cream we've ever had!

After seeing some of the food passing by, it's probably on par with any other chain mexican, similar to a macayos or carlos o'briens.  Crispy tacos, flaccid yellow cheese, tomato and lettuce on everything.  Surely a step up from Taco Bell, but what's the point of that?

WIth so many authentic cheap (and good) Mexican food places nearby with great corn tortillas and cotija cheese, I'll call this one a total pass....and I understand why I've never stepped foot in the door in 10 years that I've lived within 3 miles of the place."
fjapWp89YVCeKvW51KUDQw,URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,4,"We stopped in this evening for a grab-n-go meal (bacon and eggplant lasagna, not too bad, I had a taste).  We walked out with $70 worth of grocery items and a Jacuzzi Primitivo wine (don't scoff at the Jacuzzi name, its an old name and a terrific vineyard - we originally tried their wine from igourmet.com's wine club, and it was fantastic!).

My wife made a comment that this place is probably pronounced Luchi's...I'm not sure, but it may be...quite a lot of italian grocery items and also a good selection of Kosher items.  I'd rate the grocery as similar to Trader Joe's but higher end and much smaller.  It's not cheap, but it's what you'd expect in value for the price.

I really like the coffee bar with the roll up garage door and the old fashioned styling.  This place is a wonderful new addition to the neigborhood, I'd love to go back soon.  Too bad they don't serve wine or have wine tastings....but you can't do it all!

I would never go to Starbuck's across the street with this place open.  They serve nice baked goods from Simply Bread (wish they had Tammie Coe and MJ Bread, but you can't have it all), and some delicious cheesecake they buy from some famous place in Chicago.  Free wi-fi!"

We are glad we did, this place is just what we were looking for!  We left happy after some nice rolls and two kinds of Pho, both of which were delicious.   We were the only non Vietnamese in the place but as we've always found at Vietnamese restaurants, everyone was friendly and service was decent.

The menu is pretty extensive and there are some pictures of sandwiches on the wall, which look delicious.  I'll have to try them someday when I don't have a Pho craving."

I'm not sure what she meant, but it definitely wasn't the burgers at Stax.   Stax's 3oz slider-style burgers are a 2-bite size slice of burger heaven.   Being able to choose from Salmon, Beef, Turkey, Buffalo, Lamb and other meats is amazing.  You can put anything you want and the burgers are small enough that you can try a couple of different combinations.

For the record, I figured out why the white man killed all of the buffaloes as he swept across the plaints:  It's goddamned tasty!  Seriously, if I'd known buffalo was this good I would've rented dances with wolves like 2 weeks ago.

The service rocked and the bar is nicely stocked.   Well done.....chic Scottsdale crowd but if you can stand the hokey wanna be rich and cool vibe of the crowd you'll be rewarded with a great meal."

It's a burger joint with all the class and style of a downtown jazz club located in a strip mall across the street from a gelato shop.  It's a marriage of convenience to an ugly girl who really knows how to work it.

The best things about Delux are its burgers and fries.  The fries, sweet potato and regular, are crisp, salty and delicious.  They are served in miniature shopping carts with the D for Delux emblazoned on the front.  Our server adorably quipped ""Fries A La Cart.""  Heh...heh....ehhhhh.....they still tasted good.

The burgers are properly cooked to order and the meat is flavorful and satisfying.   I've been twice now and have yet to be disappointed.   My only beef (pun intended) with Delux is the lack of 1000 island dressing for my burger (I'm white trash like that).   However, the aioli which is spicy but still smooth makes up for the lack of 1000 as a substitute condiment.

The beer list is extensive and the menus are adorable.  The outside patio is misted and looks out onto a nice view...well, for a road-side strip mall at least.  If you go during peak hours, expect a wait.   It's reasonably priced but still a $15/head trip."
AfN3Z1U6QPEgAb5F2CQm8w,mGUoZLyDhn_XD2Bn9PdxAg,2,"I'm giving CM's two stars because despite the fact that the beer was decent and the food mostly tasty, I was so immensely turned off when I had to listen to the ""we really don't do separate checks"" speech from our server.   We were a party of 8 engaging in light drinking and mostly appetizers.   This was not culinary calculus.

I've served.  I've served parties ranging in size from 1-63.   Never, ever has it been a problem giving people separate checks, even 63 of them.   You teach your party to be patient but give them what they want.  ""We aren't really supposed to do separate checks"" is your way or signifying to me that you're lazy or stupid, with neither being a quality I want from a server.

Fried food, burgers, wraps and seafood are a dime a dozen.  What makes a restaurant standout is how welcoming it is, pardon the cheesey reference, but how much like Cheers it is.   The first step in the journey to earning loyal customers if service and whining about separate checks is no step forward--it's a backflip."

The real reason I'm giving them 3 stars though is their imposter Fire and Ice Restaurant.  We went to a Fire and Ice in Tahoe and its improvisational dining (read: American Mongolian BBQ) rocked our world.   The folks at Jillians (read: Dave & Busters) call it the Market Grill but it's exactly like a Fire and Ice.

Luke's can't hold a candle to Delux or the Sonora Brewery, but they are definitely cheaper, likely closer and they've a down-home feel.

The customer service was fantastic and incredibly friendly.  I definitely felt very welcome and the atmosphere was warm, even if they muttered about my Red Sox stomping the White Sox on the t.v. and changed it because they couldn't bear to watch.

I also enjoyed the Oregon-made Rogue Brown Ale.   I've never had it on draft, but it rules.  Papago is very reasonably priced and has some tasty, high-carb appetizers.  I enjoyed the wings, pretzels and beer bites.   They were all good but not amazing.

Not so at ""That's a Wrap.""  My wife describes this adorable wrap shop as being one which makes both her inner slut and inner fat girl happy.  It allowed her to eat good food until she was full without feeling guilty about ruining her diet.   She enjoyed the my sherry amore.  I enjoyed the Rocky VII, basically a cheesesteak wrap.  Both were excellent.  The pasta salad was pedestrian but decent and the fresh fruit salad was spectacularly fresh.

Very reasonably priced and an aesthetically pleasing interior.   Parking is a bitch though a serious problem if you go during a busy time like the lunch hour.  Have someone who can parralel park do the driving."
RsREl3LkFGiwbt3kGIX4Eg,mGUoZLyDhn_XD2Bn9PdxAg,4,"Somewhere, beneath layers of flacid, white skin, I am a black man.   Though I cannot readily identify with years of oppression, white women crossing the street when I pass for no good reason and the spectre of slavery, I think that my love of motown, broad-hipped women and soul food makes me, at the least, an honorary brother.

Strangely, and perhaps because of hunger, the best BBQ pork sandwich I ever had was dolled out to me as I hurriedly boarded a plane in Nasville, TN.   I've dined all across America and even in Memphis itself and I've tasted some fine BBQ and contrary to other reviewers here, I thought HB BBQ was a-ok.

I was feeling depressed last night, the unfortunate consequence of some protracted litigation I'm involved in and I got a hankering for slow-cooked meat slathered in tangy bbq sauce and my craving guided the wheel as I drove to HB's.

It still looks like an IHOP.  They've changed the booths and moved some things around, but the decor has a definite ""International House of Barbeque"" feel to it.   I must also admit that I was more than a little dismayed when 3 hispanic guys made my bbq pork sandwich.  What in all the red tamales do hispanic folks know about BBQ?  Call me picky, but when I get something called Honey Bear BBQ with a song of the south lookin bear on the sign, I expect a large black man or woman with a disarming smile to sling my pork and slaw together on a paper plate--the way god intended.   Perhaps I'm missing out on all the great latin BBQ, but I've long believed that after all the suffering God forced upon my brothers, he tried to make penance by imbuing them with rhythm, soul and bbq knowledge.

Nonetheless, the sandwich was tasty.  I would have liked a spicy sauce option, but I'll take what I can get.  It's not deep south bbq and it's probably not even like Mom's, even if your mom was irish and grew up in poughkipsie, but it's at least pretty tasty and reasonably priced.  It's Phoenixand 50 degrees in the dead of winter.  We take what we can get."

Of course, had I known, I would have driven a stake through my eye rather than dine here.   This is because, as the previous reviewer noted, dining at the good egg is like playing chess with yourself:  The sort of thing you do only in times of absolute desperation.

Given that, my expectations withered to McDonalds levels once I sat down and figured out about its nefarious affiliation.   However, I was mostly pleasantly surprised, a feat which isn't hard since the bar was set somewhere below sea level.   I had a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  The cheese was a tasty brie and the bread a thick and fluffy sourdough.   The eggs were bland and shitty (read: from a can) but the bacon and cheese made up for it.

At 7.50 for the sandwich, it's far from a bargain but it wasn't a complete waste of money.  The service sucked as my server struggled to refill my soda just once.   When she finally did (well after dropping our check) she did at least put it in a to-go cup.  I like the message implicit there--""get the fuck out,"" don't you?

For this reason it is perhaps ironic that the one soft spot in my otherwise much-maligned heart is for hot dogs and burgers cooked over an open flame.

It's no surprise then that I'll be going back to Ted's.  Like a phillistine, I had a chesseburger but it was tasty.  The onion rings are also good, much more to my taste than traditional O-rings.

eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg,mGUoZLyDhn_XD2Bn9PdxAg,5,"The Barrio Cafe is a fucking unreal dining experience; But at first glance, you'd never know it.   Barrio is a tastefully decorated, two-room restaurant located in a predominately hispanic area in central Phoenix just off of Thomas and 16th St.    Normally I would never recommend a restaurant located next to a 99-cent store, but Barrio Cafe is a rare and treasured exception.

My wife and I went with friends who were regulars and gracious enough to pick up the hefty tab.   Our friends described the cuisine as French-Mexican fusion cuisine, a term I happily blended into the cheerily trite ""Frexican.""   In realty, I'm not sure that I detected the French elements.  Sufficed to say, the food does adopt a central Mexican, colonial flair.   If I were liken the type of cuisine to any previous experience, it is most like that of the Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson though with a less traditional feel.

Barrio has an extensive and seemingly well-formed wine list which I did not personally avail myself of.  I enjoyed a smooth and tasty import beer called Sol.   As a side note, I strongly recommend Sol to anyone who likes Tecate but feels bad about drinking Mexican swill.   Sol is to Tecate as Allison Krauss is to Dolly Parton--All the same fun without the white trash guilty feeling when you're done.

We enjoyed a delightful Guacamole and chips appetizer.  Though still chock-full of advocados and the accompanying calories, Barrio's guac-fare also boasts nuts and apples and some other unexpected ingredients which lend the guac a sweet and light flavor that makes you feel like you're eating healthy whilst clogging your arteries, a ruse I always appreciate.

For dinner I enjoyed their filet mingon which was served with a goat cheese and crab meat topping on a bed of well-prepared red peppers and other ingredients I just cannot recall.  In addition to preparing the meat as ordered (MR), Barrios beef was flavorful and tender as one would expect from the Filet.   I devoured this.   I was hungry and it was so incredibly tasty I didn't do a good job of savoring, I just inhaled it.

We enjoyed a churro with whipped cream for dessert.   A churro.   Yes, a churro.   What can I say except: Churro?  Fuck Yeah!

Seriously...go.   But, bring your credit card because you'll average $30/head without even drinking.   Budget on 50-60/head if you're drinking."

Of course, this is not to imply that Pie-Zanos is staffed by mouth-breathing ""pizza artists"" or stocked with sub-par ingredients and generally filthy.  On the contrary, this ""Subway of Pizza"" is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza.

Pie-Zanos allows you to pick from wheat or white dough and from up to 8 different sauces.  From there you can add herbs and crust flavoring and then you can pick from 6-8 different cheeses.  Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings you'll find anywhere.   The fare is basically affordable as long as you don't go apeshit on toppings (55 cents each after the first).   As a special bonus they have Pepsi products.

I have also enjoyed the breadshits which are fresh and delightful and pair nicely with the traditional red marinara as well as the tomato-pesto.

My only complaints with Pie-Zanos and what keeps it from achieving 5 stars is how busy it gets at lunch, limited indoor seating and the fact that they allow children's birthday parties which, when mixed with ubiquitous bad parenting, quickly turns a hip and snazzy pizza joint into a Chuck-E-Cheese's."

The burger is a perfect measuring stick for every-day dining establishments; It is sold almost everywhere and does not rely on special ingredients and is always a good barometer of a kitchen's capacity for meeting your temperature needs.

That said, I have enjoyed the American Kobe burger here several times and it is consistently above-average and frequently quite excellent.   My wife has enjoyed the wrap and several other sandwiches and remains pleased.   We also enjoy the spinach and artichoke appetizer.   The wings are average at best but the kettle chips with chipotle ketchup rules.    Oh, and they have 1000 island.

RN0PTeMSF_eaeXN6VV7RwA,mGUoZLyDhn_XD2Bn9PdxAg,4,"I was a sushi virgin and based on the reviews this was probably the wrong place to pop my cherry.  But I did and it was simply alright.  I had the california rolls which were edible and I ate the entire thing.  I smothered them in soy sauce and focused on the rice.   The only problem was it was really dark and I thought the dollop of wasabi was a stray slice of avocado so my first bite was an entire mouthful of wasabi which made me nearly double over in mouth-searing agony.  I flailed frantically until I found my beer which I promptly inhaled as a means of quenching the tartar-esque inferno raging in my mouth.

After I quenched it, I managed to choke down the rest of the rice, avocado and partially uncooked fish.  The sum of my experience is the unshakable notion that people don't really like sushi.  It's not as good as real fish and it's dangerous and more than a little creepy.  I think this is one of those foods you pretend to like in order to seem cool.  But, hey, I'm just a burger guy.

Admittedly, the sandwiches and wraps they offer really aren't my cup of tea, but the southwestern club I had was chock-full of quality ingredients and service was prompt and cheerful.   I also enjoyed the cream of broccoli soup in a breadbowl.

Staff was friendly and service was good no complaints really to speak of it's just not what I am searching for.
b5epWgPoVcXoMJdCCzFMUw,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,"First Visit, Had the Pulled Pork sandwich and Lobster Bisque soup combo,  the meal also comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry.  The food was quite good especially the pork sandwich.  May try a Different soup next visit.  It was good but not great and with so many to try I am sure i can find a favorite in the soups as well.

I normally eat quite a bit when I go out and this was more than I needed at only 7.99 so the prices are quite nice as well."
VoTi4yVhTVyFdmxUpoyUsg,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,5,Food was very fresh very good and staff very friendly.  my only down would be portion size but i had a rather large appetite so for most I am sure its about just right so I wont take a star for my overly large appetite.  Found this on Yelp and what a nice little gem of a find.
DgZ-pZUo3drzpiCDlDr9IQ,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,5,"Loved this place,  did a search for a place nearby to eat something different.. seen this place had nice reviews and close and we my wife and I liked a Vietnamese place near our old home so thought it would be good to check out.  The people were really friendly and helpful, Wife had asked how to pronounce a few things in there language and she seems excited to share with us and then would tell us how to say each thing they brought to the table it was fun she would make sure we pronounced it all correctly before moving on to each new word.     The food was wonderful I had a 41, wife was like a 38 or something and son got a 14.  she then taught us the proper way to prepare to our taste each thing we ordered and how to eat them.  We shared around the table what we each got and all of it was great.  Oh don't forget to get the coffee if your a coffee lover its almost like having a nice little dessert drink with your meal..

Service even though very busy was quick and very friendly we had at least four people stop to make sure we had everything we wanted. prices were good but the food was outstanding.. we will be back for sure to sample more items soon."
9tKSEjLCJowSkxze0NiFig,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,5,One of my favorite places to eat in this area of town. food is great people are nice.  I seem to like the Spartan club most and like going with someone so I have room for a few Greek fries. :)
Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,"Places seem to come and go at this location I missed the last one.  came like the day after it shut its doors so I wasn't going to be left out this time.  Glad I went,  Had the Stand Cheeseburger, fries and a Banana Shake it was all good.(Love the HUGE straws) looking forward to making it back to try some of those Tacos!!

Lets see if we can keep this place going and break that bad location mojo."
2DUdvdQE8FOxCHHp59HHzw,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,5,This place is quickly becoming a favorite.  Tried it with a co-worker on a Wednesday then took the wife back for breakfast on the next Sunday.  both breakfast and lunch were outstanding.  I have had a club sandwitch before but something about the flavors in Hers that just put it way better than any other I have had.  can't wait to try more things.
yHBhLawYmIthUPLbUXK5kw,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,Good Burros yes burros I like the tacos ordered with flour tortillas they roll it all up in a Burro and Yumm I have sampled most of the burros depending on mood but all are very good.
E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,First time there after finding them with yelp.  Tried the street tacos they were good not the best I have had but still very good and the price is right.  The cute young lady taking orders was very personable and helpful and lead us to what we should try first.
OvG9pbudLhmLkjrttGvhAQ,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,For a chain style Sub place its quite good.  food seems fresh has good flavors and service is very friendly and prompt.  Seems to be a lot of competition in the sub sandwich business but they hold there own quite well with other chains.
cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,2,"Been there twice both times Disappointed.  First visit I tired a sandwich Besides being well overpriced for what you get to begin with a friend with me asked for a little Balsamic vinegar however that would be an up charge.  Sodas come in bottles so if you drink more and one it of course cost you more.   The food was not bad but I would not describe it as great either the bead was hard to bite through tough and grilled hard on the outside.  Second time I was sort of dragged back in we a group was headed to another place when everyone besides me was all wanting to go try it.  So I go in with intentions of spending a bit more for a pasta dish remembering how I left hungry with a sandwich last time.  BAD IDEA I bought the Spaghetti very lack luster simple pasta and tomato sauce the noodles were cooked quite well but the sauce reminded me of that hunts canned sauce I use to by when I was on a tight budget fresh out of college.  Garlic bread.. oh wait I forgot no bread everything is up charged I didn't go past the 16 bucks I was already spending for the so so tiny portion of pasta I was already given and a soda. I figured I would be better off finding the vending machine in the office later for filler.

Bottom line for me Decent tasting food very small portions High prices will not return even if the group all decides that's where they are going again.  Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?"
sKy8HkP6X-8dCKq_SzeIpw,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,Good place.. the decor is nice old building and they accent its charm in the decor. food was delish kids had pizza wife and I had sand witches. not just another pizza joint is what I enjoyed about it.
bsauQzwixetBDjA7SqUlVA,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,Reviews are dead on good food good service in a little bit of a strange out of the way location.
zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,Couple guys I work with found this place on Yelp so we went to check it out.  We may have come on a bad day being a Friday and they close from 12:30 to 1:30 to pray but we did make it in early enough.  At first was concerned because they were missing some spices so a few of the items we were thinking about were off the menu.  But we asked what type of chicken was his favorite and he said the Boti Chicken so we gave that a try.  we ended up getting the rice served along with the dish and ordered the Nan? (bread) as a side everything was really good the Boti has a little bite to it but not too much very good but do want to sample a few more dishes before deciding on a favorite.  I will keep you informed on my explorations in the future because we all decided this place needs to be on our regular lunch rotation.
iJBnqweAPDTCfyMcRrG90w,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,4,Been here a couple times now both times the burgers were great.  You get tired of the typical fast food burgers.. reminds me a little of lennys downtown just smaller.  the pies there look fantasic but have yet to try them.
ept9mIlqGIsemr6w0RczaA,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,3,Been here a number of times.  I am not a huge fan of the food but it is good.  I seem to always be torn between ordering a side if I do its way to much to eat however if I don't I feel still a slightly hungry after.  The food is different lots of dishes you can order other places but they seem to have there own special twist on things.  I know if I keep sampling the menu items I will find something I really like...  end up there most time with guys from the office who really like the eye candy that seems to almost always be in the place.
UywPvignjHoj8ipT7l2OFw,28crxH7TMqgeHZltghUoUg,5,Been here three times now never a disappointment.  Everything I have tried has been fantastic. Very young friendly service even the people seem to be more friendly that go there.  a little small it does have some outdoor seating if the temps arent to hot.

The food, that sauce they call BBQ sauce( they should rename it cuz its way better than others I've had), and especially the good prices. Only reason im not givin it 5 stars is the cash register lady had a huuuuge attitude when we were ordering our meats. She was acting as if I was troubling her by asking for food. I've been to other ones in texas where they don't mind talking to you. Yes I ordered a lot of food bc we had a huge appetite but I didnt appreciate her derogatory tone when she said ""is that enough food for you now?"" and no, she wasnt being sarcastic. Not even a smile or smirk after. I mean wow, do you want me to come behind the cash register and get my own meat if it's too troubling for you to turn around and get the meat I ordered?

W8xG9Bzk3TPPkBR5jx1pgg,OPiV-yNPoLf57J1OWUdylA,1,"I'm sad to report that ""The Casablanca Lounge"" that was a welcome oasis in a sea of cocktail mediocrity has morphed into just another downtown Scottsdale bar.

What attracted me instantly to The Casablanca Lounge were skilled and thoughtful bartenders that would produce wonderful and interesting craft cocktails with quality ingredients and were absolutely focused on quality, artisanal recipes and most of all, the experience of mixology from a time long forgotten.

I was ""this"" close to recommending it for my companies in flight magazine as one of the last great American bar experiences, but I'm sort of relieved that I never got around to submitting my recommendation.

It starts like this.

My wife and I thought we'd drop by for a cocktail this last saturday night for a delicious and interesting craft cocktail.

We approach the door and there's a podium set up and a lady we hadn't seen before who asked us, ""May I help you?""

""We're just here for some cocktails.""

A pause.

""Well, it's $10 for men, $5 for women.""

That's odd, well, it was already past midnight so I didn't think it was worth paying a cover, which we hadn't been asked to pay before so I turned around.

""$5!  $5 each! $5 for both!""

Odd.  But then she let us in free.

We walked into the bar and it... was... disgusting.  Dirty floors, glasses across the bar, unattended and it looked like a disaster area.  We find a couple of clean seats at the bar and wait.... and wait.. and wait.  I disappear to the restroom and my wife is going to order a couple of drinks.  Then I realized that they must have had a management change because I've seen better kept restrooms in a Greyhound bus station.  During previous visits, this would have never happened.

I return to the bar and our two cocktails have arrived.

Instead of orange and lemon zest in our cocktails, we've literally got orange and lemon peels (thick pith and all) in our drinks, an incorrect liquor was used (we ordered Basil Haydens and we were charged Basil Haydens prices but for something with much lower quality) and the drink was absolutely incorrect.

After another 15 minutes, and watching some strange man walk in and out of the bar area that seemed to be a manager (tall guy, coat, scarf) but didn't seemed concerned with the operation of the bar, but seemed more interested in drunken female patrons and collecting numbers), we finally found a bartender to talk to about our cocktails.

He agreed that they weren't made properly and that there are a lot of new people and training was fairly lacking.

Sad.  We're already 45 minutes in, at this point, and I haven't had more than a couple of sips of my re-made beverage when one of the nastiest things on earth happens.

I feel something sticky on my pant leg and there's a large glob of gum was stuck on the leg of my chair and was now smashed into my pants.  I grabbed a napkin and did my best to remove it, but I'm afraid even as of Sunday, 22 hours later, my pants are permanently ruined.

I'm both pissed and sad.

I'm pissed about my experience and paying $30 for two drinks that I could have gotten poorly made ANYWHERE.

And I'm sad because one of the reliable greats, and oasis of cocktail wonderful in downtown Scottsdale has died under what seems to be horrific management, unskilled bartenders and a lack of basic bar cleanliness.  My favorite pants are absolutely ruined.

How this place went from a place that I would recommend to all of my friends and colleagues to an expensive, pretentious version of ""Patti's"" should be a federal crime.

Disgusting.  Unclean.  Pretentious.  Save this place."
EzNdXFIaUqU1SC75dJJKRw,OPiV-yNPoLf57J1OWUdylA,2,"I had pretty high expectations.

Beautiful restaurant.

However...

Stopped in for happy hour, the beer seemed very warm and somewhat flat.  Probably having some problems with refrigeration, but we're also in Arizona so I gave them a pass on this.

We ordered the happy hour mussels and chicken wings.  Disastrous.

A good number of the mussels had cracked shells so  We didn't know if they were pried open or just roughly handled.  The texture of the mussels were chewy and the flavor was extraordinarily ""fishy"" and somewhat funky.  Maybe they were woefully overcooked or maybe I should have known better by ordering mussels when it's 95F, it's Scottsdale and it's a sunday.  Did not finish the dish because it wasn't worth the risk.

The wings had a good texture, but had all of the spice and flavor of a BF Goodrich tire.  The only time in history I've actually considered adding salt to Buffalo wings just to get a little zip.  Texture good, flavor terrible and well, overcooked.

Mediocre, expensive experience and I'm glad we didn't order entrees because if the appetizers were this marginal, I'm sure the steak would be as well.

Thanks, but no thanks."
hoiMOXY9hF3KKxVpF5dRsA,OPiV-yNPoLf57J1OWUdylA,2,"CONS:
1.  Food was passable.
2.  Mediocre selection of anything other than domestic macrobrew.
3.  Service needs SERIOUS help.   The three times i went, the waitresses and front door staff had the charisma of a dejected Hot Topic cashier.  Hey, I'm here to drink beer and run up my cholesterol, let's be happy, ok?


PROS:
1.  When there are better draft beer choices, they certainly have the size advantage.
2.  The seem to handle large crowds fairly ok.
3.  Lots of promise when they tighten up their menu and improve the beer selection."
H1Mp8I2YuyBe8lFHnRk3iA,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,2,"We went for lunch, after checking out their website.

Their website and the window right by the front door says they offer sirloin and lamb burgers for $8-10, and a meat sampler for $8.

Our waitress came and she explained we could either do the salad bar for $10 or the meat ""buffet"" and salad bar for $20, with no mention of the burgers or meat sampler. When I asked about the burgers, she said they no longer offer that. When I asked about the meat sampler she (sorta begrudgingly) agreed that still was offered.

We got the meat ""buffet"", and it was decent enough. My main issue is if your lunch menu has been drastically cut down, take it off your website and off your front-window. It borders on bait-and-switch when you only tell your customers about the $20 option, never mention the $8 sampler option, and remove $8 burgers without telling anyone."

They've done a great job creating a swank atmosphere, and I like knowing that I can always go and grab a drink at the back bar while I wait for my table.

All of the french toast options are amazing (especially the Almond crusted kind) and the omelettes are solid (although the chorizo is on the mild side if you're opting for that.)

I love this place and hope it has a long and successful future."
BxKxFHXG4B2h1MXK8ebHZQ,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,2,"We sat on the patio and it's really an attractive looking spot. Romantic and cute. The appetizer was delicious, our cocktails were strong and tasty, and my entree (the flank steak) was pretty solid. I wouldn't say amazing. I probably wouldn't order it again. But, for that moment in time, it did what it needed to do.

My only complaint? It's a weird one. I kept getting hit by water. I was very confused for the first ten minutes. I kept telling my girlfriend that it was raining and she thought I was crazy. At one one point a giant drop hit my right hand, and she saw it happen (thank god.) The waiter, walking by me, must have overheard me say something about it and he causally mentioned, as he continued to briskly walk by our table, ""there's a pool on the roof.""

The couple next to us suddenly piped up, and told us that they too had been getting sprinkled with pool water all night.

When the pool water hit my dinner plate, I started to wonder, ""why aren't they telling people about this?"" I mean look, it's one thing to have a pool above your customers that's drizzling on them. It's another to ask ""inside or outside"" without casually mentioning, ""oh, the front row is in the Shamu splash zone."" Just tell people, Virtù! That way we can make an informed decision."

mUVAMNN7BCQ9HGA9w_7C1g,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,4,"There is an ""executive chef"" of Ingo's who comes by once in a while (he's got a unique hairstyle, so that's how you'll notice him.) Our main complaint with him is although he doesn't ever actually make the food, once it's set out for the waitresses to grab and serve it, he'll randomly come by and just touch the food for no reason. It's very bizarre. He basically just walks by and ""taps"" your burger buns like he's hitting bongo drums. That might be just a weird little tic that one could overlook if his hands were clean. Unfortunately my party and I once watched him take out the trash, then, without washing his hands, walk right over and start doing his ""burger bun tapping."" If you don't have to touch the food, don't touch the food. And if you're going to touch the food for no reason, please wash your hands before you do it.

That being said, I personally love the Farmer's Daughter burger. That with a individually brewed ice tea really is great on a hot day. It's a fun little spot and if you don't mind sitting at the counter with you friends, it can be great for a quick lunch.

I'm excited for the fall when sitting outside on the patio won't be horrible and then the seating will effectively more than double. I come here probably one a week for a bite, and hope you'll check it out."

My heart wanted the one omelette option on the menu to be a chorizo omelette instead of a potato omelette. When I asked for the change, the portly hipster behind the counter gave me that look. The one that says, ""dude, we're so popular right now we don't have to give you anything.""

He told me they aren't able to change a thing. I ordered the waffle, bacon, and potoatoes, with a side of scrambled eggs. The waffle wasn't my favorite kind (I prefer one that's crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside). This waffle was just soft, like a pancake. The eggs were typical. Not fluffy air goodness, like I always hope eggs will be. Bacon was limp and fatty.

Sometimes I feel like a breakfast spot like this gets its high ratings mostly because it tries very hard to be unique and trendy, less than because the food is actually delicious. But I'll be honest: I've never craved a pork chop in my breakfast, and this place isn't changing my mind on that front.

If you're wanting pancakes and the like (basically dessert) then you're going to love their options here. But c'mon, you could go to a million hip places in the valley that offer a carb-rich, sugar filled pancake and be thrilled. The real posers of breakfast are revealed in how they do the non-carb options. Sorry Vovomeena. For me, you're nothing more than a hipster poser. Great coffee though."
sm0stXMEmnR4fjAAVbCYtw,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,4,"They use antibiotic and hormone free meat, and give you so many topping choices that you can really create a customized experience. They were also quite friendly and the place had a fun vibe. I'll be back."
ZMp18tQQTjloj0pKSdENBw,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,2,"The reason for my low stars is to draw attention to the fact that this Bosa location has their large iced coffee priced at $3.98 cents. That's the same price Starbucks charges for a extra large cold brew coffee, which brews for 24 hours.

Other Bosa locations charge $2.49 to $2.98 for their large iced coffee, which is reasonable. But when you're paying $4 for a iced coffee, you should be at Carrel Coffee, or Hazelrock, or even Starbucks. Not a donut shop where the iced coffee is churned out like a factory. I like Bosa, but in terms of coffee, it's bottom of the barrel in quality. They should be the cheapest ice coffee in town, not the most expensive."
gMN6VKmu4E1EmlMYzz9A3w,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,1,"The staff at the counter was nice and the food was mediocre. The main thing that killed the entire experience was that we arrived at 8pm (their hours are 6am to 9pm) and by 8:20, when we went for a refill, they had shut the entire soda machine down and were stacking chairs. When we wanted a refill they had to actually put they nozzles back on the soda machine to allow us to get a refill.

I think you need to at least stay open the hours posted on your door, and not rush the people who just paid to eat at your restaurant out the door. We were the only people eating when we went, and although the server was friendly, you need to stay open the hours you say you will. No one wants to eat while the place is being shut down. If you want to close early, you need to say so."
fKm6mfATDJRDDQH0PtZeeQ,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,4,"I love Hillside for breakfast and come whenever I can.

The meat they use is of a very high quality, and makes everything amazing. The Levain bread is really fantastic. Basically everything food related is great.

The problem, as many have noted, is in Hillside's service. I've had a number of servers who have been very good, so it's not a systemic issue.

But, that being said, there are a number of servers who are about as bad as it gets. They won't come to take your order until you've been there almost 15 minutes. They drop the food off and you'll never see them again unless you flag them down and almost yell to them. These folks aren't unfriendly, but they're also not exactly caring about your experience.

So, you're left with the feelings that I have: hope that Yelp gets the management weeds out the poor servers, so this place can be the 5 stars it should be."
QbtJvTQfTFbPqBhjkI59BA,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,4,"Great wings and I love how late they're open all week long. Sometimes after 10 the music can be ear-bleedingly too loud, but that's not too often. A good pic for late night food and a place to hang out on weekday nights."
e5maG90XWT2pYqkfbxIdIQ,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,1,"My office co-workers and I have been going to Wanda's every single Wednesday morning since 2008. All 6 of us stopped last week, after 5 years, because the service has gotten ridiculously bad.

Wanda's goes through employees very quickly, because, from what we've been told by a number of waitresses, the owner is a complete jerk. The newest round of employees, probably disgruntled, do not even try.

You'll never get a refill on your coffee, iced tea, or soda. What makes this ridiculous is the place is so small and never busy. The wait staff mostly sits in the kitchen, and many times recently I've had to go back there to find them to get a refill.

Wish we could still go there, but instead we've switched to U.S. Egg down the street."
rcSFEzRoIcDZhf8Frrm71A,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,1,"I recently went to lunch at Espos, and engaged in an epic battle for a churro.

As I approached the counter to get my chorizo burrito and churro, the churro was missing and a plate of sopapillas was there instead. Before I could say anything, the woman behind the counter said bluntly, ""We're out of churros, so I gave you sopapillas.""

I thought about it for a second, and realized only a churro was really worth the extra flab my friends would see at the pool that weekend, and told her, politely, I'd really just prefer to not have sopapillas.

""You just want your dollar back?"" she barked, as if I had asked her to drive to the U.S. treasury to collect one. I said yeah, I just love churros, and don't think I need anything else.

She huffed to the register, grabbed a dollar, and handed it to me.

Now look, one doesn't want to be petty, but really, the churro (after tax) costs $1.26. As I looked at her face that was saying, ""Why couldn't you just eat your damn sopapillas like I told you to?"" it occurred to me I shouldn't have to pay Espos twenty-six cents for a churro I never got.

""I think it was a $1.15 on the menu,"" I said.

Oh man, now she was pissed. Saying nothing, she hit a few buttons on the register, ""returned"" a churro officially, and handed me $1.26.

All of that drama might be worth it, if the chorizo didn't taste as bland as watery ground beef. Sorry, Espos, I'll just drive to Someburros a block away."
tWiFat101ID5w_wgAPMXhA,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,1,"Stop charging for refills, Ted's. That worked in 1985, but we all know soda costs you less than a penny.

I like the food a good amount, and it's incredibly petty, but I just hate feeling like Ted's is ripping its customers off when literally every other fast-food/casual restaurant stopped doing this two decades ago."

Just moved back here after 20 years and it's the first pizza place that compares to our favorite NY pizza place back east.  Great crust, great sauce, plenty of cheese.  Simply awesome.  Rosatis is dog food in comparison."

We've been there three times in the last six months, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and the last for dinner.  The got our order correct one of three times.  The last time they got everything right on the receipt, however, the actual order was all screwed up.  My bad for not checking before I left with the to-go order but it was a ton of food and not marked on the styrofoam containers.  Trust but verify, I guess.  Really sad considering the tastiness of their food.  Awesome place if they get your order correct.  The order they got correct was breakfast and I was one of two people there which is likely why they got it right."
oD-C0IhodDOtWWOiNm2txA,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,3,"Food was good but wayyyyy over-priced for what we got.  We're not big on Claim Jumper sized portions but this place had tiny portions for the price.  Ambiance was great & the setting was beautiful.  Staff was very friendly, too."

PZtY6wMyrVHNX6kfhkL7Iw,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,3,"Ate here last sat.  It was decent for a chain.  Had a green chili burro and it was good.  Definitely better than Taco Bell!!  Elmers and Reynosos really set the bar high for Mexican food restaurants, so it's hard for other places to compare.  Clean environment, speedy service, and service with a smile."

We got the crepes, potato pancakes, and crab benedict and it was all fantastic.  We've been to nearly all the high rated breakfast places in Chandler/Gilbert and this place is the BEST!

It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either...kind of mediocre in our book.  We had the moist brisket, baby back ribs, and jalepeno sausage, along with small beans, cream corn, potato salad, baked potato, and finally a little cobbler.  Standouts were the cream corn, baked potato, and cobbler.  We'd give the ribs 4 of 5, but the brisket, sausage, beans, and potato salad were just okay.  Brisket tasted of artificial smoke that was over powering.  The jalepeno sausage was good but no jalepeno flavor and no spice.  The beans and potato salad were just blah.  Neat environment and friendly service."
bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,5,"Totally exceeded our expectations   We ordered pan fried potstickers - they were freshly hand made and delish.  For the main course we ordered kungpao and general tso's chicken which were both amazing!!!  The food was easily as good, if not better than PF Changs at probably 1/2 - 2/3 the price.  We also asked for extra spicy and it actually was!!  Ambiance and decor were nice and the service was friendly and prompt.  We will absolutely, 100% be back.  Our new favorite Chinese food!!!"

Honestly, I don't know why SanTan is so popular...the food is mediocre except for a couple of items.  Next time, try Bourbon Jacks instead of the other restaurants in downtown and see for yourselves!  You WON'T be disappointed!!!"
A1YMl0rf3_05HtnL-1noqg,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,2,"We really wanted to like Pirates but had to mark it down.  Got the fried shrimp, chicken nuggets, fries and onion rings.  Shrimp was fantastic, however, the fries had an awful aftertaste like they were cooked in old oil.  The chicken nuggets were processed chicken and mediocre at best.  The onion rings looked like they were going to rock but ended up being bland with zero flavor.  Really, really disappointed.  We'll drive to Tempe or Mesa and hit up Petes instead."
_Vi33ZAf0hdBn5Cu0AnQig,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,5,"Tried Zoes for the first time tonight and it was OUTSTANDING!!!  Everything was delicious.  It honestly made Pitta Souvli look like dog food.  The lamb meatball appetizer was amazing.  The steak kabobs were seasoned and cooked perfectly, as were the roasted veggies.  Did I mention their dressing is great, too?  My wife had the chicken pita and my son had the salmon pita which they loved.  We will absolutely be back."
eOl6WS3oAjtGZpcXfv8tlA,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,4,"Really good Thai food!  We got a mix of curry, padthai and another chicken dish.  This is the first Thai place in many years where the food isn't over-powered by fish sauce.  There's still a hint (hence the four stars vice five) but not too bad.  We ordered takeout so can't comment on the service, although, our food was done on time."
HM0sWlwg3ONJ6syMSh_9zw,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,5,"Been here for work on three occasions and #loveit.  Had the filet and ribeye and both were 100% better than The Keg and Ruth's Chris!!!  Appetizers and side are delicious, too.  Very nice environment and vibe, too.  Perfect for a business dinner or romantic evening with your significant other.  Highly recommended!  Can't wait to bring my family here.

Update:  had a family dinner at Fleming's last night to use up a gift card.  I ordered the 16oz prime dry aged ribeye.  It was good; nice and tender.  However, it simply lacked the amazing flavor of the DC 14oz ribeye.  I think DC's put a little more char on the steak and again, DC's ribeye was so much more flavorful.  Fleming's ribeye was $62 while DC's is $29...Fleming's was totally NOT worth the money.  Choose DC's and pay $29 for a steak that tastes like a $62 steak should!"
zvB0Vzhomsodw_iQ7FHY1Q,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,2,"First off, let me say the food is delicious, five star level BBQ!  Rated two stars because I ordered the brisket meat plate at $16.99 and my wife ordered the brisket sandwich at $10.99.  Guess what?  The sandwich had just as much brisket as the plate.  The only difference between the two was the plate came with an extra side and one less slice of toast.  That's it for an extra $6.00.  RIPOFF!!!  Morale of the story is save some money by ordering a sandwich instead of a plate!  I was so happy to have great BBQ nearby but this left such a bad taste in my mouth that I probably won't go back."
PWjaIjXAXXfs_I4TnAfvtQ,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,5,"Pizza and wings were excellent.  Thin crust and the wings were perfectly crispy.  Only downside is limited parking but that doesn't affect the great food.  Makes Rosatis look like garbage.  The price is right, too!  This is our go-to pizza place now.  The owner is super friendly and the service was great."
cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg,ZwwtUAcTl8DqbwW731j5Cw,4,Great food a decent price.  Made from scratch in front of you with a smile.  The green onion pancakes are awesome!  We'll be back!

Ribs were all fat and looked like they were a couple days old.  The meat on the sandwich had an artificial smoke taste that was overpowering.  The macaroni and cheese was runny, too.  The only thing good was the fried okra.  Thoroughly disappointed.  Don't know how this place has four stars."

c7lAaz-pW58i1h1rSlyqcw,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"Republica Empananda has the best Empanada's that I have been able to find any where in the states! This is a family run business with the owner and his family working there daily to create delicious homemade,  from scratch empanada's, salads, and beverages. I ordered the Hearts of Palm salad that had a Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette dressing that was to die for. The salad was quite large and could easily feed one person for lunch. I opted to split it as an app with my friend so that we could both sample some empanada's as well (they're in the name after all, so they have to be good, right?) We also split the Jalapeño Popper Empanada and the Cubana Empanada. Both were A-MAZING. The Jalapeño was filled with grilled jalapeño, potatoes,  and cream cheese. The Cubana was delicious chunks of ham, pickles, and mozzarella. Both were quite scrumptious and I would be hard pressed to say that I had a favorite out of the two. The crusts on both were light, buttery, and flaky, not heavy at all, and added to the over all experience. 10 out of 10 would recommend everything I had and I will be looking forward to going back to explore the rest of their menu.

The entire staff was very personable and friendly, the dining area and kitchen were clean and aesthetically pleasing, and they even have a cute, well shaded patio (for cooler months) that backs up to a nice community garden.

This is a little drive from the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area, but well worth the time and gas to get there."
FsCujpVh9Za2Dl5MIYLCxA,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,1,"Honestly I'm surprised by all of the good reviews for this place. My bf and I decided to give this a place a try since it's fairly new to the neighborhood, and it was the most bizarre dining experience that either one of us have ever had. Our server was nice.... But the menu... I shudder a little just thinking about it. It had everything on it from a quesadilla to ketchup covered spam. Not being totally scared off after viewing the menu, we decided to order several things to give it a try. We ordered some steak kabobs and chicken skewers to start. The steak kabob was neither a steak nor a kabob. What was brought to us was a hamburger patty covered in what appeared to be teriyaki sauce with a little wooden fork stuck in the middle. Again, it was a hamburger patty.... and didn't taste like a very good quality one either. Feeling adventurous we pressed on and tried the chicken skewers. These didn't taste bad, but were definitely the gristly parts of a chicken that you wouldn't normally want to eat. Unfortunately we had already put in an order for an entree, we even were talking about just asking for the bill and canceling the entree, but right as we were going to ask for the check, our food came out of the kitchen. This is the ONE instance where I wish the service had been terrible and the wait long. But unfortunately, like I already stated, the wait staff was great. Stuck at this point, we faced our entree (which was one of their signature dishes, the Kkanpungi). We both hesitantly dug in, and were mildly surprised. The chicken quality was better than the skewers we had already had and the flavor wasn't terrible. It was coated in layer after layer of sugary sweet sauce though, and we could only eat a couple pieces each before we threw in the towel, asked for the check, and promised each other we would never come back to this place and ONLY recommend it to our mortal enemies."
2HKQSZxgfixCLRZQLHdo-A,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"Unique gourmet hand crafted ice cream flavors, great service, and a cool vibe.

Stopped in here after a bike ride to replace all of the calories I had just burned off, I got a scoop of the Urkel (extra points for the Family Matters reference!) which was a combination of chocolately goodness and peanut butter awesomeness in my mouth. My BF and partner in crime grabbed a scoop of the Netflix and Chill (subtle hint for what he wanted to do for the rest of the day? I think so.) His selection was also delicious. It was vanilla ice cream infused with popcorn and also had peanuts and other movie goodness mixed in.

As an added bonus, the patio is dog friendly.

The owner was very friendly and personable. I will definitely be returning to support this local business and to explore his other delicious creations."
ytAsW7DYezxMMzqoO_-nIQ,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,3,"The good: Large open patio, cool understated decor, and friendly servers. My Moscow mule was expertly crafted and one of the better ones that I've had in the Valley area, my bf and friend also seemed to enjoy their beer flights as well.

The bad: the food was subpar. Between the three of us, we ordered the pork belly tacos, the filet mignon truffle tacos, beef short rib tacos, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, and an order of the truffle fries. The pork belly tacos consisted mostly of tough pork meat with only a little delicious pork belly. The beef short rib taco was dry and lacking flavor, the fish taco appeared to be filled with frozen fish sticks and a bone was found in one. The filet mignon truffle tacos and carnitas were all right, but nothing worth ordering again especially  since we live in one of the best states to find great tacos. The truffle fries were shared between the two guys, and they didn't seem to eat many of them, so I'd guess those weren't winners either.

Conclusion: I wouldn't say that I wouldn't return here, I would return to grab drinks with friend to either watch a game or pre game before going out in old town, but I wouldn't plan on eating a meal here again."
Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"Great fast service here! My coworker and I stopped in here for our lunch hour and were happily surprised to be seated immediately. We explained to our server Barry that we had limited time and had to get back to work, put in our order, and before we could get to deep in conversation, our food had already arrived. Barry was friendly and was even great about getting us our check right away so that we could get back to work on time.
Would definitely recommend."
Xg5qEQiB-7L6kGJ5F4K3bQ,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"Amazing BBQ with crazy lines worth standing in. We showed up about an hour after they opened and still ended up standing in line for over 2 hours before getting to the front and placing our order. All though it was a ridiculously hot Phoenix summer day, the wait was well worth it. By far the best BBQ in town."

The location is nothing fancy, and neither is the decor inside, but the staff was friendly, quick, and professional and the food was amazing.
I ordered the Burger Brûlée which had a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, and havarti cheese, so far, I haven't had a better burger in Phoenix. As a side I also opted for the sweet potato tater tots, again, not disappointed. My coworker stayed simple and ordered the Paradise burger and fries, she said the burger was worth coming back for and I tried her fries and the in house seasoning they use is very yummy, no dipping sauce needed for flavor!
Looking forward to returning to explore the rest of the menu."

It's always nice finding these local small businesses that are delivering something delicious to their community. This is mine and my S.O.'s go to place for tacos in the Uptown area. Their fish taco is amazing, but honestly, so are all the other tacos on their menu. Definitely order extra salsa when you go in so that you can sample several of their gourmet salsas because they are worth the extra $. The owners, who are husband and wife, are always there every time I go in and are very hands one and involved which is nice to see and makes it an even better dining experience."

Managed to sample several different dishes from the groups plates, and I'd say the best thing would have to have been the wings, but again, nothing special. Go for the decor, drinks, experience, and music and maybe grab dinner elsewhere beforehand :)"
mnwRtuVQEsIUomBchu0gwg,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,4,"I LOVE that I can take my dogs here and enjoy food and beverages with my friends, more bars need to be dog friendly ;)

Food here can go both ways, sometimes it'll be the best thing I've ever eaten, and other times it's just okay. Of course, this could be effected by how many mimosas or beers I've had. (more alcohol=AMAZING food). Except the chicken and waffles. Those are delicious pre and post booze :)

Service is always great! Just be prepared for a wait!"
J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,4,"Always great to find a place that serves a great Green Chile Cheeseburger!

Service was also great, only thing not great about the experience was that the chairs in the dining area were slightly uncomfortable by the end of the meal."
fN7ds9Dk4IfMsh4RT9x82w,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,Fantastic! Visited this tasty sushi place again and they definitely have tightened up their service and have fixed all of the minor issues I witnessed with my first visit when they were just getting up and running. They still do not have a liqueur license but should have one before the end of the year making this a hot spot for the old town dining scene.
2G8YLx7J8du260jFNjIjZQ,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,4,"Reasonably priced authentic Mexican food at a local mom and pop place. The lady taking my order was very friendly despite there seeming to be a slight language barrier. I ordered three street tacos, the pollo, asada, and carnitas and got them to go. The smell was intoxicating in my car during the drive, I had to fight the urge to eat at every stop light on the way to my destination. I wasn't disappointed once I was able to eat them either. Very flavorful, good quality meat, and expertly cooked. I would recommend to others and definitely return to explore more of their menu as a quick lunch go-to."
NWjJK9c5YOQSbMX_bw24sA,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,4,"As far as seafood in the desert goes, this place is great, however, having spent many years on the east coast, I've had a taste for amazing seafood, so I'm a little judgementy when it comes to all yummy morsels from the sea.

I had heard great things about this place since it had opened, so when trying to decide where to get lunch on a Saturday afternoon, my boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try finally. We rode our bikes over (with my dogs) and the entire staff was very accommodating from the moment we arrived. They showed us where we could put our bikes and invited us to sit at the perfect table on the patio with the dogs (BONUS! DOG FRIENDLY PATIO!). Our server was very friendly and service was prompt.

We ordered the oysters, the Inner Harbor Crab Cakes, and the Fish n' Chips to share. The oysters were delicious and made me very excited for the rest of the meal to come. The crab cakes were advertised as Maryland Style, and all though the flavor wasn't bad, they were disappointing. Maryland crab cakes should have lump crab meat in them, these were shredded. Also, they lacked that nice dear or the outside that gives them a nice crunch. These were almost mushy throughout. The fish n' chips were tasty, all though the fish was a little greasy, like they had been fried at a low temperature.

As far as I've found in the valley so far, this place is great to get my seafood fix, I'll be interested to explore their menu further, especially after the oysters. If you're from Maryland though, and are looking for a great crab cake like I've been since moving here, this is not the place to get it unfortunately."
fpq8H7tPv8gK3me02NASfg,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,1,Terrible! My office has ordered lunch from here over the phone multiple times and not once have they actually gotten the order right. EVERY TIME we've been missing multiple items from our orders. Save time and go to corner bakery or zupas.
6ON9B6DsL5cUnPmIy8A06w,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,1,"Terrible! Stopped here with a coworker for our lunch hour and when we walked in there was a sign that said to ""please seat yourself"", so we did. All the ""free"" tables were dirty with dishes and food still on them, so we had to stand by one while a server cleaned it off before running away. We then sat and waited... for 15 minutes. During this time no one came by and offered us water or a menu. My coworker got up 3 times and asked different servers each time if we could get a menu. 15 minutes into sitting and no one had actually come to our table to even drop off a menu. We saw multiple servers on their phone's standing by the bar texting instead of actually doing their job. We ended up walking out and going to Perk Eatery in the same parking lot where we got seated and served right away and were still able to make it back to work before our lunch hour was over. Skip Zipps and go somewhere else. ANY where else."
CFyPbqZaxoBTjOmVjSn_8Q,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"Being a self proclaimed street taco virtuoso and making it a personal mission to try tacos at a different restaurant every Tuesday for ""Taco Tuesday"", I must say that this place has been the best that Phoenix has to offer so far. The menu is limited, but I honestly wouldn't change it because everything on it is delicious. The service was also fantastic, the owner himself did all the cooking and serving and was very personable.

The location could be improved, but the sense of danger adds to the ""Taco Tuesday"" experience.

Only thing I would say is that the dining area needed to be cleaned a little and you guys definitely need a website so more people can find your place and eat delicious tacos."
r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,Delicious and great service! Tried for the first time last night and was not disappointed! Split a Chicken Pesto Sandwich and The Il purista Sandwich with my S.O. and both were amazing. I can't wait to explore the rest of their menu and plan on going back to check out their wine selection and and grocery.
pHpU8lnnxMuPWRHOysuMIQ,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,2,"Meh, there are better places to get your Sunday brunch on.

I went here (for the first time) with a group of girl friend's for the Sunday Brunch that they serve, and as a group, we left disappointed. We were informed that they were completely out of their benedicts because something was wrong with their ""egg poacher"". I'm still left wondering how their pot of boiling water was broken in the kitchen. Between the seven of us we ordered the hummus nachos, the bacon grilled cheese, the skillet, the grilled chicken pita, one of the burgers and the salmon avocado. The hummus nachos arrived first, and even though every where online, on the menu, and on giant posters on their walls the nachos were depicted with five pieces, ours arrived with only four. The Salmon also arrived completely different than pictured or described on the menu. On the menu it says it's on a bed of seasoned arugula, mine arrived on a huge spinach and arugula salad that was mostly greenery. I tried the salmon and it was WAY over done and completely dry, it had the consistency of what I imagine cat food would have. I called the server over and asked for it to be remade, she told me that the salmon was all precooked and that the wait for a fresh piece would be way to long. I've cooked salmon many times and if they actually have fresh salmon in the kitchen it shouldn't take more than about 7 minutes to make a fresh piece that's done correctly. But I didn't want to play around with a kitchen that clearly couldn't cook salmon and was unable to poach an egg so I switched my order to the bacon grilled cheese because it seemed simple enough and hard to mess up, plus two of my friends were already eating it and said that it was pretty good. My sandwich finally arrived and was actually delicious! I was commenting on it and the two friend's that had the same sandwich asked if there was a tomato on my sandwich. There was, and it was delicious. Turns out their sandwich was delivered not only without tomato but also without the garlic aioli that mine came with. They tried mine, called the server over, pointed out the mistake with their sandwich and got it taken off the bill. That's three kitchen mistakes so far if you're counting, plus the disappointment in their inability to simply poach an egg. Service was slow, it was hard to order drinks. The one saving grace was that our server was able to split the bill correctly and did correct the mistakes by removing the one sandwich from the bill and getting my replacement order in quickly.

All though the bacon grilled cheese (when made correctly) and the bloody mary were both delicious, I would go else where for my dining options in the future. If you're going to pay for service and a meal out, it might as well be a 5 star experience."
G4LzA_UqrzcZ5gAyWWP2sw,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"This is one of my favorite lunchtime spots for three reasons: delicious sushi, fresh fish, and always quick and prompt friendly service. Their prices are also more reasonable than other sushi places in the area."
l4pAkHCVUKAcDvo-iNSbYA,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"Great quality fish for a very reasonable price, I'd have to say I'm hooked! Cod it was good. Eely eely good :)

Loved the Chipotle style, create your own bowl line service that they have going on here! Both my boyfriend and I each ordered the Regular size bowl (which comes with two scoops of your choice of fish), and it came with so much food that neither one of us could finish our own individual bowls. Definitely not skimping on their servings. I did White Rice, spicy tuna, salmon, with spicy creamy sauce and ALL of the toppings. I don't know that I would change my order at all when I go back next time because it was delicious, filling, and financially satisfying. My boyfriend opted for the half salad half rice as the base of his Poke, and he said that coming back he'd change it up and just go for the rice. (He thought when he ordered the salad that he was actually ordering the delicious seaweed salad that is actually one of the toppings, poor guy missed putting it in his bowl at all! Luckily I like him enough to share my food with him and ended up giving him most of mine. If that's not love, I don't know what is.)

Over all it was a great experience. Delicious food, fast and friendly service, and a clean establishment."
7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,1,"Maybe I've been spoiled by great food in my travels, but everything I had here was sub par. WAY to expensive for a terrible steak. Also, I asked for it to be medium rare (as all good steaks should be) and it came well done, no pink. A note for the chefs, if you're going to be cooking at a steak house, please at least be able to cook a steak."
2KadiQLTen9_mN_dXgKR5A,s7qRpzKianC6cxq1nJWeaA,5,"Freshest fish you can find in Scottsdale. This is technically a fish shop but they also do a limited poke bowl menu. It's a little pricey but well worth it, by far my #1 place for the freshest fish available in the area."

Great room for an intimate show, staff is great, prices are reasonable. I'll definitely be back many times in the future for concerts. I'd probably eat dinner else where beforehand though."
QsMR_Fp9YRtDegThsOgFLA,RuV3cTAii5xLFiVfszZI-g,5,"No country for old buffet. The banter over tapas will never end just as my love for Sens with their ""infusion"" of different Asian styles and ingredients. The tofu, the cold duck, sweet & sour soup and fried quail were amazing. Add to that their wide selection of sake and it is heaven on an ill bloated stomach."
DL7V1_chkWkZtyG4_xNYfw,RuV3cTAii5xLFiVfszZI-g,4,"A great place to grab a bite if you're out of time and happen to be downtown. Notable dishes which I recommend are the Spicy Korean and Tai Mango Chicken. I mean if you really wanted to try something spicy, healthy and delicious, you wouldn't be gnarling those Big Macs, would you? Plus, Zoe's is just going to take forever and I don't think you want to eat at a greek IKEA.

- Time is but an illusion--lunch time, doubly so
- Do tai chi or yoga before you find a parking spot
- Grab as many fortune cookies as you can without feeling guilty"

Just the Tips:
- Roast beef sandwich is mostly awesome.
- They have AZ wines if your man-meter doesn't sink to skunky beers.
- If you want to talk to your pretty lady and retain your voice, sit outside.
- For you veggies and squirrels, the mixed nuts and olives are well portioned."

My favorite is the chicken pita #2 which is a pita jammed with chicken breasts, feta, grilled onions and fresh veggies. Sure there are sandwiches and salads but I can make those at home. Let there be meat!

Tips:
Choose fruit or pasta.
Ask very politely for pita chips instead.
If you are retarded and can't build a sandwich, try Sack's.
Place cake into mouth, not onto face."
fSFzgt_QzJRUN0qNzTAwig,RuV3cTAii5xLFiVfszZI-g,4,A great place to chouch out downtown. I was reluctant to try the grub. Georgie told me to try the grill cheese and tomato soup. I did and I liked it. This place gets packed early so make your trip to Lost Leaf earlier in the night.
jq9gzjKbVWgeMYzA0aFzxw,RuV3cTAii5xLFiVfszZI-g,5,"Lola, on Roosevelt, is my favorite coffee shop in the Valley. They roast their beans on location and the quality of the coffee is superb. Jency and Lisa are the best baristas; always friendly, even if the last patron is the largest bitch or Richard. The tables and chairs are solid and comfortable; totally put Lux's lawn chairs to shame. And, lastly, if you are craving a treat with your beverage, they have the best baked goods. Overall, I don't any other place for coffee where they know your name, your drink and how to make your day."
CS3zMyq39AuGnOQO9RYLGw,RuV3cTAii5xLFiVfszZI-g,3,Yikes! Spinach dip was super salty (more like salt-lick) and bruschetta is a cheap Postino clone. At least the Bree plate was okay.

BA2tYMpTHR3i7X-6qtcWaw,RuV3cTAii5xLFiVfszZI-g,4,"Let's not get too crazy with the five stars and Vietnamese food. It's hearty, affordable and fast. It may not be savory but, however, remains delicious for both humble and economic reasons. And that's okay, because I want to experience different cultures and their cuisine without all the American influences.

Tasty offerings include the (#3) beef with egg roll and their ""pho bo.""  The beef is seasoned ""awesomely"" and comes with fried spring rolls over a California-king-sized bed of rice noodles and greens. As for the ""pho"", it is a very delicious soup that you must try at least once in life.  Lastly, compliment your meal with a Tai tea or Vietnamese coffee and you'll leave much more caffeinated (and perhaps happier) than you arrived."

Bring your own cigars.
At least try a shot of Middleton.

Try Seamus, Rose & Crown or George & Dragon for TPE (true pub experience)."

I recommend trying a few of their 150 varieties of rum or a cocktail such as the Mojito Jamaica or Jamaican Mule. The drinks can be pricey, however, at this place, you finally get what you pay for.

Try the For de Cana 18yr for a rum with the finish and nose you'd expect from a cognac."

The soup was very bland. I had been very excited about this prospect because someone in an earlier review said it was awesome. It was more watery than anything. The sushi was actually bad. I remembered picking it up and it was dripping with liquid (the sashimi).

They have a sign that says something to the effect that if you don't finish your plate you'll be charged 20% more. This isn't right since half their stuff is flavorless (the stuff we had).

$30 for two people on Sunday for lunch at this place was not worth it. We'll stick with Osaka, pay $20 more, for great food and service."
sAN_1jFisdABjadmlDV_zA,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,3,"This place is ok. I have now been here twice. Both times the crab ""stuff"" they have looks decent in the pan/tray but when you start eating it you may find that it has the taste that its been sitting there for a while...hard parts where it should all be soft, etc. Some things are kind of bland. The soups, possibly for the lack of people going to them, have that filmy stuff that forms over soups when they haven't been touched (particularly the hot and sour soup).

Most of the food is just ok. Unfortunately, living out in east Mesa presents many issues when seeking some good but affordable east Asian food. Like in a Treehouse of Horror Episode from the Simpsons, the one where Homer accidentally creates a time machine from his toaster...when he finally thinks he's back home and see's his family eating with their lizards tounges, eh.....close enough."

The lunch another time was similar. For that we sat at the regular tables by choice. Just gotta note that the host guy for that day was very strange as he kept hovering around and staring at people as they ate. This was on a Saturday around 2."
3BGzRYh6GQbZz3LGAGb-sQ,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,3,"Service is hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get a really good server while other times you'll get a terrible one. Those terrible ones consist of waiting for what seems like 20 minutes for your drink order to come, then another 30 for your food, all the while they're off doing who knows what. The manager is probably the most customer-friendly food service manager I've seen. If he catches wind that you're not having the best service he's there to make up for it.

Aside from that its your typical sports bar.

I was here in May 2014. You used to be able to sit yourself wherever you wanted but now they have it set up where they seat you. I guess that works for them because they're regular dining area is kind of cut off from their bar area so servers may not realize people are back there.

Food is alright. Some things aren't worth the money but it is what it is. I think its Wednesdays in which they have 50 cent wings if that's something you're interested in."

Would be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it."

One problem once that I had was that I came in just as lunch was ending, the server and the hostess had me down for dinner, but I guess the sushi guys weren't informed of that and thought I had come in for lunch. One of the sushi chefs complained to the hostess that I was going for items from the dinner side. Nothing came of it as the hostess told him otherwise, I just found it odd."
QvEoE_oGwHPXvw5IylllNg,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,1,"Been here a few times and have always been ""off put"" by the place. I called in for a pickup and the lady taking the order sounded very annoyed. After hanging up I venture over there and the same lady didn't acknowledge me at first. I went to pay, and just as she swiped my card another customer came in asking a question about the food, something like is it too salty. The lady was clearly annoyed again and would answer with condescending logic like 'well if you order something salty then it will be salty.'

While I was waiting to pay earlier I can see the cook(s) in the back on the phone while cooking. The kitchen doesn't look very clean at all.

An earlier time I had been in there, their soda machine wasn't working and only had water in a water jug available...which was out. There weren't any drinks on there. I should've left as I was dine in that time.

Another time I was dine in, I guess the owner and his/her family decided to eat on the center table, which is cool I wouldn't care but they were staring at my wife and I the whole time (and we stared back).

And still another time we ordered delivery. I put the tip in the order online. The kid shows up and demands a tip. He takes out his phone to call the place to make sure I had put the tip in then maybe realizes he's being rude and just walks away.

Pretty sure I'm done with this place. And it would make me a happy man if I can even dissuade one other person from going there."
NYTe202AJmEynCj4STfRow,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,2,Unfortunately our food came out cold and they didn't have time to fix it I guess. There are some good options for their food but nothing really seemed appetizing to begin with.
N_ML37GOTOLtGKWqRnbJRA,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,4,Has a diner feeling. The food may not be incredible but its good in my opinion. The service is among the best for this type of place.
OugQjN04sQNahWzYEdTExQ,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,3,"This place is strange. There really isn't any other way to describe it... It's like a tiny little store (that only sells strange Norwegian candies and cookies) with a deli attached to it. It has folding tables in the center of it that are connected to one another so you can make a new friend at lunch (I guess), or have the staff stare at you while you eat (they didn't do that, but it still feels odd to eat there). The whole place is very small, and the deli area is wallpapered with sloppy white sheets of paper advertising different lunch options.

Let it be known, the food was very good. BUT, the place looks kind of dirty, and desperately needs someone to come in and make sense of it. The only issue that I took with the food was that they microwaved my hot sub. It was good, but I feel like microwaves belong at home. Just my opinion."
wHq1efQVz17338k_aUOX3w,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,2,"Two thumbs down. The atmosphere is great... But waiting an hour for a $10.00 sandwich that you could have made at home is not. This place is good for people who want the ""Starbucks experience"" without regard for time or taste."
nSrLMVCShkos5msyVaQAFg,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,3,"I went to Kincaid's for their $10.00 lunch special that includes a drink and your choice of side. It is a very nice restaurant with a great atmosphere, but the food is kind of blah (depending on what you get). The French Onion Soup that I ordered as a side was FANTASTIC! One of the best that you will ever try. But my main dish (chicken walnut salad wrap) was just lame. Mayo and shredded chicken with some shredded lettuce. I would imagine that their dinner menu is much better, but I doubt that I will be back to try it."
_DPJ_PHJnXsuhYhsgBA0Xw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,5,"Eating at Durant's is a great experience. You feel like you're in a mafia film because of its history and decor. The food was excellent, service was excellent, and the overall experience was excellent."
DvY_J2gFxudK9HC8kjI3NA,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"Great Deli. I had the ""New Yorker"" which consists of pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing on an AMAZING onion Roll. Would go back just for the roll! Everything that I had was great but the prices are high ($8-9 for a lunch plus the drink)."
vdZOiZH9sTseyll44waMuA,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,1,"I have decided that I hate this place. It was almost a hard decision because their baja sauce is awesome, but there are so many things to hate that I have to be the ""Paul Revere of Yelp"" and warn all of you good people.

They are sneaky little weasels and want to take your money. I ordered a baja burro and the server asked ""with guacamole and sour cream""? While she was nodding her head. So I said yes. The bill came and I was being charged an extra $4.00 for sour cream and guacamole that I didn't even use. I know what you are thinking, ""that's your fault, she probably asked if you wanted to add it,"" but that is not the case. Same thing happened at dessert, we ordered the deep fried ice cream and we were asked if we wanted chocolate or regular, so we picked chocolate (the menu doesn't say anything about chocolate costing more money), but sure enough... A teaspoon of Hersheys is another $2.50. Fast forward a week later, the same thing happens to my coworker at the downtown location, they pay an additional $4.00 for sour cream and guac that they didn't even use. I am under the impression that the servers are actually trained to ask you in a way that implies that it is included to jack up your bill.

Look, their food is okay, but the prices are absurd. You can find much better Mexican food at half the price all throughout the Valley. Hell, you can go to Outback and have a steak, salad, bread, blah blah blah for less money.

The decor is old and tacky, the last server we had hit on my wife while I was in the restroom... Seriously, he said ""He left you? if I was your man I would never do that to you, I would treat you like a queen."" Yeah, okay Macayos guy with your extra $4.00 that you stole, go on with your bad self."
zfmLt7AK03Q5QrzUFKCuaA,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"How do you review a National chain like this? The food is...well, Chili's. If you like eating at other Chili's you will like this (duh). I give it four stars because it is very nice on the inside and not nearly as tacky as most other Chili's, the atmosphere is cool and modern."
e880MGw6C6PJL-n3EJoY_g,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,2,"it is very nice to have a healthier alternative during lunch. That being said, the food really isn't that great and is WAY OVERPRICED. My small pita sandwich (comes with a side), and drink was over $10 bucks. You can go to Paradise or Subway for a whole lot less. Not only that, but there is never any parking available, and most of the menu items are completely bland. Drop the prices and add some flavor to the food."
1n3hAKaOajANcMQZOt1IOg,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,3,"My wife and I really enjoyed the food and the salsa. We also had very good service and did not experience any of the negative things that I had seen on Yelp. That being said, I have to mark them down because their prices are absurd! It's Mexican food- tortillas, chicken, beans, and cheese... You can't charge me $13 for that! That is more than my steak, salad, and side at Outback... Twice the price of a meal at Costa Vida (which is a Mexican grill in the same strip mall)!"
v2O04EnpcSvWc5hkiWrZZw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"Breakfast was fantastic! The Snakebite Scramble has the most incredible pork chili (like a dark chili verde) that would rival 9 out of 10 breakfast places. Prices are reasonable, and we had great service. The yelp reviews make me cautious to try it for dinner, but you can take my word for it- breakfast was great."
FcvWRrwhjIqktji6iLpaUA,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,3,"The food is pretty good, but you certainly pay a premium for its proximity to the stadiums! Prices are a little high."
xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,3,"Green Chili Stew is intense and fantastic! If you can handle spicy foods- I would say that this is a must try! Only knock on this place is that it is tiny and not ventilated very well. There is a lot of grease trapped inside of this small restaurant, and you will smell like fry bread for the rest of the day. That being said, it is worth it!"
5RRfUPmRboHNydASWEnANw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,We heard back from red Robin and they did a great job to make our experience much better the next time that we went.  I really appreciate their efforts to improve and provide great customer service.
RsREl3LkFGiwbt3kGIX4Eg,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,2,"I really want to like this place because the food is pretty good and they have vintage soda brands, but they make it pretty tough. My two biggest issues are the price and the employees. If you want a sandwich, side, and a drink you will be paying $12-$15. It's not a ""sit-down"" restaurant, and the prices are absurd for the portion size and quality that you get. It's not that it isn't good- it's that it is not worth the price. Problem #2 is the staff- they make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by placing your order and giving them money. I think I asked about what came on a sandwich and I received a long sigh and one finger pointed up to the menu, but the menu doesn't tell you...that's why people ask questions. I don't need a deep conversation or anything, but respect the people the are keeping you in business.There is better BBQ in the valley at a much better price, this place is popular because of its location."
ST66dWiUqYnvrD7zT4QBNw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,5,"Tried Rito's for the first time last week (thank you Yelp) and was very pleased. The food was excellent, the place was very clean, and the service was outstanding. I had the red chili burrito enchilada style and loved every bite. There isn't a lot of flash (no secret ingredients or unique options) but the quality is very high and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get.

I should also mention that they use certified Angus beef, which is pretty impressive for a small burrito shop in Surprise! Will definitely come back!"
X6YpIqhaP_qoSZJRBcivGw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,1,"Had a bad experience... Found a chicken bone in my burrito, food took 45 minutes to come out, never saw our server, and it wasn't busy at all. There was no excuse for the terrible service and wait times, let alone the bone that I almost broke a tooth on.

The atmosphere is kind of cool, but they could care less about you and it shows. We finally asked to speak with the manager (I have never done that before in my life), and she quasi apologized and informed us that she would discount our bill- When the bill arrived she deducted a whopping $4! That was less than the burrito cost with the chicken bone. This place must be kind of good because of all the positive reviews, but I would NEVER recommend going to this place."
_r-OvLO5wqncmsBCg3i0qw,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,"Ate here for the first time, I was excited to try out a new Italian place in Gilbert. I think they might still be working some kinks out like most new restaurants do. The pizza was pretty good the crust was great! The house made pasta was just ok... I think for what we paid I had higher expectations. Hopefully they can work on a couple things and we will return."
iCjZlOs3qL1_HhAQBW9smg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,5,The best sushi I've ever had! You would not expect it but don't judge a book by its cover! I don't know how they do it but everything I've had is amazing. My one complaint is that the restaurant is so small... There are seriously probably 8 tables? So sometimes you have to wait quite a while. It's worth the wait!
bfg4i-aq1rzc3M6mmPIU5Q,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,5,Finally got to try this place with my husband and it didn't disappoint! The inside of Barnone is beautiful! I love the industrial look. It's a little hot during the AZ summer heat but it was ok. My husband had pizza and I had the farm salad both were really good and we will definitely be back. The menu isn't very big but they will deliver your food to you at the brewery or winery.
Sy75QB18Sv-xNp8FoA8KvQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,1,"I was here last week with 3 girls friends. It was a Wednesday night so it was not very busy. We ordered some sushi and drinks. I had the only Chardonnay they offer and the second glass tasted pretty off like it was old.  I had each one of my friends at the table take a small sip and everyone agreed there was something wrong with it. When I told our server she took the wine and said she would bring me a new one and she did.  A few minutes later the ""manager"" came over and was asking ""who had the wine"" and he had an attitude about the way he asked. He wanted to let ME know that it was the same wine and nothing was wrong with the first one. I said well it tasted off and instead of apologizing he proceeded to tell me it was the exact same... pretty much trying to make me look stupid.  Definitely wont be back unless its happy hour and I won't be getting any wine. I am giving one star for management. The food and other service would be about 3 stars..."
tKi4OvAlckcVzeP92InsOQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,The theater itself is nice and has really comfortable recliners. The food is blah. We ordered a margarita pizza to share it was bad and had no flavor. It tasted like I was eating plain crust. I will return to see a movie but I won't bother with the food it's not worth it.
wMOioy2KAoI2AnpbqwxdOg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,"Ordered take out last night, it was my first time eating from here but I was in the area and heard good things. I ordered two rolls the salmon love roll and the lollipop roll. Both of the rolls were really good, the fish was really fresh. It took over 40 minutes to get the two rolls. But I will definitely be back to try more."
DuQtouEXOfo5K4ukON3qwQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,We have been wanting to try this place as it is right down the street. I am so glad we did! The food is not your typical Mexican food and they have a lot of choices. We split the blue corn enchiladas and a cheese crisp. All of the salsas are really good too! I had a skinny margarita which is sweeter than I usually like but overall he service and food was great and we will definitely be back!
DzZbZR7zgsho_XM6mhOCZg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,This place is really good! I came here for the first time and got an iced coffee and their BLTAA. The coffee was so good and the sandwich was amazing too! It came with a side of fresh roasted vegetables. I can't wait to try more things on the menu!
MVHGmZEwtKrXH11ySGweEw,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,If you like seafood you must go here! Some of the best calamari I've ever had and in Gilbert! We had great service and great food. They have Happy hour specials too!
NFHlMOEyVsbqY_VQNJFafQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,"Ordered takeout, upon first appearance it's not really a place I would want to stay and dine in. It's very dark and not very  welcoming. We ordered pizza and pasta. We ordered a small pizza but they gave us a large and the price of the pasta was $4 more than what it said online. I'm not sure why???? Anyway the pizza was good I will probably continue to only order takeout.




Second visit.... Messed up our to go order again.... Wow!

Unfortunately we ordered takeout again and surprise surprise the order was incorrect. The service there is absolutely terrible."
sWwCwjsd27k0Y8m1RIWZEg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,I had an amazing birthday dinner here. I am still craving the sticky buns which they bring you before your meal. The food was amazing the service was also excellent. I will definitely be back for another special occasion! The food took a while to come out but our server was apologetic.
zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,"Came in during happy hour so a lot of things are $1 off... We ordered the guacamole, shrimp coctel, and carne asada torta. Everything was really good and it was definitely more than enough food for two people. I can't wait to come back!"
vrKcFQPxj1Zzyj93yl-t6g,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,I love coming here! This place is really fun for big groups! The only problem is you can't make reservations and on weekends the wait can be 2 hours! I think they should take reservations even if you need a credit card to hold it.
2zBCxn7_jHcfxoSjBdHJ3A,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,After reading all the good reviews I decided to finally give this place a try. Came in on a Friday during lunch hour... Big mistake. I waited about 15 minutes for one sandwich. There was no where really to wait for your food the inside is very small. I got a #6 it was ok I've had better. Oh and they forgot my pickle....
PebX-Sf_h4FJGgsRAA5Fng,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,"I'm am giving 3 stars for a combination of things. The food I would probably give a 4 and the service a 2. We had two pasta dishes both were very good. I asked to see the dessert menu before our dinner came out and our server said, ""we usually bring that out after your meal"" I said ok. After the meal she brought the dessert menu and I was full at this point. Then she said ""well you said you wanted dessert earlier"", almost mad I didn't want anything. I will probably give this place another chance and hope I get a different server."
ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,"Came here today with a friend for lunch because she had told me about the mango margarita. We sat at the bar and when we ordered the Mango margarita the bartender said they were ""out"". I was kinda bummed out and when we asked what other margaritas were good she said she didn't know because she's only 20... Not sure why you would have a bartender who can't taste the drinks. Overall the food and drinks were ok nothing to write home about."
tzEMKoLQY-ZEE6r0FO_OgA,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,5,"First time eating here today, we will definitely be back! The staff was so friendly and the owner even checked on us. The potion sizes were huge we could definitely have split a meal. I'm glad we found this hidden gem in our neighborhood!"
xR1gLCH5resvtq1eV1nebg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,"Great patio and restaurant for big groups. They also have a lot of TVs for people who want to watch football. My burger and sweet potato tots were really good. I'm not sure the name of the burger I had maybe the truffle burger? Everyone that ate a burger in my group enjoyed it. I will definitely be back for another adult milkshake, the oreo milkshake with vodka and baileys is addicting, you could taste the alcohol just enough but it wasn't overpowering. I will definitely be back!"
zP4AIAtAXfI0YK8TJmIlRQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,1,"I don't know why I decided to give this place more chances. I came in tonight and got steak lettuce wraps, it was the special and recommended by staff. I have to say I am not impressed, I barely ate half of them. The meat does not even taste like steak and I was given 4 small pieces of lettuce, not worth $11.00. Now I am sure I will not be back."
iqL35L6AdFMMkRrAcK1uLQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,I usually come here to grab a quick lunch from the salad bar or deli. The deli area sometimes gets crowded and if numbers aren't taken it can get kind of hectic. I love their salads and soups but I do not love the employees working there. Multiple times I have encountered rude employees at the deli counter when ordering something as simple as an iced tea. I'm a friendly polite person so it throws me off when someone gives me attitude for ordering an iced tea with lemon.... That's all....
Fv3HvJPQYqfmniTgtIQJzA,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,5,I love everything about this place :) especially the fact we can ride our bikes here! The only downside is there is not a lot of indoor seating. The breakfast and coffee are great you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
gugN1sgyheBJ6aKtNcv_gQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,1,"Worst chorizo I have ever tasted... Never again!!! I ordered the Arizona omelet and it was covered in ""ranchero"" sauce that had the worst flavor. I will never be back."
Lz6QUlFkVKtnzSISk0WUPw,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,4,"Came here for the first time last week and it was great! I was disappointed because they were out of a lot of things but we ordered shrimp, muscles and lobster. We had the trifecta sauce and mild seasoning. I would definitely come here again and try other things. Be prepared to get messy!!!!"
u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,5,Postinos is one of my favorite places to go monthly for a light dinner and wine. I get the bruschetta every time and I am never disappointed. The servers are always very knowledgeable on wine and will give you a great suggestion. I have had some of their Panini's and soups and those were also delicious! The Arcadia location is also my favorite Postinos to go to; I love the atmosphere.
Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,1,Will never be returning to Picazzos! My pizza had a hair in it and the mushrooms tasted slimy. The service was even worse! I wish they had better food because I live very close by. It seems like I'm not the only person who had bad service maybe they need to look at these reviews...
4_XrzTImR7calqcE6Otyaw,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,Decided to check out the new sushi place downtown Gilbert because my husband and I were excited to go somewhere different than our regular Postinos or Liberty Market. We ordered potstickers and 2 sushi rolls. We actually sent the potstickers back they were so bad. They were soggy and all dough. The rolls were ok nothing I would I would need to try again. The sushi is actually pretty expensive.... $14-15 for specialty rolls. I would be willing to give it a second try and maybe order something different.
7MeMGh0SUlF-GuTyruwtcw,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,5,"This place is a happy hour gem. First off, their staff is amazing. Marlena is very knowledge and always has good recommendations when it comes to their large selection of alcoholic beverages. Happy hour gets you half off drinks and appetizers. I'm there every Tuesday night! See you there!"
p6EUf6c9GCfG7seS_wfFyA,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,"Definitely a place to check out. The burgers are a little small but perfectly presented. I had the sloppy Joe (wasn't so sloppy but nonetheless, it was good). This place also has a bar area to grab a beer or a cocktail.  You gotta try this place at least once."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,"This place was really good. I had a hop knot and a kilt lifter both full flavored beers. I liked the hop knot more cause I love IPA's. I had a the four peaks cheeseburger and that was awesome too. The outdoor seating was nice.

Oh yeah, if you like the beer, yo can purchase a jug to go. I'll definitely be back soon."
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,5,The best pizza in the united states according to several magazines. The owner bakes each pizza himself. The wait is a bit long but you can grab a glass of vino next door at Bar Bianco. Well worth the wait and price. Excellent place to take a date.
PZtY6wMyrVHNX6kfhkL7Iw,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,5,"Someburros has amazing chorizo, enchiladas, chimichangas, salads, churros, and pretty much anything else you'd want. I love their original Tempe restaurant, and the Chandler restaurant is just as good.

The staff is great and the place is clean and inviting. I couldn't love it more (I come almost once a week.)"
TkgEHV_4Qmamb_wUvkgdTg,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,5,"I've already gone to the Biscuits location in Chandler about 30 times since they've opened, and I was happy when I saw this new location in Tempe closer to my house. This location is a walk-up, counter system, which I actually really like.

I can say that they excel in everything I would hope for in a breakfast place: the food is great and  the atmosphere clean and inviting.

All of the french toast options are amazing (especially the Almond crusted kind) and the omelettes are solid (although the chorizo is on the mild side if you're opting for that.)

I love this place and hope it has a long and successful future."
tIauOelAC3BZk_xhMoDBUg,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,5,"Great local place that has a flavorful, solid menu, and an attentive staff. I go here once a week and get either a chorizo cheese crisp, beef enchiladas, or a chimichanga. They're always busy and they're the best casual Mexican food in the Valley."
muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,5,"Our office goes to Tahoora at least once a week and it's not hard to see why: the amazing food and excellent customer service. I've tried, at this point, almost everything on the menu, and everything is always fresh, delicious, and authentic.

Some of my favorites are the Bandanjan Eggplant, Goat Karahi, and the Chicken Byrani, but the menu is solid all-around.

We've gotten to know the owners just because of the sheer amount of times we go and they are really delightful and always incredibly friendly."
nfdNvM0HFCDmnJ5eHMnuNg,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,3,"I ordered the cheesesteak (which is made with brisket) and although it wasn't bad by any means, it was pretty average. The fact that it's also $10.99 makes it less than exciting. The fries are straight out of a 1950's hospital cafeteria. They're so bland they shouldn't be offered.

The clientele was older: probably 60-80 years old on average. The vibe is completely that of a cafeteria.

The restaurant has been around more than 50 years, and although it's sad to say it, it won't be around for another 50. This type of food, cafeteria-service, and interior is going to fade away as the generation that supported it eventually passes on. If you're under 60 and not from the east coat, this NYC Deli/Cafeteria shtick isn't going far with you. With the many sandwich options surrounding this area, I can't ever see why I'd come here again, unless it's to soak up the nostalgia for a simpler time, when food standards were less stringent and the way to order food was with a tray in hand."
4jPerp3OfFiWgBPQi8SOUw,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,5,"Amazing cold brew and cold drip coffee. The vibe is solid, the coffee is great, and the folks behind the counter are friendly and incredibly helpful. I was given a few samples on my first visit, which helped point me in the right direction, and now I've gone back every morning this week.

My only wish is that they would stay open until 8pm on Saturdays. This is definitely the place I'd like to hang out with a cold brew and relax before heading to Four Peaks."
BqnxN4hHahZ-zZGXDDGLsg,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,5,"One of the greatest bone-in ribeyes of my life. I've traveled the country eating my way through some of the best ribeyes one can find, and yet still BLT Steak just hits it home. Also, the pop-overs they serve are incredible. This is my go-to place in the valley for an amazing steak."
5GoBfhIyEN-BMzVjO5QLeA,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,1,"On May 2, 2013 a group of friends and I came here to grab a burger before a movie.

Four of us became incredibly ill only hours after eating here and we were all sick for 3-4 days afterward. Two of the other members who came with us did not get ill.

Apologies, I would have written something more timely, but just getting around to it now. I've eaten at other Red Robin's before and never had an issue. It appears it's just this location."
hHtOsr-NMviBKlMqDBeI9Q,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,3,"I love the food (aside from the green eggs and ham omelette.) My only issue is the noise. The size of the place is part of the issue, but generally the employees are loud and the place just seems to encourage a very ""barking"" atmosphere. Very tasty, but I'd like to see them work on creating an ambience to match the food."
5A_sjC9ULLt4UkDNtr9dkw,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,1,"A few of my friends and I, after having a relatively underwhelming experience at their Scottsdale location, decided to try and give the Indian school locale a shot. We arrived on a Saturday night, around nine, so that a few of us could have a beer and the others a coffee. We saw a decent looking crowd inside, but as we approached we discovered a sign that notified us that Sip was closed for a private party. We came back a few weeks later, and watched as the owner sat at the bar, hanging out and taking loudly like a frat boy, and found his demeanor to be fairly annoying. At first we thought he was just an loud customer, but only later realized he and his wife are in fact the owners. I can't say that the coffee was anything special, but I can say that I won't be returning, because the odds are either that the place will be closed when they should be open to the public or you'll be sitting around listening to the owner as if he's in his own living room."
PRbIMseOwPCCRv5C4SfTDQ,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,5,"Delicious. Sure, it's at Tempe Market, which isn't exactly a culinary mecca, but the BBQ is solid."
umrDQGRNied77aVg29_fVw,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,3,"The Apple fritter was great, but the chicken was just okay. I was expecting flavors that were a little bit less sugary and more flavorful and subtle. Still a fun spot, but not something that I'm going to be craving on a weekly basis."
piHJq_NDrOh5SYk3AyQVOg,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,2,"Bottom line: the food is average for the vibe/price point they're going for here. You're better off going to LGO for a better tasting option in the same genre.

I ordered an egg/bacon sandwich which was fine, but average. My girlfriend's salad had old avocado and was generally bland and unexciting. The chicken in the salad was particularly dry and unappetizing.

You can't spend more money on decorating and establishing the look of your restaurant's brand than you do on the food."
in3zjiaLpNzr9G3K35gAJQ,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,2,"Three of us arrived on a Sunday for breakfast and there was no one to take your name or create a list of who had arrived first, which caused some chaos.

There were two groups in front of us who were doing some minor squabbling with each other over who should get the next available table. I walked in to the main counter, and a waiter approached me. He told me it would 10-15 mins for my party of three.

I went back to the patio and waited in line. A man and his parents arrived after us, asked me where they should put their name down, and I told him to just inform a waiter you're here.

After about 20 minutes (and now that we're next in line) a table opened up and the man with his parents just walked over and sat down. I followed, told him we were next in line and he just responded, ""There is no 'real' line.""

That guy was clearly a schmuck, but the reason it happened was Vincent Market Bistro had no system to create a list for who should be seated in order of arrival. Considering that even the IHOP has mastered this concept, one would hope Vincent can get a grip on it going forward.

To be fair, the manger came over later and apologized and gave us a mountain of free deserts. But, he had no real response as to why there isn't a host or hostess to keep people happy.

The croissants are amazing, the ham and Gruyere omelette was average, and the service was decent (once we were seated, which we did ourselves since no one offered to seat us at anytime.)

Kinda crazy, but for the hassle involved, I'd rather just go to Snooze down the street. It's an hour wait there, but at least they have a hostess."
DF6kMTHYuKKME_00AinR-w,CCuB98X_LjCts0Fno3xTJA,4,"A great vibe, friendly staff, some fun live music, and  delicious food. The sandwiches are on the sweet side (lots of sugary sauces) but they are tasty. Love the locally roasted coffee and the cookies."
2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,Delicious tortas! Very popular spot here on Yelp.  Recently on Man vs Food. This place is definitely a gem.  Wish they served beer haha. Me and my friend ate for under $20(not including tip). Which is pretty decent considering it was a sit down place. This place is worth a day trip if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican sandwiches.
4670Yw1xIefONEViw5NDFQ,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,3,"Burger Mania huh? Well this place has a mean Chicago style hot dog. I've also tried their breakfast burritos and they are really good too. You can also choose from gyros, hot wings, seafood, burgers (duh), pancakes, the list goes on. The building is an old Wendy's conversion.  The place is filled with Chicago decor. Overall its a nice quick bite to eat."
LtNgP4FqXp5nMFOHErK8cw,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,The sushi here was good. Wish they had more rolls on the happy hour menu. I really liked how small this place was. The sushi was awesome and the happy hour rolls were reasonably priced.  This is a popular spot so get there early to avoid the lines...
pWqtTbQsXMBevsKbyNgPcQ,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,3,"I stopped in on my lunch break.  The BBQ isn't bad for a fast food type of place.  I had the brisket on this particular visit.  The BBQ sauces weren't the best I've had.  If you are in the area and looking for BBQ, I recommend Pork on a Fork."
Mh2syFX0bG-7vylKY9DE4g,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,5,"Doesn't matter what the service is, this place is awesome. Hippie/stoner vibe. ""Where the only thing fried is an occasional customer"". Toasted subs here beat quiznos in my book."
nZAJ2a2-Oyxt6GzX97i2pg,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,3,"Free breakfast everyday from 9am-noon. (With the purchase of a drink) 3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, hash browns, and 2 pieces of toast. Good stuff. Can't beat the deals here. Worth your time!"
Gq3OgSd5KflKuwNJmuWt7Q,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,Calicos is the spot to be at Westgate. The night life here is awesome. The ladies are everywhere. I definitely recommend trying this place out. You'll probably run into me here. Good drink specials and celebrity guests. Can't go wrong heading to Calicos.
5o6qOFzZ4NrJ6bJ39ohCtA,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,This place is right across the street from my work. All the meat used here is Boars head.  The place looks really clean and smells delicious!  I asked the owner what his reccomendation was and he mentioned the Philly Cheese Steak. I really liked it. This place also has several breakfast bagels that look amazing.
GHs7grPeyVPwmiVKhhfMvg,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,"I don't see why everyone is giving Westgate such a low rating.  Yea, it's a little pricy.  What are you expecting? We aren't eating at the neighborhood McDonalds. Yea, it's on the Westside of town.  If the drive bothers you, move closer. Maybe that would improve your rating a little.  Westgate has a lot to offer no matter what side of town it's on.  I like the variety of places to choose from. Whether you're looking for a place to eat, looking to get your drink on, or in the mood for some shopping; Westgate has it all.  I usually gravitate twards Westgate on Fridays and Saturdays for the nightlife, (see my night hawk badge? haha) where you will find a bunch of twenty-something and thirty-something club/bar hoppers looking to have a good time.  Sundays during football season are awesome.  Tailgating on the lawn is probably some of the most fun I have at Westgate. If you've never been, you have to try out this place."
eDlgbI0Qg_mmI-Osvci0gw,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,"Good sushi in an awesome, modern enviornment.  Their happy hour is actually pretty decent, It was definately fun on a Firday night, They will also shuttle you to a bar or a club or your choice (even as far as Old Town from here). This is a great place to take someone special to celebrate an anniversary or even a first date."
RtnTbhWYw4QjKhoTBV37OA,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,Great place for draft beer. Also good spot to pregame at. Food is pretty good. Pizza here is nothing to brag about. For the most part probably one of my favorite places to just sit and have a beer at Westgate.
825nC-s-cQG6Hsul5Gm2cA,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,5,"Love it, love it, love it! I'm here every Friday, that's why I'm currently the DUKE!  The staff is awesome at P on a F, they are all really friendly.  The only complaint I have is my shirt stinks like delicious smoked BBQ the rest of the day. I order the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries. I'll be in every Friday defending my Dukedom and stuffing my face!"
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,"I walked in to the hipster vibe. I liked it. Very modern. The pizza was good, nice wine list. In all I'd say I'd take a lunch date there."
VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ,AMUkdysVWCSOC8eQyOSYuQ,4,Great food! The wait is worth it. I order the whole hog for my family of 4 and we always walk out with enough food for a meal later.
VLDFjeqpUgWhnVuB_8GuEg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Very clean and healthy menu with lots of wonderful looking drinks.
Great outdoor area and fantastic service. I had a delicious Bison Burger with Kale and Sweet Potatoes. My wife had a Salmon Garden Salad.
Definitely a place to check out if you're around Scottsdale!"
p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"They have an awesome inside area, but we opted for the outdoor seating. Complete with misters. Great Classic Rock playing everywhere and more TVs than I could count.

If it were at all possible to have too much of a beer selection, this place would be guilty.....But we all know its not!
Incredible selection of beers from around the world and our waitress could easily be called a Doctor of Brews! Melody is her name, beer is her game! My wife and I are pretty educated on beers and she simply knew more!
We started with a Belgian Flight, they were all very good, but the La Trappe Quad was the standout. It was the most aggressive Quad and was simply amazing!
We started off with Kung Pao Calamari w/ brown rice and it was delicious. From there, I went for a friend's suggestion of the Pastrami Benedict Burger with Mac & Cheese. Let me say, interesting and huge. Cooked to perfection. Burger, Pastrami, Fried Egg with a delicious creamy sauce. Mac & Cheese was simple yet yummy!
My wife went for the Blue Crab Cakes and loved them. Crispy and fluffy at the same time.
When the check came, we were still happy!"
y3otpml08iLWdX5RCrWnbA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Came because Yelpers really liked it. It seemed a bit more ""assembly line"" than I have been eating around Phoenix, but was still very good. Just sort of lacked that ""grandma in the kitchen"" feel.
I kept it simple with a couple chicken tacos and a few rolled steak tacos. Added some chips/salsa for good measure. They have a great little self-serve salsa bar with 5 different salsas that were all very good. Mild to Spicy, couple green, few red.
The Tacos were huge! Piled with Guacamole and Pico, and some pretty good chicken(guessing thigh meat) The rolled steak tacos were pretty much a taquito from what I know. Service was great and friendly, location was nice and clean. There are a lot of options for Mexican food, this one is pretty solid. East to get to right off The 101 on 59th Ave. I'd probably go back if I were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't drive miles out of my way to go back."
gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,2,This is the third time I have eaten at Iron Chef. Its pretty good sushi and its right by my house.  The server next door at Nicks had told me it was dirty and the kitchen was gross. I don't know why but I decided to try it out again.  Immediately my napkin had a long black hair on it...I wasn't too upset just asked for a new plate.  Then my boyfriends plate was sticky...he asked for a new plate...my soy sauce cup had an old piece of rice in it...asked for a new one of those too...the server kept apologizing which was nice but come on...3 dirty things and we haven't even gotten our food yet! Our sushi arrived and it was ok...it wasn't as cold as I would like which worried me.  They gave us a cucumber salad for free...wow thanks. It's decent sushi for a really good price you just have some risks involved when you go there with cleanliness...
ZRHSidI7IIeXhTHMc9L_gw,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,2,Very inconsistent.... I ordered the southwest chicken salad and it was completely missing the avocado.... it's a $10 salad so you'd hope for everything that comes with it. The drive through can take up to 30 min sometimes also....
WkkuUaYjhfd8I5ckrrBSMg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,1,The last 3 visits through the drive through they have forgotten my tortillas. I know I should have probably checked but I rarely come here and I forget. I won't be going to this location again. It was $18 for 2 chicken meals which isn't cheap for fast food and I at least expect them to give me my 2 tortillas.....
yX0pOWG_Be9TjGnm0aihVA,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,I wanted to really like this place. My friend took me out to lunch here yesterday and upon first look it's a really cute looking spot. I like the open concept and there is and cute outdoor grass area you can bring your dog to. As far as the food goes it was pretty mediocre for the price. We had the hummus starter and two paninis. The hummus was pretty good but both paninis were very dry and not full of flavor. I would probably give this place another try in the future if I was in the area.
HQObn6hrV9WoeFObGfa2YQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,5,"So glad this place opened in my neighborhood! All of the ingredients are fresh and they have a lot of options to choose from! We tried the rolled tacos with green chile beef and a burrito with pork and both were excellent! They don't skimp on the portions either! Everyone that worked there was very friendly, definitely will be back to try the street tacos too!"
BncSpY3IPix5s-4SOHCtLQ,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,1,"I wish this place was good, it's not. I've eaten there many times and the last time was my last. My miso soup was cold I had to send it back... All of the rolls are a different version of a California roll and don't taste fresh to me. I went with my husband and for 1 appetizer and 3 rolls it was about $80.... That's without any alcohol too! We've added to our list of restaurants we don't eat at. Hopefully something better will take over soon!"
9ibMbke1qYbmhJ2Qf3tWfA,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,3,Tried this place for the first time and had the general tso's chicken and beef lo mein. The food itself tasted great and I thought we found a new Chinese take out place. Unfortunately I was extremely sick that night and the next day with food poisoning and my fiancé was as well. The service was very friendly maybe it was just a fluke?
FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,2,We went on a Thursday night around 6 PM thinking it would not be busy.We were quoted 20 to 40 minute wait but ended up getting seated after an hour and 15 minutes. There were about 5 open tables when we got seated. Our server came by once and we ordered everything at that point. He never returned to see if we needed anything else not even another drink. We never got our waters we asked for as well. Then we had to hunt him down for our check which he brought 10 minutes later. I won't be returning. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my tacos were good.
wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg,AIgS-xHC1YL-cobhQkMjFA,5,Went here on Saturday night for a date night with my boyfriend. Both of us had never been here before and we were craving some Italian food.  I had seen on the menu they make their pasta in house and the reviews looked good so we decided to try it. I am so happy we did! I had the bolognese pasta and he had the spaghetti and meatballs they were both excellent dishes. For desert we had some salted carmel thing I cant remember the name but it was delicious!!! We will definitely be returning. The service was great too!!!
64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Had dinner here recently and already can't wait to go back. We had the guacamole and queso with chorizo and both were good. I usually love the guacamole but tonight  (it was last Thursday) it was a little too chunky. It was also missing the usual tang from the fruit. It was still great, but I've had better (yes, that's what she said).

We then ordered an assortment of tacos which were all delicious. My favorite was the pork and I am literally salivating at the thought of them. The were perfect with just a hint of sweet. Pure heaven! Plus the margaritas were spot on and the service was friendly."
QsMR_Fp9YRtDegThsOgFLA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Love the saki selection here! The ribs with red curry were really yummy. The wontons with chicken and cheese were ok, the dipping sauces made all the difference. The shrimp dish labeled spicy was extremely spicy and nice with a side of rice as was recommended... although I still wanted a glass of milk to put out the fire in my mouth.

We went on Christmas eve and I have to say that with things pretty slow in there I had the chance to look around... really look around. They need to dust. I'm not saying I Joan Crawford'ed it around with a white glove or anything, but above our head (and our food) the lotus flowers had giant dust bunnies on them. I started looking around at other fixtures and it looks like they haven't dusted since they opened the place. Gross. For the price of those dishes you think you could buy a dust buster!"
E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Yummy in my tummy goes the won-ton soup. It is my go to for when anyone is feeling sick and totally hits the spot with all its veggies. Best in the valley, IMHO. The fried rice is also really yummy here. They don't skimp on the veggies which I love.

Last visit to eat in was a couple weeks ago and the waitress/owner(?) was super nice to us and our French friends visiting from across the pond. I will definitely make an effort to eat in more often instead of ordering out."
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"I can't believe I've failed to review this place! In fact, I'm not sure why I don't go more often. Had a nice lunch today, the burger at medium rare was super juicy and the fries were solid. I had a really nice bloody mary and the $3 price tag was nice. I want to stray away from the burgers and try some sandwiches next time... plus the wall o' draft beers is drool inducing."
MgHWbwuxxb_txhI3lK_bKg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Holy junk! I am a fan of this place. On our second trip here I tried to branch out and order some different things. We got the TMI toast (yum... and almost too much food for a starter), the mac and cheese (praise Jebus) and the BLT (you can't find that thick cut bacon anywhere.... yes.... that's what she said).

Service was great and we had a great bottle of red (Paso Robles something).

We'll be back fo sho."
08_PxnpSJO4Rxt05EYaAxg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,This place has the most AMAZING selection of cheeses. EVER. Boyfriend got me a tasting selection of about five different cheeses for my birthday last year and I was in heaven. Truly amazing variety and all were super yummy.
fP8JqPAVh9MQ2OIlfvsKnw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,2,"Oh no! Where did my Wineburger go?!? I wrote the review based on a hungry tummy and fond memories. Today I went in and it's just not the same. Something happened on January 1st, 2011 because their burgers are different -and bigger does NOT mean better! The flavor was completely missing and the beef was dry. They also do not have cheese pints (curds) any longer. Some distributer issue. BOO!! Also the price seems to be higher.

Fail, Wineburger. FAIL.

The one plus? The service was great. Will I go back? Nope."
aIZQF2UCLv6ru-zsPK4H2Q,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Hands down the best BBQ in the greater Phoenix area. That's right. I said greater Phoenix area. Because it is better than Rudy's (which I heard is getting a location in Chandler). How could I make such a huge statement? How dare I? Because I am from Texas. I know good down home service and food and this is it. Plus my fiance is a BBQ snob (also from Texas). He takes it very seriously (it's a little funny but cute).

We got the brisket and the pork ribs with sides of creamed corn and beans. So good. Top it off with Shiner and I was in heaven. Seriously, I felt like a kid again just after finishing a long trail ride (minus the Shiner, of course). We also got to taste the jalapeno sausage and it was delicious.

I can't wait to go back and try every single thing on this menu. The service was the best in the city. THIS is what good service looks like, Phoenix!! Y'all don't even know!!"
2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Oh my goodness!!! Love, love, love this place. I got the Torta Nortena de pollo and my fiance got the chicken tacos and we were in heaven. The food was perfect. Absolutely perfect. And cheap too! This is our new favorite Mexican place.

YOU. MUST. TRY... THIS. PLACE."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Best brewery in Arizona. Period. End of story.

Great bar food, absolutely awesome beers. My favorites are the oatmeal stout (my winter time pick), SunBru (summer time), and Kiltlifter (year round), and hefeweizen (year round). On the food side, the chicken rolls are my favorite.

Don't miss out on this gem. Beer is supposed to have flavor! Put the beer flavored water down and get to Four Peaks!!"
gHutuGMMMH-5Qv9DbemLFw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"I love Scott's. Pure and simple. This place is a gem from top to bottom. I've been coming here for over a year and food and service is always fast, friendly, and delish.

The bagels are awesome- try the egg bagel. I used to come in every Thursday and eat a bagel, drink tons of coffee, and read the New Times. The waitresses were always very sweet to me and I felt right at home. I also love how they don't scrimp on the cream cheese.

The fiance and I usually have breakfast here and could easily share a plate because it is SO MUCH FOOD! The sandwiches look amazing (again... SO MUCH FOOD!) and the deserts look fantastic.

Try the latkes and the breakfast sandwich with challa bread. It'll make you wanna holla!

...See what I did there?"
gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Really enjoyed lunch here. I got #26, egg noodle soup with pork wontons, shrimp, squid, etc. He got the pho beef soup (not sure of the number) and we shared the shrimp spring rolls. Seriously delicious and great value.

I ordered out another night and got #31 and was pretty happy I got this one to eat at home it was delicious but I made a mess of myself. Clean up on aisle Cookie!

Can't wait until winter... I can see myself eating here once a week!"
wERcL1KznuTgfltSKQt_jg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,1,"Over this place. OVER. I've had too many ups and downs but today was the straw that broke the camel's back. We came in and there was a wait. We waited for about 15 minutes and noticed that there were 4 single guys each taking up a booth- by themselves- in the bar. It was almost comical watching them nurse their beers and play on their phones. While we were waiting on a table so we could get our hangover grub on, we noticed that there were two empty tables (4 tops). Not sure how long they'd been sitting empty, but that was frustrating.

I guess the manager noticed and came over and asked if we'd mind sitting with some other people at those tables. I, being hungover and not wanting to be judged whilst I shoveled unhealthy greasy wings and a burger in my gullet, said no. I explained that we were just there to eat and would not be camping out to watch Sunday football. Why couldn't we have one of the two empty 4 tops? He wouldn't budge and said that's the way they were seating people. I call bullshit. The last time we were in on a busy Saturday, we sat by ourselves at a booth, ate, and left. No fuss. I didn't even complain when my sweet jalapeno burger came out and was missing the freaking jalapeno sauce. I was too hungry and just ate it and said nothing.

Well, I am tired of making excuses for Zipps. Their fries are often flacid. The service is hit and miss. The beer selection sucks. Now they won't even fill their own tables? What the heck?Am I decked out in NFL gear like I'm going to pretend your restaurant is my living room? No, I just wanted to eat. But I had to take my money elsewhere to do that. We weren't the only ones who chose to leave either, I watched 3 other couples go while we were waiting. I'm still pissed we weren't told up front that's the way they were going to do the seating. Instead, we had to stand around and wait. At least those single guys at the 4 booths by the bar provided comic relief."
YauBkH-HEx148jC0pv4Hcg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,3,"Not the best experience for at this chain of restaurants. It was our first time back to Richardson's new building and we were there for lunch. It looks just the same on the inside, complete with the horrible step up as you head left after entering the restaurant. C'mon guys, you couldn't have put in a ramp? Two people tripped on that step as we were having our brunch. We were at the first table as you walk in to the left, right next the the fireplace. Unfortunately, I don't think they had the thing set up right because we were blown with ash at one point.

We got the eggs benedict jalapeno to share because the plates are usually so large. It was plenty of food, but not stellar. The english muffin was cut so the bottom was so thin that it got soggy and flimsy with the jalapeno hollandaise. The meat was supposed to be pork loin, but we were served a big piece of thin ham. Yes, I understand pork and ham are the same animal, but what we got was not pork loin. It was a much cheaper version. For $15 I was not happy. I was happy we didn't each order a dish and get completely ripped off.

The service was not great but I chalked it up to our waitress not having a good day. She came by after we waited nearly 10 minutes to get our drink order and we tried to put in our food order, but she walked away as we trying to say ""and then..."". She also refilled my coffee without asking if I'd like more (my personal pet peeve). I just hate it when the automatically pour in more coffee when my cup isn't even half empty. I have the sugar/cream proportion perfectly set to my taste and you just threw it off because you swooped in and didn't ask. Grrr. She did this twice. I had food in my mouth the second time and don't like to throw up a hand (I think it's rude). Grrrrrrr.

Last oddity was the fact that the charge shows up as ""burningembers"". I couldn't figure it out for a few minutes before it finally hit me. You know, because they keep burning down their restaurants. Bet their insurance is a doosey."
wOk2b8zUHWylJOd6FtNsRw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,1,Got take-out from here last night and it was HORRIBLE! Something must have happened because they only had 3 people working and were VERY disorganized. Should have checked the food before we left! Ordered fajitas and there was very little meat... it was beyond ridiculous. Hardly any peppers but a plethora of what looked like stewed tomatoes. Look... I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla. We called and the person who answered could barely speak English (which is really not a big deal in my book) but there was no manager around to resolve the situation. We asked for an email so we could send a note about the experience but she was unhelpful. All she offered was for us to come back right then...which if you were as hungry as my fiance was not an option. He gets grumpy and I know better than mess with a grumpy-hungry-pants.
NPiLy71qqXzb45k9eQOgCQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Maizie's has been a favorite of mine for nearly two years now and I can't believe I'm just getting around to writing a review. Bad Cookie.

My fiance and I hit up Monday night burgers just about every Monday. We try to wrangle friends out sometimes, but it can be hard when having kids tend to suck them into the vortex of... well... wherever they go. That's fiiiiine, really, cause we just belly up to the bar and meet new peeps and hang with the kick ass bartender Tina.

The burgers are always quick and very tasty. I've started getting the sweet potato fries and they rock. Perfect crunchy on the outside/soft inside. The ciabatta bread the burgers come on is fantastic.

Also noteworthy at Maizie's are the pizzas. Yum. They have a Tuesday special that I wish was on another night because I feel a little weird hitting them up two nights in a row. I don't want to be those people, ya know? The brunch is also fantastic. I just love this place and haven't had a bad meal or bad service here. Ever.

Last, I love how dog friendly this place is. We often bring the pooch and she is always treated like the pretty princess she is. They give her a bowl of water and a cheeto looking treat she loves."
mnwRtuVQEsIUomBchu0gwg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Great beer selection, but we were just in for lunch. I was definitely tempted, but remained a good girl. Or was a good girl for once... potato... pah-ta-tah.

The spinach/artichoke/crab dip was really good. I need to find those yummy yucca chips by the bag. I really liked how the dip wasn't too heavy and cheesy. Nice clean flavors. We then spit the chicken salad sandwich with the side of the gnocci for an extra dollar. The gnocci for an extra buck was a STEAL. Seriously... should I have snuck out the back? Holy crap was that gnocci good. The chicken salad sandwich was super yummy too and I loved that it was served on a croissant.

Service was great and we will definitely return soon. Next time I will get beer!"
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Went here for post dinner drinks last night. I've eaten here before and really enjoyed it (but it's been so long ago I won't base the review on that).

The drinks here are really nice and unique. Great ambiance and I love the Julia Child video. The cucumber drink is yummy. I had total order envy because it was so light and refreshing."
fmyo8-JBOu5bjczEsLJyBA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,Solid sports bar! Went here for the women's world cup finals and had a great time. Bloody mary's were awesome and the appetizers were a nice surprise. The jalapeno poppers were yummy and the sliders were nice too. Service was great and I'll definitely be back...they've got Murphy's on tap!!
X6YpIqhaP_qoSZJRBcivGw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,3,"Really solid lunch deals and pretty close to Tex-Mex which I still get cravings for from time to time. I had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice. It was a ton of food (of course) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a solid deal and I'd stop in again. My only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas. That would be heaven."
S-oLPRdhlyL5HAknBKTUcQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Hands down the best sushi in Phoenix. Yes, I know I've said that about other establishments before... but that was before Harumi.

After a second visit last night we were blown away by how wonderful this place is. Last night we again got the 5 nigiri, 6 sashimi, and we asked if we could substitute the oasis roll in favor of the crazy roll, which they did without hesitation. The crazy roll is crazy good and the fish is the perfect combination tucked into the yummy and unique purple rice. The rolls are just bite site, not those giant ones that make you look like a chipmunk trying not to choke. We also started with the jalapeno poppers, which were light, fresh, not overpowered with cream cheese, and just the right amount of spicy. Will definitely order these again. The last visit we had the crispy stuffed shrimp to start which were amazing- so I think I just have to order both and have leftovers.

Now the fish... the fish is ridiculously fresh and the highest quality. The lines of fat in the salmon and the melt in your mouth as your eyes roll back in your head... yes, I get that I am talking about food. But this is an experience in joy. I wanted to bow a thousand times over to the chef on the way out. Thank you, thank you for coming to Phoenix!"
-yQHIYKXH3HAdhh1W52OMQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"So happy this food truck establishment now has a brick and mortar restaurant. Grabbed lunch here and will soon be back. This visit I tried to have something I hadn't tried yet so we got the corn dog bites, the oliver and hubby got the moki (which looked great, but too messy to share- or he just liked it too much). I really liked mine and the jalapeno cheese stuffed corn dog bites were my favorite. I almost wish that the app only included these and not the plain hot dog filled bites. Luckily for me I think they know this and I think only 2 out of the 6 were the regular bites. We didn't have a beer this time and I spent quite a bit of time regretting my decision because they had such a stellar selection. Great local and not so local craft beers are available. Must drink next time! Also- I miss the fried pickles and the lady hot dog I tried on a prior taste at the truck, so I will have to visit more often to work my way through the menu! Aw, shucks."
cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"We had the Windsor burger which was perfectly cooked, juicy and plenty of flavor. The fiance complained that the caramelized onions were too sweet, but I found it dee-vine. The mac and cheese was also tasty and I loved the crispy topping. We also got a side of veg which was spinach and I wish we had ordered two. It was yummy. Their winter ale on tap (forget the exact name) was surprisingly good.

This place is fantastic...except for one thing. It's a teensy bit over priced. Just a buck or two on each item overpriced. I'm going to need to find the email/text/yelp deals in order to return as much as I might like...or I could just take up extreme couponing so I can go there every week."
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"I love Matt's. I hate the wait. But if you have the patience, it's worth it. Really yummy hash browns, waffles, and I am never disappointed with their specials. Irenia is super nice and remembers her regulars which makes it feel less like a conveyer belt of customers."
M95OX2nED7rjPxOURJtOCg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Had lunch here a couple days ago and I really liked the sammies. Hubs had the T.J. and I had order envy! I really liked my Italian Hero and would order it again, but might bargain for a half sammie switcheroo because the T.J. was really good. We did the Yelp deal and I got the fruit salad and he got a side salad. Both were very good. Service was very friendly and helpful and I will definitely be back."
fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Ordered out here today and was very pleased with the food. I got the Iron Pot (Nabeykai Udon) and it was tasty although I would have liked more vegetables. It had TONS of seafood.

The pot stickers were yummy. Perfect flavor and perfectly cooked.

How'd I not know about this place?! I can't wait to try it again!"
-Bdw-5H5C4AYSMGnAvmnzw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Wowza. This place is G-double O- GOOD. We were with another couple and decided to share everything and I'm so happy we did because I wanted to taste EVERYTHING. We started with the Mac & Cheese (of course we added lobster, cause when they spell it lobstah...you kinda have to), the dates, and the fries/gravy. All stellar. I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy the dates were. For mains we got the chicken and waffles and skirt steak. Both very good but we were all getting pretty full at this point. The chicken was seriously good. Great flavor and we the one breast was absolutely perfectly cooked. I literally just used my fork and it was like butter. The fiance also found his new favorite beer and the manager spent some time explaining the label and the history of it which was really cool. The cookie balls at the end were really yummy too. Who doesn't like balls?!"
V6X1T1DdfUVNIk3AmispDg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Had a great meal here last night. No issues with slow service, although we were there for a fairly late dinner. Service was good and the food was yummy. We had the mixed tempura app, one other delicious one I can't remember, the Volcano, Mexican, and Vegas rolls plus the Deluxe Sashimi. Quality of the sashimi was good and I really liked the rolls. Who doesn't like cream cheese in their rolls?

It seems to me like they were aware of prior reviews commenting on service. At one point we were double teamed by two waiters who could've communicated with each other a little better so we didn't have to answer the same question twice, but no biggie, they were just trying to make sure we were taken care of.

My only complaint would be that the rolls were really big- definitely a two biter. It made the volcano a little difficult to eat, but delicious nonetheless. If we're up that way again, I'd definitely return."
V9bs-9SqhlryOCLy6vk6gg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Great pub where the food is not at all an afterthought. On the first visit, we took advantage of the check-in deal and got the mussels with the shepherd's pie and fish and chips. All were outstanding. The bartender also offered some sauce that complemented the shepherd's pie which was a thoughtful gesture. The thing I loved about the pie was that it wasn't covered in cheese and that everything was well balanced. My husband got the fish and chips and gave me a bite but wasn't all that open to sharing, so I'll have to order my own next time.

The second time we went we took advantage of the happy hour special and got a bunch of apps including the mussels again, crab cakes, wings, and cod sliders. I really enjoyed the cod sliders. The bread was light and crunchy, the cole slaw topping was fresh and the fish was perfectly battered. Such a great combo. The crab cakes were really fresh and the wasabi sauce was a nice compliment. The wings were good- as you'd expect for pub fare. The mussels again were yummy with the spicy broth perfect to dip the homemade bread in. We found out they'll sell the bread by the loaf, so I'll have to do that for a special occasion."
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Finally. Finally!!! A solid British pub. Service was great (more than I can say for some actual pubs in London) and food was absoflippinlutely stellar. We shared the Shepard's Pie, Bangers and Mash, and the broccoli cauliflower cheese bake (yes, there were leftovers). It was impossible to pick a favorite and this will definitely be on my go-to list when in Tempe. The beer list is superb and I had a hard time choosing as there were so many of my favorites from overseas travel. My only wish? Murphy's on tap."
dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,2,"The food was great but the service left a bad taste in our mouths.

First of all, I'm no diva and do my best to be nice to people and not sweat the small stuff. I've been a manager and know how tough this kind of work can be. That said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable.

Upon arriving and not seeing a huge crowd, we were told that it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait. We said ok, we'd like to check the bar. She rudely told us that it was full and gave my fiance the stink eye when he left. I trusted her and waited for him to come back. While I was waiting I overheard a surly exchange between the hostess and customer.

""What's the difference between this bar and the one inside?""
Answer: ""This one is outside and that one is inside""
Seeing the realization on her face that she was being rude, she ""politely"" added that the one outside had a different bartender too.
""What time do you close?""
Answer: Basically a lot of complaining about customers coming in late which was code for ""I hate staying late"". Really not cool. Really bad for business.

Anywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass. It was like she was trying to turn away business so she could leave early. It was only 8pm too!

Enter bartender... or ID Nazi. My fiance is 33 and rarely, if ever carded. No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way. Not what I want to see.

It took forever for us to put in our order and after we got our food and another employee came to sit down next to us we got the full brunt of bad juju at the restaurant. Apparently they've fired two managers recently and are going to clean house some more.

Seriously. Keep your business inside your back room. I don't want to hear about it while I'm trying to relax. Customer service here needs a kick in the pants!

PS: Tell your people to stop yelling at customers on the way out to ""have a great night, thanks"" because it is so insincere that it is worse than saying nothing at all."
OugQjN04sQNahWzYEdTExQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,I lived in the neighborhood for a good year before trying this place. Shame on me! This is mom and pop at it's finest. Great portions of high quality meat and yummy breads. Price is such a good deal for what you get and it's always super fast service. My man and I usually split one sandwich and side and are happy full when done. I love the selection of Boar's Head meats as well as I can't find them at the Fry's down the street.
0nyM_mub7LxN6Dx7tYpMaA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"My ball and chain has been training for a half marathon and therefore, I have been suffering the onslaught of veggies and non-fried fare. So let's just say I wasn't thrilled at his choice for lunch.

And then I ate my words. And my veg.

We started with the summer rolls and they were yummy. I didn't miss the meat at all. The peanut dipping sauce was tasty, although a little thick... which was actually nice. I had the Pad Thai as an entree and the salad that came with it was super fresh and tasty. I usually like my salad served with a side of lettuce and enough other junk to qualify it as not so healthy (hello, blue cheese!). This salad was good and it didn't leave me missing anything. The Pad Thai wasn't as spicy as I usually like, but the broccoli on top made up for it. Ryan had the Chicken and veg. Well, the SOY chicken and veg. I couldn't help but crack a joke about what I like to have when I'm craving some chicken.... actual chicken. I have to admit the soy chicken was good and the texture was stellar. His had more spice and was super tasty.

Top it off with a hot cup of Jasmine tea and I was happy.

We'll definitely be back."
aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!

On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird. It's so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives. Sold! I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad. Lay off me when there's bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister!

First up was the mixed salad. I love how it's not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit. It's the perfect balance of flavors.

We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly. I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops. The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous. The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime. Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name. I just smiled."
1rebduwtmrHQhl32djRS7A,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"I love the feel of this place. Very cool vibe. It's truly a hidden gem. If you don't know about it, you'd drive right by. It faces 15th Ave and parking is in the back. Just be prepared to drive around the block to find it and you won't be sorry you did. It's worth it!

Let's talk meat. Nice thick slices of meat. They don't skimp round here, y'all and me likee. My fiance and I shared the Super Sicilian and it was enough for both of us plus a side of potato salad, chips, and a green salad. The potato salad is good- nothing fancy just simple yummy goodness. The toasted sesame seed buns are heavenly.The simple salad is a little skimpy for the price tag, it could use some darker leafy goodness or some jazz. But I don't mess around with the salad. I want thick delicious meat and potatoes. That's right. I wear the pants.

Bonus points for serving beer here. Double bonus for serving Moretti instead of Peroni."
pDewiJY6KCcZgLxxgxg13Q,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Just when it seemed like I couldn't be impressed by a Mexican restaurant anymore, here comes Comedor Guadalajara. When so many others stopped offering free chips and salsa while you wait I was SHOCKED by not only getting chips and salsa but a cup of soup while waiting for our meal. We went in for lunch, and while we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, the service was awesome and we were in and out quickly. They do not mess around here and I was thoroughly impressed. The food was close to the Tex Mex that I crave from home and the value for the money is solid. The chili rellanos was killer. Will be back regularly!"
2Yq-Y-tDroP7mdDfcWJLCQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"This place is the bomb. Yup, I said it. I ordered 3 barbacoa and 3 carne asada and they were both delicious. The onions and peppers were such an awesome treat to go with the tacos and at $1 each, such a sweet deal. The guacamole sauce was also really nice. Why are you still reading? Go! Nuff said!!"
D3dAx-QW_uuClz4MambeHA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,2,"I love the food and coffee here (although I would double dog dare anyone to actually commute anywhere while trying to eat the commuter breakfast sandwich). Long lines? I can deal with those. But for food/coffee this expensive why... WHY are there tip jars out? Please explain to me why I need to tip... for someone to call out my name? Really? Are you not paying your employees enough? It's ridiculous. I hate tip jars. But the service is always good so I feel like a jerk for not tipping, which results in fewer visits here. Seriously, your price+tip=way too much for what you get.

Also, what's up with the disappearance of the small yogurt granola? It's not on the menu and missing from the refrigerated case the last couple of times I've been in there. Boo."
yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Had lunch here today and it was pretty good. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and chips and it was solid. Nothing that overly wowed me. The chips had a good flavor... just a little overdone. Service was good but the refill on ice tea was slow. No biggie, I wasn't dying of thirst.

I was torn and almost gave it 4 stars, but overall it was just A-OK. That said, I will return.

URG! Edit to up it to a 4 star review. I just couldn't leave it at a 3. It deserves a 4. For real. Bad Cookie."
PbTh7aX0_yyaXFOXAlhI4A,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"We put our name on the long list for Matt's Big Breakfast and headed out to get a cup of coffee. The coffee shop at the grocery store across the street was closed on Sunday so we ended up here. The coffee was great and the menu for breakfast looked good, plus I was starved.

I am so glad we stumbled on this place! We got the Irish Fry Breakfast and a side of pancakes. It was spot on. Having had an actual fry breakfast in Ireland this really was good. The black and white pudding was stellar and I wanted more. The soda bread was yummy and the pancakes were really solid. The meats were really good and everything was perfectly cooked.

Was I upset that we missed out on Matt's? Not really. I would definitely choose this place over Matt's again. I don't feel guilty (even though I know we'd hurt Irenia's feelings) because when we walked back by our name was still yet to be called and the same tourists were waiting outside.

Suckers."
6eCbK0Fg9N_DbdluVQx-pA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"I've been twice and have been very impressed both times. The sushi is very fresh and I really appreciate how the rolls are cut. This sounds weird, right? Stay with me. Usually I feel like I'm going to choke on a piece of sushi because it is so large and I don't really enjoy the flavors as much as I would if the pieces were manageable. Alright... go ahead with the ""that's what she said"" joke. This review is asking for it.

But this restaurant is fast becoming my favorite for sushi. The service I have experienced has always been top notch.

Can't wait to go back for Sushi Tuesdays!"
iBihgoxc6Ot7m2D4D3z0QA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,2,"Went here for trivia last night and the place was pretty slammed and we ended up outside the room where trivia was being held in an awkward lean over the bar and try to hear area. We had two high tops pushed together and the rest of the group was at the bar. It made for interesting relay of the question/answer. The bartender seemed really nice- but for the people at the high top, we really didn't get service unless we got pushy about it or got up to get it. It would have been really nice if a waitress would have helped up our tables or if the bartender could have relayed with someone to make it happen, but alas it did not. So I just had one beer when I would have ordered more and didn't order food. You wait so long to order then you just get frustrated and don't want to spend your money there anyway. I stopped somewhere else on my way home for a tasty burger (not my first choice- the pizza looked yummy). Shame- I wasn't the only one at the table who under ordered because of the snafu."
vlJsF5tTfplbo1D5kbUPmQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,3,"The pizza is fantastic. Super yummy and close to the house for takeout. The price... no ma'm. Way too expensive for anything beyond cheese. It's a shame, I'd have this pizza once a week if it were a little cheaper."
h96UFhWMM6k2xGgvmMoszg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"I've had lunch here twice and have really enjoyed the food. My first visit I got the rimpolla sandwich and it was tasty (and enough to bring half home for later). Yesterday I had the penne alla vodka and it was good. Nice and spicy which I wasn't quite expecting. But me likee. I also tasted the rigatoni alla fiorentina and it was light and creamy. The fiance added a meatball and it was yummy.

I'll be back but I wish they served wine. What... it's a lunch only spot? ....Oh. Well... I'd still like some wine. It' not like it's illegal to have wine with lunch! :p"
XvTBQotmJpVPjPNaMM7qLA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,I was in the neighborhood and craving some healthy food...thank goodness I spy Pita Jungle. We shared the Spanakopita and while it's not a lot- it is under $4. My favorite was the feta cube that was served with it. YUM. Best feta... I want to buy it in bulk it's so light and delicious. We then shared the chicken shawarma  which was perfect and the grilled vegetable side which was a little too peppery- but still very good. It was a very satisfying and filling meal and great for keeping up my energy for the rest of the day. Weee!!!
RU2VtVZG8to-XVEHD-2qag,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,3,"I'll admit it, I did not want to like this place because it took Palate away. But we went for Saturday dinner and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be super cheesy (really... with a name like Local Breeze?! Really?!) Thank goodness there was no Jimmy Buffett playing or we would've gotten the heck outta dodge. The music was good, but the atmosphere was missing something. Oh, and people. It was missing people. The place was practically empty! On a Saturday night. Uh oh. Too bad, cause the patio is really nice and they offer s'more makings over their fire pit (what... $7 is a bargain for that...right?) There is also a bean bag toss game (thank goodness for free) with a bar right next to it ($5 Kiltlifters... hmm...)

This place has potential, but needs to work out the kinks. Why the bathroom is dirty when the restaurant is empty is beyond me. Seriously guys, are you too busy to clean that up?

The food: The pork chops were a miss compared to everything else ordered. The tilapia (lemon) was yummy and the broccoli was perfection. The lavosh was solid to start. The fish tacos were good. The clear winner of the night was the Fire Island sandwich. It was freaking good and I will be back for it. Hopefully there will be other people there as well."
pKiSzUlBBRNEdTML24piXA,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"This place was fan-flippin-tabulous. I can't believe we haven't been here before...maybe it was the big Roman dude out front.

It was the usual Saturday night debate on where to go. Chow for the salad? Too far. Dick's? Too much greasy cheese. Then I remembered hearing great things about Centurion (mainly about their pizzas). Of course, we had decided to have pizza the night before and weren't in the mood for more pizza. Oops. Oh well, let's give them a shot.

The wine list was nicely thought out, it's so refreshing to have someone choosing wines that they have a passion for. It definitely shows and we got a great wine from Alsace. I'll definitely hunt down more for the house.

We got the seasonal salad with cous cous, salami, spinach, tomato and lemony dressing. This salad was absolutely perfect for summer... and beyond. Seriously... it gives Cowboy Chow's salad a run for its money.

Next we got the mushroom risotto and the gnocchi with shitake dijon cream sauce. The gnocchi was seriously good...lick your plate good.

I am so glad I remembered to mention them! We had leftovers and I can guarantee someone at our house just might lose a finger. Just saying."
Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Absolutely fantastic. I could close my eyes and I was back in Rome enjoying a Margherita. It surely helped that I could actually hear Italian being spoken when I closed my eyes.

In addition to the Margherita we had the Pomo, the Crocchette Pugliesi and the Mista salad. The crocchette was just like I've had at a street fair but I was a little jealous that they were out of the Arancini, which are my favorite treat. Too bad, but I will be back and next time I will save room for dessert."
NwVj3tbEcR2F8fbrcOEV0Q,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Been back a handful of times since I wrote this and felt I should update. Service has improved and it seems that they've updated their menu so that the spinach dip's description more accurately matches what actually is served. Not positive, because I haven't had the balls to order it. I found another gem on the menu called the parmesan fries. Holy lord! Very good. The wings were also solid. Still no hefe on tap- hopefully they'll bring back that gold goodness soon. Hint hint!"
TQ-FgDYJbJhIXTvSdv-jUw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,3,"Just an A-OK for me. Maybe it's because I'm from Texas and my BBQ standards are ridiculously high, but this place just wasn't memorable for me. We went a week or so ago and the most memorable part was the service. We got ribs and brisket. I liked both, but not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back. The potato salad was really yummy and I enjoyed the jalapeno cornbread quite a bit."

I got the gyro and lentil soup and the fiance got the chicken shawarma, lentil soup, and a side salad (the Fattoosh salad). It was all really good but I think the chicken shawarma was the winner. The lentil soup is also amazing with a bit of squeezed lemon and pepper. I could eat it all day long. Also, the prices can't be beat. Super duper deal."

Seriously, I'd get married here if I could."
6nbmlMVmbifIjrEEbCaA6w,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,You MUST try this place. It is wonderful! We shared the zeljanica (spinach spankopita thingy) and the sausage sandwich. Both were amazing. We also had turkish coffee... it blew my mind. I was so pleased by the way it was served. THAT'S how it should be done! I keep meaning to get back soon and savor another turkish coffee and a zeljanica all by myself. Because I don't want to have to share!

Had a wonderful dinner here last night with my man. We had Moretti Rossa just like we were in Italy last year, which was nostalgic and fun. Then we shared the mixed salad which was nice. I swear if I had a bigger purse I would've swiped the cute balsamic/olive oil holder. I mean, allegedly. We then had the Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach which was super good. It's probably a good thing we live outside their delivery area. Too bad, guess we'll just have to come back!"

They were phenomenal. I will be back... soon. Hold on to your butts."
ymtJtXwsJUClLNDepV1piQ,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"Reservations were running behind on Valentine's Day, but we managed to snag a seat at the bar while we waited. It took 20 minutes to get a drink from the bartender. By the time we got our drinks, our table was ready. The service was great. We started with smoked salmon as an appetizer, which we enjoyed. The lobster bisque was delicious. It took a long time for our entrees to come out. I understand the kitchen was probably slammed because of Valentine's Day, but other tables were getting their entrees much faster than we were. One steak was over cooked (ordered medium rare plus and delivered closer to medium well) and the other was under cooked (ordered medium rare plus and delivered medium rare to rare). The only flavor the steak had was the char on the outside, and I was disappointed to learn that their steaks aren't even prime! They are choice steaks! We added a lobster tale on the side which was good but a bit over cooked. The lobster Mac and cheese was great."
DMyoxEaTGTakZxWgh1D5bw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,We had a lovely lunch with great service and great food!  The scallops were perfectly cooked.
46hnat0aLao-qYWZkN9aBg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"WHOOO-EEEY!!! This was some SPICY food, without sacrificing the flavor.  The salsa, both red and green, had a great kick to it.  I ordered the enchiladas dinner, which comes with a fried egg on top!  It was delicious, and so spicy that I was crying!  Thank heaven they leave a pitcher of water on the table!  Can't wait to try something new next time.  Bring it on!"

emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"Blue Burrito is very similar to Baja Fresh, but healthier.  I'd recommend the shrimp burrito.  You order at a counter and get your food when they call your number.  My only complaint is that for the price, you should get a side besides the chips and salsa bar.  Also, love the stamp card option."
YaEPtPnEqh3WSsGq7cL44Q,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"This is my favorite chinese food restaurant in the valley!  It is SO good!  The eggrolls are huge and incredible.  They offer a traditional Chinese food menu and also Americanized Chinese food.  I'd eat here more if they took credit cards, I always forget to carry cash."
G8vA6pq4p8KslaURm-q65Q,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"Not sure what all of the hype is about... I would much rather drive to Del Falcos in Tempe/South Scottsdale.  The sauce was rather sweet and the sides were overpriced (over $5 for a small side).  Overall, it's alright."
xyMZdF9Xh9N6il831_Czsg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,1,"I wanted to like this place.  The decor was cute when we walked in, the restaurant is a converted house, and the owner of the restaurant was the only one working besides a hispanic girl in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, the food and service were very bad.

The owner was our server and we sat inside.  We purchased a groupon for the four of us, and he immediately had a negative reaction when we said we had the groupon.  (We purchase groupons to try new places, tip well, and often order additional items/services... That is no way to react to a customer).  He then started complaining about all of the groupon customers that he has had, saying that he turns people with groupons away if they don't have a reservation (even though people without groupons are able to walk-in without a reservation) and how people with groupons try to rip him off.  I thought that was a rude comment considering we did have a groupon and were in no way like that.  He made sure to get the groupon before we ordered, and I pulled it up on my phone.  He made a rude comment about how I only had the iPhone 3G while I pulled it up.

It then took a long time for him to come back for us to order our wine.  When we asked him for recommendations for sweeter wines, he responded with ""I don't have children wines"" and never gave us an answer.  He eventually brought out the wines with no wine glasses.  We had to ask 2 times for wine glasses and 3 times for water.  We then waited a long time again to order appetizers.  He was outside on the phone for 20 minutes while we waited to order.  We ordered pruchetta bruchetta and hummus.  They were okay but nothing special.

Long after we finished our appetizers, we had to find him to tell him we needed to order dinner.  He took our order and our food came out 5 minutes later.  It was obviously reheated.  The pork roast was dry, tough, and flavorless.  The asparagus was mushy and also burnt from being overcooked.  My boyfriend ordered farfalle and they brought him a different side.  When he mentioned it wasnt what he ordered, they said they had run out of farfalle and gave him something else instead.  He asked for a different option, and they said they would try to find some farfalle.  3 minutes later, they appeared with a side of farfalle...

The lamb and chicken were both VERY thin and very dry and tasteless.

Bad food, slow and rude service, overpriced.  Definitely will NOT be returning."
EF8PHciQ68dOPhgXyxefAg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"This place is so hidden! The food was pretty good, but not for the price.  If the prices were cut in half, I would say it would be more on par for the atmosphere and food quality.  We tried the calamari and empanada to start, followed by a seafood paella, seafood pasta and cheesy chicken.  The seafood was all bland and a little chewy. The rice was good, I think if we got a paella with chorizo it would have been better."
hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"This restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center, I saw the sign but never knew what it was.  Turns out, this is the some of the best pizza in Phoenix!  We'll be back for sure!"
FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"We have driven past here many times and finally decided to try it. AMAZING! The food tastes just like my in-laws family makes. Perfect beans and rice, the red chili beef and spinach enchiliadas were on point! This will become our new go-to spot!"
5L4XcFz1YKeurNGeMR-fsQ,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,2,"The food was okay. We both ordered buffalo chicken wraps.  The wraps had blue cheese and ranch in them, which made it taste a little weird and the blue cheese was overpowering.  If we return, we will definitely try something else instead.  Our waitress had a huge attitude and neither of us knew why.  Decent prices, but cash or checks only.  (Who accepts checks anymore but not cards?)"
nsNONDHbV7Vudqh21uicqw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,2,"I was excited to go to Salt Cellar because I had heard good things... The food was good but nothing worth writing home about.  I ordered the baked stuffed lobster.  There was more of a thin, overcooked layer on top of the lobster than being stuffed... It was so thin and dry that it was hard to taste any of the seafood in the stuffing.  It is served still in the lobster, my personal preference is to be served the lobster as a filet out of it's shell.  Overall, it was rather tough, dry and flavorless.  The sides were unimpressive.  For the price, I believe there are better restaurants to go to."
M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"I have had good experiences at Mastro's City Hall, so we decided to try Mastro's Steakhouse further North.

The escargot and ahi tuna tostadas were very good.  I enjoyed my martini.  However, the lamb I ordered medium came out dry and well-done.  I sent it back and, once the other people in my party were finished eating, received new lamb that was rare.  Our waiter seemed like he was waiting on too many tables, he was very flustered and forgot about our requests.  The tables were also so wide that we were sitting too far from the person across from us, and we were shouting to be able to have a conversation."
8-_jXGGDFPFAPB4r1x-81w,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,4,"Overall, I like it.  The place is ALWAYS packed and VERY loud!  You will have to scream over all the other voices and music to hear each other.  The food was pretty good but very overpriced.  Also, they have happy hour at the bar but not at the tables next to the bar?  What sense does that make?  We just walked over to the bar to order our drinks and brought them back to the table... Not my fault theres no room at the bar.  Most of the yard games were taken and waits were formed to play them... We managed to sneak in a table at ping pong."
SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,4,"Fresh ingredients and the chicken was good quality, that's a plus in my book. Everything was prepared well and tasted great. Service was fast and friendly. We will be back!"
Iq7NqQD-sESu3vr9iEGuTA,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,I have been to Butters twice now and both of my experiences were about the same.  The service was pretty bad both times and both times they messed up my order.  I had them remake it the first time and it was pretty good.  The second time I enjoyed what they brought me even though it wasn't what i ordered.  This would be a great place with better service.
2Yq-Y-tDroP7mdDfcWJLCQ,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,Gave this place another shot and loved it!  Fish tacos and mexican hot dog were delicious!
Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"I have been here twice, once late at night and got some drinks and appetizers, another time with a big group for Sunday brunch.  It is packed for brunch on the weekends, they offer $15 bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's until 2 or 3, so everyone comes here to help cure their hangovers.  The food is just okay, don't expect anything special.  People mostly come here for the environment and the DJ."
YauBkH-HEx148jC0pv4Hcg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"We went to Richardson's for a date night. We were told they don't take reservations for parties less than 4 people. When we arrived, the wait was an hour. We chose to wait because we didn't want to sit at the bar, but after a while we were hungry so we gave in. We were constantly bumped into by anyone passing by behind us and I had some personal space issues with the drunk woman standing next to me. I enjoyed the prickly pear margarita and, with the exception of the crowded bar area, the ambiance was nice. The chorizo spinach dip and sriracha chicken skewers were great but our entrees were just okay. The food was overpriced for what it was."
HVyxN-G8NOfUHo2cEnilVw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,4,"Good place!  You pick your raw vegetables, meat and sauce and they cook it for you.  I recommend putting your vegetables in the bottom of the bowl and the meat on top so that the veggies dont fall off.  You pick what kind of starch (noodles, rice) when you give your bowl to the cook.  My only complaint is SLOW SERVICE- takes forever for refills and to get your check."
2uRM8Et0uJVl8u1jSnmuKw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,4,"I have been here a few times.  The pad thai is good here, and I would recommend the food.  The restaurant is decorated nicely and has good curb appeal.  The service has always been very slow.  The wait staff isn't quick to refill water or do anything really, and the food takes 30-45 minutes to come out (and it wasn't busy).  This isn't a good place to go if you have a limited amount of time."
1d6c6Q2j2jwVzBfX_dLHlg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"Two words: Stetson Chopped! You have to try it, I get it every time!  Extensive wine list, upscale decor that is perfect for date night or an evening out with friends, excellent service.  Everything on the menu is incredible.  The birthday cake is a different flavor everyday.  My only complaint: no chocolate dessert to indulge in after dinner.  One of my favorite places to dine!"
HO5cfgdnn13z-7sDSgrWkg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,2,"Mediocre at best... We stopped by for lunch today to try out this new restaurant.  The decor is trendy and the service was good but we were unimpressed by the food.  We both tried the carne asada tacos which were totally dry and flavorless.  The fish tacos came with one tiny piece of fish that didn't even span the length of the small (also flavorless) corn tortilla.  The pickled vegetables on the fish tacos gave it a small amount of flavor but not much.  The pork belly tacos were also dried out (noticing a theme here?).  Our lunch cost $30 for us each to have water and 3 dried out, flavorless tacos.  We will not be back with so many other good street taco restaurants in the valley.  This place probably won't last long anyway."
J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,4,"You've gotta love any place that puts margaritas on happy hour!  $6 drinks and appetizers - guacamole and tacos were what I expected.  Drinks were mixed well.  Cute, southwestern decor with a modern twist.  We will be back."
a8hu06rFnwILU4Y6sgqW_A,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"Not bad, not great... Good place to go late-night when nothing else is open.  For a good sub, I prefer Jimmy Johns for sure."
l-Cu_WkJt5R1v71ecYeqsA,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"It is worth dining here for the atmosphere and view alone.  The Wrigley Mansion is beautiful and sits on top of a hill, offering a panorama of the city.  Our waiter was knowledgable, friendly, and provided great service.  The food, however, was rather basic and bland with smaller portions.  I expected unique flavors and dishes.  I would not say the food was worth the price tag, but it was worth a visit for the view."
RsREl3LkFGiwbt3kGIX4Eg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"Best BBQ, hands down.  I go out of my way to get Honey Bear's!   Everything is SOO good.  My only complaint is that I wish they had corn bread!"
_MVSmAYSl4RkgXBg5e8JaQ,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,4,"I love this place. I don't get here as much as I'd like, but the dutch apple pancake is heavenly! Decor is a little outdated and cash only at this location..."

mygLP5-SCnQwIev6LU9gWg,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,3,"Good gyro.  For about $1 more than the gyro sandwich, get the gyro platter which comes with 2 pitas, fries AND salad and feeds two people.  Inexpensive and pretty good, the fries and gyro were greasy and the fries were covered in pepper.  There was also a lot of dressing on my salad."
nXNv6jvbj7sl50w7NL6KlQ,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,2,"Consistently bad service regardless of the time of day... I have gone both for lunch (when not busy) and happy hour... horrible.  Totally horrible service :( Not unfriendly, just total lack of enthusiasm and VERY, VERY slow......be prepared to wait!!!!"
jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"This was only my second experience with Indian food, so let me just say up front I am obviously NOT an expert on this cuisine and don't have much to compare it to.  All I have is my palette!

With that said, as far as positives go - the restaurant is located in the Scottsdale Mall, nice area and right next to the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center.  The inside is nice too.  I ordered the Chicken Masala (kept it basic and simple).  I thought it was flavorful, I liked it!  It's served with a side of rice.  They serve this cracker bread type thing (sorry, don't know what it's called) for the table when you sit down, along with these 2 sauces to dip it in. Both were delicious, full of flavor.  They had a spicy and sweet quality to them.  I also ordered one of their special cocktails, can't remember the whole name - Madarajah something.... it had bourbon, ginger and lemon.  Was very good!

Now for the negatives....we went on a Friday night, the place was almost full and there were 3, THREE servers working the entire restaurant, INCLUDING the bar.  So basically the ""bartender"" was a server who was leaving the bar unattended to take tables in the dining room. (while my friend and I sat, unacknowledged, for 15-20 minutes till we finally went back to our table and had our server just get the drinks for us). I was pretty surprised that on a Friday night there were only 3 people.  Now, they were definitely hustling and running around and working very hard (we were a large party) but in my opinion that is just completely ridiculous to be that understaffed. It creates a tense environment and you feel like you are overwhelming them if you ask for anything.  Granted, our server was very nice and clearly was running his ass off!  The food really didn't take long considering all this, I was pretty shocked.  I am not saying I wouldn't go back, but I would not go back on a weekend when it's chaotic like that.  Also, and maybe this is because I have worked in the food service/restaurant industry, but when the food runner came with our food, they were ""auctioning off"" the food.  This is a peeve of mine, I find it completely tacky and unprofessional.  Not to mention the guy doing it must NOT have understood English because he gave me the wrong dish twice before giving me my order.  LOL.  Again, it's not enough to keep me from returning, but I think they need to stop doing that!"
VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"Meh, not super impressed with this place.  Had the Kung Pao chicken.  Was just OK.  Wasn't spicy at ALL and I wanted at least a little kick!  Chicken was a weird texture.  I wasn't a fan.

I also ordered the Thai Coconut soup and that was OK.... again, not the spice I wanted.  Portions are really decent size though, and service was good.

Probably won't go back cause I just wasn't terribly impressed...."
p9UMu6H_C2kf3yi3gwyeRg,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,5,"I really love it here - great atmosphere, great place to watch the game - and the food was fantastic!! I ordered the mussels - really generous portion, cooked beautifully with a delicious buttery wine sauce and fresh herbs.  Served with a couple pieces of garlic bread on the side.  Also got the LP House Salad.  The chicken was grilled and tender and juicy, great flavor.  Served on top of salad with blue cheese and fresh tomatoes.  The portions are generous and definitely worth every penny.

Katie waited on us, she was super nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us excellent service from beginning to end.  I see a great future ahead for this place and definitely would recommend to anyone that wants a fun, laid back place to hang out with friends, have some good food and drinks and enjoy the game!"
3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg,bunscyKOgh-AfjChPUSaaA,3,"OK so mixed feelings about this place.  First off, the ambience and appearance of the restaurant is beautiful and classy but not pretentious.  THE BAR!!! wow... really pretty display of the bottles all the way up to the ceiling.  Sat at the bar first, service was great.  This place is PRICEY! I mean I knew it was higher-end, and I GLADLY will pay a high price for a great meal any day.  But $18 for a martini?? whoa... I got one martini, my date got 2 and we shared a Charcuterie platter.  Total bill was $77.

Then we sat down for dinner.  Our server was outstanding.  The service in general right across the board I felt was top notch.  Also they have a really nice wine list and the server seemed knowledgeable about the wines that weren't even on the menu which we got a bottle of.  We ordered prawns and lobster for appetizers... the lobster was ok, the prawns were HUGE wow!  No complaints there.  Served with butter, cocktail sauce, atomic horseradish and a mustard sauce.  I ordered the short rib for dinner.  Very salty and on the fatty side.  Super rich.... and it's so dark in there its hard to even see what's on your plate.  For sides we got the lobster mashed potatoes and the Brussel sprouts.  Both were meh. Nothing spectacular.

For dessert we got the crème brulee which was fantastic, we ate it all.  And a smore dessert, super sweet and rich but good.  they blow torch the marshmallow topping right at the table which I thought was a fun touch.

Overall it was bot a bad experience, I just didn't feel the food was necessarily worth the price.... but I will definitely go back and give them another try!"
len2nrEtgD9bjnoYSyLPjA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,Great mediterranean food with excellent service! I had the Jerusalem salad with Chicken Shawarma and Feta and my fiance had the Chicago gyro pita with feta and fries. We both enjoyed our meals immensely!
XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Oh True Food...I have visited you many times since your opening and you never fail to deliver on great service and yumilicious food.

I really love your Summer Salad which I had on my most recent visit...the perfect combination of ingredients..it makes my heart sing. (I hope that I can get the summer salad in the winter?) I know you like to mix things up my darling True Food...

I also had the Watermelon Rose cocktail which may be my favorite cocktail of late...

You just make me so happy True Food!! Thank you for being you and sorry I didn't review you sooner....I would never take you for granted!"
thlAnPN1ApoNxSnok_fcvA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,Great breakfast! This was my first time here. I loved my California omelette and my fiance enjoyed the chicken avocado club. Service was great! Good to know that they serve breakfast all day. We will be back!
roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,I love Tutti Santi on 16th St! The service is always top-notch. The setting is authentic Italian. It is the one place in town where I can get orange roughy-my favorite fish. It is prepared in the most divine lemon/caper sauce with artichoke hearts-truly spectacular. I love the flaming Sambuca at the end of the meal.
wJY74R0zAgjxvBf-d4gm9g,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Wound up at Kelly's last night. Our server Sierra was fantastic and a total sweetheart. Even though the bar became pretty packed (Spring Training), the service was consistently great the whole time.We had the Haloumi cheese stuffed cherry peppers as well as Ahi tuna cups. Both appetizers were delicious.Cocktails were really good and we also sampled some Jameson whiskey and ginger ale from the Jameson girls. It was overall a younger crowd last night but there was enough of a mix that it made for great people watching."
_DPJ_PHJnXsuhYhsgBA0Xw,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Oh yes, Durant's!

We have been coming to Durant's for dinner the last 4 or 5 years. Usually when we dine there it is on a Saturday night and it is usually fairly busy. I can honestly say not only have I had fantastic meals here, but, the service is always spot on. The decor is old school which I love. You really feel like you stepped back in time with the red booths and traditionally dressed waiters. I love walking through the kitchen to get to the maitre d. It is one of the few places in town where I love dressing up to dine out, as the atmosphere is totally conducive to that. (No worries if you want to go casual -it is my own personal preference when I dine at Durant's-something about the atmosphere makes me want to wear a dress.) :)

I love their shrimp cocktail. It is fantastic. I am not even a steak eater anymore-I realize that is what they are known for but I love Durant's none-the-less. Their fish dishes are really good.

I love their crudites when you are seated-there is something magical about their ranch dressing.

I need to mention the bussers. I drink A LOT of water. Those guys and gals hustle-they are top notch. My water glass is never empty long and I appreciate that.

Nice wine list, and their wines are reasonably priced."
_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,4,"4 1/2 stars actually...

I really enjoyed Rokerij. Our server David was fantastic, and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner, the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.

Rokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my ""vodka surprise"" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)

I ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.

I would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar, we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!"
tTR9GQbdC-rEHNsECmSWRw,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,We ate out on the patio last night. The weather was gorgeous the band was terrific and the food was delicious. In my previous review I forgot to mention their margaritas. They are my favorite margs in town. They are expensive but I love the fresh lime juice. I had the special which was grouper fish with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was very flavorful and nicely prepared. My friend ordered seafood tacos.
sWwCwjsd27k0Y8m1RIWZEg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"I love the view, food and service here. I love dinner and brunch at El Chorro. I just adore everything about this restaurant. (No, the sticky buns are not a draw for me :) I personally think they are weird with wine and dinner-I guess I am not a sticky buns kind of girl) Love the patio!This is one of my favorite places in the valley."
oSI3qAZI_zhd91twB-ivqA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"I have eaten at Tutti Santi on 16th street and am a fan. We were on the west side of town and decided to try this location. The menu is slightly different, however the food was equally as delicious and the service was really great. My dining companion had a salmon/mushroom/asparagus spaghetti and I had orange roughy in the divine lemon caper sauce-triple yum. Both meals were outstanding."
zbrFk-4ejesAJD8EwcdHxg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"I could probably get my elite status revoked for saying this...but it dawned on me that as much as I've eaten here over the years I have never reviewed Valle Luna. Valle Luna is one of those places you just kind of take for granted. Like a sweet guy who maybe isn't exactly your type and is in the friend zone and  is always around until he disappears and then you are like ""Where'd you go?"". My analogy isn't the best,,,but I know what I mean!

So it always makes me smile when people ""tell"" me about Valle Luna. ""There's this good little Mexican place on Cave Creek""....""Oh...Valle Luna?""....""Yes!""

Valle Luna is a place where I have had many a happy hour and super casual dinner. I prefer the cantina as I feel the service is slightly better in there...(not that I have had poor service in the restaurant it is just ""happier"" in the cantina.) Like my daughter told me just last night when I pointed out I like the cantina better...She said, ""Yeah...the restaurant is for old people"". I replied with ""Yeah, and we are NOT old"", which is funny because...well...I am actually old and was appreciative that my daughter didn't point that out like she normally does.

I love their seafood taco dinner with cod as well as their steak tacos. I also love that you can substitute calabicitas for the rice/beans. That gives Valle Luna a star right there. They have a really good Happy Hour menu too.So if someone mentions a Mexican place they want to go to on Cave Creek-by all means check it out!"
7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"I was craving some red meat. Not just red meat...a juicy burger. Fortunately in my neighborhood there is this yumtastic burger joint. I previewed the menu online and theoretically could have called in my order since I was taking it to go but wanted to check it out a bit longer. I had the Beach house burger (roasted green chili, smoked mozarella, and pico de gallo) and a side of carnival corn.Well, I was pretty hungry so I actually took some nibbles of my corn on the car ride home-very tasty. It was seasoned splendidly and was delicious. My burger was great. I LOVED the grilled green chili. It was extremely tasty with just the right amount of spice. I guess I am used to green chilis being kind of soggy but this was darn near perfect and very fresh. The burger is served on a brioche bun (which I didn't eat because that is how I roll with burgers..I don't eat the bread..could have ordered it protein style with lettuce but I forgot..the bun looked tasty though!  :)
In addition to burgers they have sandwiches, tacos/taco salads, and some interesting sides. I definitely would like to try the sweet potato tots and a taco salad on my next visit. Next time my meat craving kicks in..I know just the place."
llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,2,"I used to like this place but unfortunately India Palace has slowly gone down hill. Waaaay down hill. Plus as I  learned, they have zero loyalty to their customers who eat there fairly regularly. Last night was the last straw. In fact my meal was like chewing straw and inedible. I ordered the Bhindi Masala which is a vegetable okra dish. I have had this several times before but tonight the okra was so tough that if I were to actually swallow it (rather than spit it out in my napkin-sorry gross but true) I guarantee my throat would have been scratched. Also our Roti bread was burned.Not once did anyone check to see how our meals were. When the waitress offered me a box for the uneaten meal at the end , I declined and explained the situation: I have had this dish before but it was like chewing wood shavings (explained it nicer than that) and she just said ok and brought us the bill with no offer to either replace it with another item or take it off the bill like 99.9% of establishments would do. So, they have lost our business and managed  to tick off a yelper over a VERY simple customer service issue."
zJGtD3y-pAIGNId4codEEg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,3,"Food-wise this restaurant is easily 5 stars.I have been here 3 times now and have had different menu items each time and everything has been fresh, delicious, and creative.I have nothing but glowing things to say about the cuisine! Their drink menu is pretty awesome too.

The space and concept are fabulous as well....

I want so badly to be able to call this my favorite restaurant and come back frequently but I have to say the service each time has been extremely ""awkward"" and it took asking the server 3 times on our last visit just to get water and 2 times to make sure our guacamole order was in. Previous visits were just as frustrating-including the time we ate at the bar. In fact, we had guacamole technical difficulties on a prior visit as well..

I get that it is a loud restaurant but servers should be able to work around that and make sure they clarify orders. I have honestly never seen such a confused staff.

It is frustrating because I feel like this restaurant is on the cusp of being something fantastic but they haven't quite pulled it together. I mean any other place I would not have returned after the sloppy service but the location, premise and food are that good!

Ok Otro...I am going to give you one more try. OK...maybe 2 more tries...The burning question remains...is the end result (the food) worth the hassle/frustration of getting to the amazing food? That remains to be seen..."
tGLz8WfLwSi221wgNh-0qw,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"As a vegetarian, I will tell you that this place is one of my favorites! I am in love with both their Massage Salad and their Kaleidoscope Salad..both of these have kale as a base..they also have 'heartier"" fare for my non-vegan/vegetarian boyfriend such as sandwiches and wraps My boyfriend loves the Basil Pesto Focaccia. Unfortunately, the cafe is only open for lunch but I am holding out hope that they eventually extend their hours.."
RPO5ISR18Xllgk9ahdPepA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,I can't believe I have never reviewed Tarbells! This is one of my favorites as the food/service is consistently awesome. Jillian (not sure if she works there anymore) is the best server! This establishment has it goin on!
Bkkwt8E9MHvgCHn4lUFtow,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,We love Roys. The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful.The ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a Saturday.  My water glass is constantly being refilled because the people Roy's employ are totally on the ball. We have dined here 8+ times over the past 2 years and have never had a mediocre meal. They also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server. The wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktails.We have dined here on both special occasions and regular Saturday nights. It is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous JW Marriott. ...definitely in my top three Phoenix area restaurants.
J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,Have been back a few times since this post and this restaurant is still one of my faves...I got to experience their brunch menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago...and...wow! My veggie omelette was delicious as was my boyfriend's meal-the breakfast enchiladas..we split a glass of wine because I believe brunch isn't brunch without a little alchohol and it was a generous pour/split...keep doin' yo thing Sierra Bonita!
rW5N-fiNhqb-fR3bGqyPdg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,4,I do like Rosie's and thank god they got some decent bartenders in there on Saturday night now. The two beeyotches who worked there forever and never cracked a smile needed to go! Much better! The waitresses are always sweet. Some great bands (like RIG) play at Rosie's. The crowd is usually pretty friendly....it is everything you would expect from a neighborhood Irish pub...
HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,4,"Ok-It pains me to have to take away a star. Dined here on Saturday. The service was really awkward and everything was a little off including the food which my dining companion noted did not ""wow"" him this time. I had to agree that mine was not quite as tasty as usual. I would have loved a second cocktail but our server disappeared so by that time our dinner was well over so we just decided to go somewhere else for that second drink. There were also two couples waiting for a table that just kind of loitered in our vicinity. It was strange being stared down for a table at Fuego. I am not willing to write Fuego off yet as I loved it so. I am really hoping it was just an ""off"" night. I don't think I can persuade my dinner date to go back there anytime soon but it is still on my list of faves."
OfITr0B8bZU3vukSQJIrWQ,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Yes! Talk about a flavor explosion in your mouth. Everything was extremely delicious. A+ on their guacamole. I had the salmon tacos and holy cow! They were quite delicious. My dinner date had the Al Pastor (roasted pork) tacos and he said and I quote ""This place rocks!"". Their skinny margarita was tasty and gets a thumbs up.

I must mention their bathrooms which were very clean and unisex. There is a row of bathrooms across from a row of sinks so it is quite possible you could be washing hands next to a dude. It was not very primping friendly. I wasn't about to start curling my eyelashes or applying lipstick when a strange boy could walk in..somehow that seemed a little awkward to me. It was just pee/wash hands/ and exit ASAP!

Anyway if you are looking for a creative Mexican fusion place with a great atmosphere-try Milagro Grill!"
eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,2,"Our car's driver side window was smashed as we sadly observed when we finally made our way out of this restaurant (hours later)on this less than stellar evening..we spent yet more time cleaning glass off of the seats just to FINALLY get to drive away from the Ghetto cafe..er Barrio cafe...but I digress..

I don't know.... I guess a place that consistently has between an hour and 2 hour wait on a Saturday and doesn't take reservations has got to be beyond fabulous and worth waiting for right? You think? Wow..I am actually embarrased I fell for this. This must be what the people who bought Charlie Sheen tickets felt like...  Sucker! That is what I felt like last night for sure. First off, we had swung by here a couple of different Saturdays but (smartly) decided the wait wasn't worth it...my bf really wanted to try it ( be careful what you wish for)..so we got there (early for us) around 6:45 pm last night to put our name down and do the CRAZY hour and 30 minute waiting game...did I mention the bar area and patio are tiny and you get the added experience of being packed in like cows in an unorganic dairy farm....

Ok..so the food portion of the review...two words...mediocre and overrated...the guacamole was salty...i didn't get to see it prepared tableside because the restaurant was so crowded and small the server (who gets 4 personal stars because she was sweet)...literally couldn't fit the preparation cart anywhere near our table...our main dishes...were just ok.....nothing tasted particulary fantastic and the dining room felt hot with no air circulation...thank goodness for the wine....

This is probably one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to...I was thinking no way will I be returning..that idea was more than cemented when we saw the glass damage...wtf? Maybe if you took reservations Barrio.. and had a decent parking situation..people wouldn't be sans their car for 3 hours just to eat dinner in the hood."
XPDzKfrq5uzz4o82eCZI7w,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Add locally grown fresh ingredients with vegetarian options add a dash of creative flair with an awesome wine selection and what do you get? A restaurant worth returning to.

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our dinners immensely. We both chose salads to start the meal. It was difficult to make a selection because all of the salad choices had interesting components. My dining companion settled on the Summer Butternut Squash salad-triple yum. I chose the Watermelon salad which was outstanding. This colorful salad had watermelon, avocado, olives, greens and they listed feta as the cheese but it tasted like blue cheese (which was fine with me..)

For our entrees, I chose the Roasted Vegetable plate. I have had a variation of this at other restaurants but this was hands-down the most delicious and colorful of veggie plates.  I also ordered a side of sauteed shishito peppers for some extra spice! My bf ordered the quail which was excellent.

The decor as others have mentioned is cowboy/AZ and it isn't a ''romantic"" restaurant  per se but nonetheless it works as the focal point is the food and we will definitely be back!"
urkODQ1jX0qQzgbqsQjWVQ,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Yippee! I was so looking forward to trying Flower Child especially after seeing their menu online. As I mentioned in previous reviews I am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I feel like Sam Fox is like Midas and again he has turned a dining establishment into gold.

My friend and I ate lunch there today. Flower Child is a fast casual concept where you place your order and then they bring you your food.

I ordered the Asian Avocado salad and a side of sweet corn w/ quinoa. Everything was absolutely delicious. I pretty much devoured the whole meal. I let my friend do most of the talking while we were eating because I was enjoying the food so much! My brain was in total food reward mode.

Oh...did I mention that they have gluten free baked goods? I had a gluten free bittersweet brownie and I'm pretty sure it revolutionized my entire life. I'm pretty sure if the brownie were a man, we would be walking down the aisle."
-F5mm0-YeCI7viSiOwVAAw,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"I was overjoyed to find this place.I was stuck in a day long training and was looking for something to eat during my lunch break. Sweet! This place is so friendly and has such  nice vibe. The people who work here, (the owners?) were so nice and they seemed to have a lot of ""regulars"" from what I observed. I don't eat bagels very often, but, I was in definite need of some comfort food after a long morning and the anticipation  of a long afternoon. I ordered an egg and cheddar cheese bagel sandwich on a sesame bagel (I was jazzed I could get the breakfast sandwich at lunchtime) with a garden salad to go. When I got into my car I took a bite of my bagel sandwich........yum!! It was perfect and the best part of my day!
I will be back!"
csy-xJWM68SXabizUIhucA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"I like this place. We sat at the bar and had fantastic service from Bobby. One (of many things) that Fox does right is they hire/train their staff and the service is always terrific  I always enjoy watching how everyone pitches in and all of the employees' outstanding attention to detail. I think other restaurants should take note, food tastes better when you are well taken care of...seriously!

I had a sour cherry paloma cocktail (a tequila based drink)  and I have to say it is probably my favorite drink in town now. Very yummy!It was served (as was my friend's beer) in a cute mason jar. The one caveat was that it was an $11.00 drink, (but easy to justify since I get a lot of Fox gift cards as gifts and used one Saturday night.) :) Yay!

My friend and I decided to share shrimp cocktail which I felt was a generous portion and the sauce had the right amount of kick. We also shared the king crab with butter in jar w/ grilled bread...yum...very succulent (not a word I use a lot...but my brain kept thinking it while I was eating...so i will go with it)...:) We also ordered some garlic fries with aioli saude..(oink..oink) They were thick cut wedges-pretty good but I probably wouldn't order them again.( I will save my french fry quota for the year for El Charro and their to-die-for truffle fries..)

I did not partake in their oysters which is their specialty but have made a commitment that that will be the route I take next time I am there.

The restaurant is located in the midst of the Yard and Culinary dropout and the Yard bar was hopping on Saturday night. Little Cleo's itself is quite small and very modern with an open kitchen and the back wall of restaurant opposite the  bar is all windows so you can people watch if you are so inclined."
CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Hana's is great! Everything is always fresh and delicious. It is a small establishment with friendly service. You can BYOB which is fun. I have had everything from sushi, sashimi, rolls, tempura or one of their dinner entrees and everything is absolutely delicious. I like the super casual vibe. I am just not into the foofoo sushi bars. I eat there often so shame on me for not reviewing them sooner!"
QlJztL2aGEXgejgi5JM9Xg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"Four of us came here Saturday late afternoon to enjoy the downstairs patio and the steel drums. We had a great time and the weather was fantastic. Our server, Ben, took great care of us. This was my second time visiting Tommy Bahamas. On a previous visit I had a cocktail (Grapefruit basil which was fantastic!) and dinner upstairs which is also a very cool bar and the dinner was great. A lot of seafood dishes on their menu which I LOVE.

Dining upstairs is a totally different experience than downstairs and I highly recommend trying both! It is fun to mix it up!

On this particular visit I was in a vodka mood so I just stuck with vodka/cranberry with lots of lime.(so much for mixing it up-ha) :) Our table decided to do appetizers and dessert as opposed to a full dinner which was perfect. We had a couple of orders of the Ahi poke which was wonderful, the pork quesadillas, (not my fave..the sauce was sticky/syrupy), and the lollipop jerk chicken which had an awesome kick and was super delicious. It was definitely super spicy but in a flavorful non obnoxious way.

Ok now to review my favorite dessert maybe EVER! I tried the pineapple creme brulee..I am a total creme brulee girl...not as much a pineapple girl but it just looked really cool and sounded good. I was not disappointed. The creme brulee was creamy deliciousness and the pineapple was light and not overpowering at all...so yeah!

I love a nice patio as it always makes me feel like I am on vacation and Tommy Bahama's patio fit the bill."
pTZ4u-sEQr-yHq2Cl4EMEw,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,3,"I just thought T Cooks was ok food wise/ambience wise. Nothing to get foodgasmic about. As far as patios/food go I would much rather dine at El Choro which I love.  I am not in a rush to eat at T Cooks again, however, my fiance did propose to me after dinner in February at Royal Palms after eating at T Cooks. We were walking the grounds and found a ""private patio"" and the bf popped the question. in the middle of the proposal a server came out and asked if we were part of the wedding party...I am not a good liar so I said no, so we nicely got booted...dude you are interrupting a moment here..anyway we continued with part 2 of the proposal somewhere else on the resort grounds..:)"
97w3hi6ngScJquXakwTWuA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,2,"I will make this short. I love sushi and this was the worst, most flavorless sushi I have ever had. I guess I have been spoiled by Hana's Japanese Eatery and the freshness and quality there. I did enjoy the cocktail which was called the Ahsosuki."
WBt2pa7k_K2LKW2OJuXG9Q,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"This is such a great place to come for lunch or breakfast especially when it is ""patio weather"". I had a great time here with my friend yesterday. We came around lunch time and were seated right away. We got a great table in the shade.The weather couldn't have been more ideal. Thank god fall is here! I understand that the restaurant gets extremely busy during the weekend.The restaurant itself is very pretty and the service was fantastic.

I went with a friend who loves to eat (but you wouldn't know it by looking at her)...(I know...if she weren't so great I might have to hate on her! Just kidding!)We decided to split a couple of appetizers and an entree. We had the crab tower with avocado-pretty fantastic, the brie cheese plate, and we split a shrimp pesto salad. Everything was very delightful! We also split a chocolate toffee cookie at the very end. We were at the restaurant for a couple of hours as we had a lot of catching up to do.

This is a beautiful venue and they have private rooms and we also found out that the owners house which is right next door is available for events. The yard/courtyard was very beautiful and lush.

All in all a fantastic lunch and I hope to go there for brunch in the near future,"
rMCKv9puuu2NkYISHnwyWg,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,5,"I agree with a prevous poster who says this Rubios is the best in the area. The employees are super friendly and nice. Between my kids and myself, we usually make tons of modifications:( hold this, add that etc.)...I always order the chipotle ranch chicken salad (minus chicken and cheese w/ dressing on the side)..they always take my order without batting an eyelash and ALWAYS get it right..my salad is always crisp and fresh and we probably take out from Rubios 3 times a month..."

Because Flo's is close by I often have parents who treat me to Flo's. They have a really great lunch portion menu and their lunches come with a side salad and the crispy wonton chips. My (new) favorite dish is the Pine Nut Shrimp-absolutely delicious-one of my student's parents brought me this dish last week to celebrate the end of AIMS testing. I don't even mind that  the mere thought of salt makes me blow up like a puffer fish (let's face it-you can't really get away from sodium when it comes to Chinese food). The pine-nut shrimp and Flo's food in general is totally worth it!"
50NTSGbZ3pN5643_K1IReA,tScgzC_Zt3-5rViXNLWacQ,4,This is one of our go-to Mexican places. They have a surprisingly extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian options and of course the classics. Their chips and salsa are muy delicioso and their margaritas are yummy. The servers are always consistently great. The only thing I don't like is their guacamole...it's creamy almost like a dip and not my guac style.
voZnDQs6Hs3YpNcS-9TALg,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,4,"Dined here for the first time on 5-26 with my wife & daughter. My mother-in-law said we should try it and we are glad we did. I ordered a Bean Tostada and a Ground Beef Taco. The taco first. It was Crispy, Crunchy and lots of flavor, loaded up right. Only negative was it fell apart as soon as you took your first bite. No worries though, nothing a fork couldn't handle.. Now on to the Bean Tostada. One of the best I have had in years. It was a thinish shell, yet supportive enough for the all the goodies on top. The beans are way flavorful as well. We also ordered a Fry Bread sans the Honey.. WHOA Nelly. NOT your ordinary Fry bread. Most fry bread is a greasy lump. However here that is not the case. Light, Fluffy and just the right amount of Powered Sugar on top.

I will be back as well. A hidden gem, without signage (which is 100% ok with me), so the ""hipsters, wannabees, and doofus'"" stay away and don't ruin this place, like they do with most places in Gilbert/Chandler."

Oddly, once I told one we needed a few minutes to order another one popped up asking if we were ready to order.....ODD !

Hot tea is very basic !

Ordered the rainbow tofu dish ( mixed veggies with tofu and mushrooms ), singapore chow fun and some seafood dish my mom got. I ordered a veggie singapore with no egg and what comes out...eggs all scrambled with in it. I was disappointed because I stressed it to the several waitress' we had.

Once our food came, they all strarted to mop all around us....a weird pet peave of mine. Restaurant wasnt closing for at least another hour but felt so impelled to start cleaning as soon as our food came out ! Grrrrr

Plenty of seating, alcohol license, big family tables with the lazy suzy in the middle ( I loves those tables ), and typical asian decor."

This place can cater to both vegetarians and the meat eaters in your family. The price includes, your creation ( noodle stir fry or just a veggie stir fry ), white or brown rice, 2 types of soups ( both have meat in it though ), crispy noodles, a drink and frozen yogurt (dinner time only ). There is a choice between a kiddies (for ages up to 12 I think ), a small bowl, large bowl and an all you can eat bowl. I always pick the small bowl and fill it up like crazy. It costs about 11 bucks but can easily give me 2-3 meals out of it and its so worth the money, as long as you pay $.50 for the to go container.

I always pack mine with lots of veggies, tofu and noodles. This place has a sauce suggestions and its pretty accurate and tasty but I always go for the spicy peanut thai sauce !"
0pazeZax1Nt9cn0U_8aSUQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,2,"I LOVE thai food but I have tried this place at least 3 different times and it has falken short EVERY time.
Food is mediocre and the only positive side is that they have cheap lunch specials, I believe $6.95 - that includes entree, veggie soup and veggie eggroll. However I dont mind paying money for some tasty food but I guess if you are on a budget and like mediocre thai food or dont know any better this is the place for you !
The lady who is a waitress is hell-a rude and ignores her customers. Walks away while you are talking to her, waves her hand says ok and doesn't bring out what you had tried to ask for. The previous visit she completey screwed up our order and begged for us to still eat it and pay for it because she would get in trouble with boss....we wouldn't have minded if it was something we ate but it was shrimp and we both are vegetarians, we even told her before we order (no fish sauce, we are vegetarians and dont eat meat or seafood ) ummmm NO THANK YOU !! The most recent  visit we did get lunch specials and I didn't realize it came with an eggroll and soup until we saw the waitress bring it out for another table who just got there , I asked her but this time we already were eating our entress. She brought it out anyways and I figured better late than never, right ? When we were getting up I heard that same waitress arguing with another customer since she tried to convince him that is what he ordered aftet she brought the wrong item to him....I actually cant believe she is still there !!!"

The lights went out after taking a few bites, I guess Dana Park looses power often, we got to go containers since I didn't want to eat my food in the dark. Luckiky the 40 minute drive home had time to marinate the flavors of my kale and quinoa salad together. When I got home I enjoyed what was left.

Kuddos to the complimentary half chocolate covered strawberry.....it was tasty.

Didnt care for the hard bread roll that was complimentary too with the soup....it was hard and tasted ""industrialized"".
Son enjoyed the lobster and red pepper bisque though very much along with his meatless cobb salad....

Not sure why people compare Jasons Deli and Wildflower to this since both of them have organic options and Zupas unfortunately does NOT. Even though the food options are better here than fast food joints, it still felt very fast foodish to me !"

I got an iced herbal tea that didnt taste good at all, so bitter I couldn't drink it , my son got one of their frozen fruit drinks that was severly fake and sugared filled, he didnt even like it nor finush it either and mom got a plain coffee....no one was happy here and probably wont go back BUT the idea is cool and if you are a lover of donuts you probably should check it out and see for yourself!

Hubby loves the thai chilli fish (he always gets this)
Thai tea with coconut cream instead of the dairy ( so yum )
Sticky rice and mango
Truthfully though, a thai hot is never a thai hot here but food is pretty good so ensure you order extra thai hot if you like spicy but if not you will be just as good !!!
Location is very small but we never had to wait more than 10 minutes to sit and eat even on a busy weekend night !"
U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Veggie spring rolls, vegetable pho, any noodle, stir fry and rice can be made vegetarian here with tofu and lots of veggies. But this is one of my go to places for vegetable pho and Vietnamese vegetarian spring rolls in Chandler!!

This place sometimes gets packed but they are pretty quick about getting people in, served and out !"
uDFtCeOLpaJc24eK70r0Eg,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,3,"I love fresh juices and smoothies, even better if it was organic, but this place isnt organic. They make smoothies only (no juices) and some food. They claim that all their fruits and veggies are fresh except for the peaches , I guess they use canned peaches :/  They have one size and the smoothies are $4.99. I guess they put sugar in all their smoothies except for a green one and another on. I ordered the green one, it was pretty tasty. However the girls working their seemed bothered by my questions that I asked tonight because I have never been there before and wanted to ensure I was getting a no dairy and no added sugar drink. They were a bit rude too, someone probably should talk to them about customer service."
lC2hnEYBN_97HXDQnpGpZA,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"They have vegan donuts here ( not everything is vegan, but you have to ask ) and they are sooooooo good, very tasty and not dry at all ! The Wild Rabbit makes their vegan donuts and even though they are $4.00 a piece, they are sooo delicious!"
Jhz-8IqPf_2YUWsbGFyDNA,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"Love this place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks           or coffee/tea.  They have it all! I have tried most of their menu and my favorite vegan dishes are breakfast pizza or burrito and bruschetta board. Even though this is vegetarian restaurant, some of the dishes can be made with dairy, please specify if you are a vegan to ensure they dont make the mistake and put cheese your pizza.
Great selections of teas ,smoothies and freash juices....pure love! They also have some pretty tasty baked goodies !!!"
OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Local coffee house that also has teas (free refills on teas ), large selection of drinks, food menu, pastries (they even have vegan pastries that are tasty ) , free wifi, plenty of seating , open early to the midnight hour & music has got to be my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix!!
Its busy here but they have a pretty quick system here .."
Q0EZmATxDphzRMszNV2LVg,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Most of the breads here are vegan but high gluten, none are gluten free though. They offer 1 soup that is vegan and a couple that are vegetarian. The veggie soup that was vegan was pretty tasty, had more flavor and depth to it than cafeteria or canned soup. They even have bread bowls here!!
The salads and veggie sandwiches are pretty good too. I like this place over similar bakery restaurants due to them having more options.
They offer breakfast in the mornings and open for lunch and dinner for their soups, sandwiches, salads and pastas (oh and desserts ). They also have fresh loaves of breads they bake that you can buy and take home."
puQ2WGO0L2KvKqNQCJYZRw,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"This place is good, all VEGAN, every dish I ever had was really delicious, my go to items are saigon rolls ( how in the heck did they get those things to look like shrimp, its voodoo magic I tell ya ), golden vermicelli , harmony veggie soup and golden beauty! They even infuse water with different yummy fruits !!!

Place is small, but we have always seated...just dont plan on a larger party than 4.

The vegan cakes in the fridge are sooo good too.....the staff is also super friendly! Everytime I am in the area I make it a habit to stop. Be aware though, they close from 3 to 5 I think.....its odd but they do !"
0HgLKI1T9WT3hJXskDtUrQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"They have vegan milk powders here !!!! However I only ordered a jasmine tea, so yummy !! Son ordere a chocolate milk tea with brown sugar boba...pretty tasty as well.
Staff were all helpful and friendly my only complaint is the parking. Same plaza as restaurants, bars and the comedy club so even though it was free, it was a pain !"
5euk5_UKqnAWcrbOPNYt0g,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,3,"Papaya salad was NOT good at all. Dont waste your time. However the panang curry with vegetables, drunken noodles tofu with vegetables and the vegetarian pad thai were pretty tasty and what we ordered for the night.
Panang had a nice balance between the curry, coconut and peantuts. It was not soupy but pretty thick. Just enough heat. The drunken noodles had a good flavor and they fry their tofu before they put it in the meals. Fresh vegetables including peppers, broccoli, cabbage and carrots....very generous with the amount of veggies and sprouts. A 4 was plenty of heat ranging from a 1-5 with 5 being thai hot....

We even got a scoop coconut ice cream at the end of our meal....

Restaurant had plenty of booths and tables, not crowded at all and weight time was minimal!!!

Not the best, but definitely not the worst either."
oFHvr1cAktvU-bQgrl4aPw,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"Another wonderful vegan restaurant in AZ ! Great food ! Excellent coffee ! Yummy pastries ! What more can one ask for ?
There is outdoor and indoor seating. You order at the bar, pay, take a number and have a seat. They bring your order out to you hot, fresh and pretty quickly!
Staff are pretty cool, friendly and laid back here.
The almond milk latte and breakfast sandwich was so delicious, I cant wait to come back !!
Beware though parking kind of sucks though...."
Fv3HvJPQYqfmniTgtIQJzA,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"Love this coffee shop, love the area, love the location, love the vibe and love that they have vegan options for food here !!!
My go to items are the iced teas, Americano and the cubano ( but be aware its like liquid crack, holymoly !!!)
My son loves the mansoons here too !!!"
Zj4092--r1Z8izd3Uq8lKg,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,1,"Aghhh, why the high reviews?  Are they friends of the owners ? Do they not know quality Mediterranean food ? I dont get it !!  However I love their floor ! Thats the best part of the restaurant.....
We went yesterday for lunch since we were stuck on the highway in some bumper to bumber traffic and we decided to get off and get something to eat !
It was a regrettable experience....FIRST ~You stand in line and look at the menu above peoples heads that are sitting down just underneath it (VERY ODD and UNCOMFORTABLE) . So you order at the counter,they give you a number and you find a table. You grab your table and sit and wait, and wait and wait some more as you listen to one of the employees yell at probably her step children (she is either Greek or Caucasian and the poor girls were African American , she appeared to be the evil stop mom or foster mom who made these 2 young girls (probably pre teens) clear off the tables and sweep while she talked to a friend who came in and yelled at them for everything ( encouragment when they made a mistake or gratitude after asking them to do anything~ stupid bi$!&, if I wasnt a changed person she would have definitely remembered me). I cant stand people who treat children as little slaves.
Anyways the food probably took over an hour to come to our table, everyone around us was complaining and I even heard one of the guys who worked there tell a customer sorry, you ordered grill food and it usually takes 30 minutes to make AND we are already behind 30 minutes.....now at this point if we hadnt paid by now, we would have walked out but unfortunately we did so we had to wait.....AND we gave a tip at the very beginning....I hate this option!
Food finally comes and it was awful, the worse falafel balls I ever had . Hummus was very bland and they wanted to try and tell me that their salad dressing was vegan but it was white....when asked what it was made out of they said its Italian and balsamic mix.....ummm no....its not supposed to be white and creamy....even though they insisted they couldn't tell me what was exactly in it or bring me the ingredient list.
The only salvagable thing were there crispy fries.
With the quality of food not sure how they will remain open....
Just an awful experience overall....."
Ak08F6RqjHYmVCzweBbTrQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,3,"Thai is my favorite food....this was my first restaurant in Phoenix when we moved here 5 years ago and I feel the quality of food had gone down and is no longer very consistent.
We order veggie spring rolls, papaya salad, veggie pad thai and 24 k ( curry with eggplant ) along with 2 teas jasmine and white ambrosia teas (so yummy ).
Slow customer service....we waited forever to get an extra white rice, almost done with our meal by the time it came out and also waiting for our check. Dont plan on coming here if you are short on time !"
5DDumAHRKumv3gZiPKW6iw,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"Best vegan desserts in Arizona . PERIOD !!! From their soy based frozen concoctions called tsoynamis to their vegan pastries, breakfast and coffees!

They make vanilla, chocolate or a swirl of both. My go to ones are chunkey monkey and peanut butter and banana. But wanted to try something different so tonight we tried the pumpkin pie tsoynami and hubby got the banana cream pie tsoynami ( he always get that one but I would prefer it with peanut butter and chocolate) and OMG the pumpkin pie tsoynami is AMAZING..... The pumpkin puree is so good , you can actually taste it....it definitely isnt covered up by all the spices.....just pure pumpkin with vanilla and Graham crackers. YUM.....

Again friendly staff, small seating area but always fortunate to find seating every single time we are here (thank you universe). They too have outdoor seating but their parking can be a bit of a pain.

Go get dinner before hand next door and come here for dessert! You will not regret it....after all peace begins on our plate !"
XURVF3UPIfuMbckfcu5Ztg,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,3,"Mediocre flavors of basic american thai. I love spicy foods, always get thai hot in thai restaurants but thai hot here is just SUPER HEAT with NO other flavor. Ordered the tofu rad nar last night and I couldnt tell if I was eating a piece of tofu or a piece of broccoli. Was very disappointed....

Husband got the garlic eggplant with veggies in a medium and that was very delicious....next time probably stick with with a hot or a medium.

Child was happy with his pad thai !! Thats his go to meal at every thai restaurant.

Also ordered the veggie rolls and tofu spring rolls....both were fresh and satisfying !!

Also had there panang curry last time but honestly dont remember it.... :(

Not authentic enough, therefore the 3 stars.

Nice staff though and clean establishment with vegetarian oprions is a big plus."
W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"They have Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai food all infused into one menu ....the best part is that there are several vegetarian and vegan options here ! My go to dishes are the veggie rolls, veggie soup, eggplant with kung pao, orange tofu, mixed veggies and veggie chow fun. So delicious and the owners are so sweet, no matter how many times we come here she always comes out to ask if everything is ok."
MDoI5wE1eCLEZUNL-IVerg,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"I love pizza and being a vegan it has been challenging, but thanks to this place they have a wonderful pizza called the veganizza. Daiya cheese with sauce and spinach, tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil makes this one of my favorite places to go to for pizza. The salads are pretty good too. I really enjoy this place.

They have buy one get one free (pizza)on Mondays and Tuesday and Wednesdays kids eat free !

Staff is very friendly too !!!"
drYgdLcfKwFvB-EMiAVV5w,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Great food. Vegetarian and vegan options, you just have to ask, the servers are pretty knowledgeable with their non vegan items!
Delicious hummus' , pitas, veggie salads, quinoa-kale plare, micro platter, falafels, chipotle black bean burger (with no bun since its not vegan ) & the potatos all vegan and delicious....and OMG, their salad dressings that are made in house are to die for !
I always take my out of town veg head family members here and they love it as well and always ask to go back.
Teas are delicious too.
Friendly staff and fast....
Cool little hipster vibe...."
nChi_8Gygb6NUMa_kg_tlQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,2,"They do NOT have many vegan or vegetarian options here so I had to customize my order. When I asked if I can order vegetables and noodles since nothing on the menu was vegetarian she said we only have cabbage and onions for vegetables. Not going to lie, I was mad that my carnivore husband picked here to eat but he figured every Asian place has vegetarian options but clearly nothing on the menu. So after several times of the waitress going back and fourth to see what the cook can do I order and ended up getting noodles, fried tofu and veggies. I was surprised when it came out because there were more veggies than expected but the tofu was gross ( silken cubed oily tofu ), noodles and sauce were bland and oily and veggies were covered in the oily bland sauce so I was not that happy with this place ! I probably will not be back here again."
FYa3GUro-ezTM9zvKiocFw,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"Visited tonight...We ordered take out it felt very authentic.  We got the falafel pita, salad, chicken kabob pita, spinakapita, & dolmades. The falafels were ah-mazing....the best I ever had in AZ maybe even ever!! From NY, so a bit of a food snob! Salad was fresh and light!!! The spinakapita was also fabulous...(yum yum yum,is what my brain kept saying as I slowly ate them)....wish they would make this on a larger portion as an entree not just an appetizer! Daughter had the chicken and she really enjoyed it as well! I also tried the dolmades and they were good, not the best but OK. The guy who took our order was super friendly, actually all of them were. Good vibe!!!

We didn't order the gyro but noticed they thinly shave the meat off the spit too.

Great place and when I am out here in the area, I will definitely be back!!!"
FbMZ0N5iAicep5ssYLZB9w,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Actually I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We were on the way to the swap meet but we were hungry so we stopped here first. The fried orange tofu was pretty good and when I asked if they can add broccoli to it, they did and without a charge ! Staff were nice as well and it was pretty busy here on the weekend. You can actually sit down and enjoy your meal here...I hate that chinese places are only takeout spots with maybe 2 tables and everyone coming in stares at your plate of food while hovering over it as they stand in line. Cant stand that !
Oh, and the veggie eggrolls were a little cold inside and they were just ok...but everything else was good.
They have cheap lunch specials too.
Probably be back if we are in the area again !"
S6TMBqrsi4PLRFoQFPScjQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"I have been here several times, this is one of my favorite vegan restaurants in Arizona ! AZ is fortunate to have several! I walked in here tonight and my heart filled with happiness to see so many people here embracing the vegan lifestyle, after all peace begins on our plates!!!

Everything I have tried here is delicious....from comfort food with their burgers and fries to their bowls, delicious specials, salads and appetizers. Big wac is definitely a go to when I want something "" bad"" .

I have taken both my carnivore hubby and child here in the past ( but they both are now vegetarians ~ by choice.....yeah !!! Still hoping they convert though to all plant based diet though )And they even loved it then when they consumed meat.

You order your food at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food out to you. Outdoor seating as well, both in the front or the back of the restaurant . Friendly staff and I cant forget about the desserts next door.....omg....nights on 7th Ave are made for vegan foodies !!!!

I do have to warn you....parking can sometimes be a challenge but the meal is soooooo worth it !!!!"
S-Hksc_Hh_dMEbiTWDnblQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,1,"I have driven to this place 3 times now, each time was closed...I finally saw someone taking care of the gardens and asked and he said they close at 3 every day. I was really hoping to try this place but wasnt able to....due to the hours, I probably never will either :("
6ZIHxvFTHC1pvAzAS0uLDA,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Great baguettes that you can also take home and I really enjoy the vegan/vegetarian sandwich  option here. Very tasty for a $3.00 sandwich! I also get an iced Vietnamese plain coffee here and those bad boy keeps me up all night long....its so strong...I kid you not, had the coffee had 3:30 in the aftetnoon and I actually went to bed @7:30 am the next day......couldn't fall asleep....perfect road trip companion. Those coffees do it to me every time ! Anyways bring cash or they have an ATM inside !"
PEnlf5CJ8JJonph2jIljCg,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,3,"I am from New York and when I woke up this morning, I was craving a New York bagel so I whip out my handy dandy phone and google New York bagels and to my surprise, this places comes up.

I walk in and immediately am overwhelmed with their enormous selection of baked goods. We decided to stay and eat so as I was looking through their large selectioned menu and opted not to get a bagel but pancakes instead. Not sure why, I should have stuck with just a bagel but nooooooo the fat girl wanted strawberry shortcake  pancakes instead....well nothing to brag home about. They werent bad but they werent the greatest either.

Large menu with lots of breakfast itrms and lunches, I will try this place again BUT probably stick with a bagel or breakfast item or even their case out front for a goody to take home ....There lunch menu wouldnt bring me back there.

But the service was fast, very packed and still manged to get everyone in and out in a quick manner. Our waitress was friendly too."
h4W7AUaw3Amqs2vyMDgDDQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,2,"Revisited restaurant twice since last review and service was soooooo slow, one time we were there for over 2 hours before our food came out ALSO asked for thai hot and it was barely hot. Very inconsistent....very unorganized, not sure what happened to this place.....its gone downhill."
QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"I really enjoy this vegan restauran, not only do they have vegan items but raw items as well . I love the drinks, smoothies, juices, and all their food but they lost a star due to their desserts. I love they have vegan and raw desserts but they lack flavor, so this disappoints me with them.....but I really do enjoy everything else. Drinks are a little pricey which is unfortunate but I will treat myself with one when I am here.

They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner here BUT after 8 pm to the last hour open, you can only order food from the counter and everything is served in plastic (take out containers ) that you can eat outside or towards the front even though they close at 9.

My son says the gila nachos are best he has ever had. He LOVES them !

They have a happy hour that you can try some of their small bites / plates til 6 pm, Mon -Fri. Definitely worth it if you want to try some things from the menu."
ZhjU0FkCIaG43F83TwSN8w,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,5,"I actually love this place....all the games and drinks you can have here untill your heart is content !!! The games are fun for the young and old, I think I have more fun here running around playing games then any other arcade in the area. They even have a cool photo booth. They hold special paperview events here (UFC, boxing,etc ). Lots of TVs for sport enthusiasts! This place also has a rooftop bar thats a lot more quiter than the downstairs (unless there is live music out front ), but its not always open....I am thinking only on the weekends????!?!! You can rent out one of their rooms for any function you may have ( bridal shower, birthdays, team building, etc ). If you sign up online and register your card, you get $10.00 of free play money to spend on games all the time. When you use your card on drink and food purchases you accumulate points for free and discounted stuff ! They also have specials, but you have to go online to check them out !"

hRL_qCrcu9UL773su0QabQ,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,3,"Had heard decent reviews of the sushi so decided to try on a Friday night for a place with a little more atmosphere and people watching. I'm a Sakana fan myself.

So, the first thing that sets me off is the fish smell when I walk in the door - not good to sour the stomach of this midwestern girl turned sushi lover with the smell of pond and old fish. I won't waste your or my time with obtuse banter so here is the rundown:
- Atmosphere: typical black and red Japanese decor
- Bathrooms: cool stone sinks that drip and slosh water on your feet so be aware
- Sashimi: overpriced, so-so quality, served in a glass bowl over ice
- Rolls: underwhelming
- Calipico soda: fabulous
- Deserts: yummy but small
- Birthday celebrations: abundant and noisy with little tambourines that lit up"
AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,5,"I ate here for a business meeting - I knew it was a nice restaurant but am ashamed to admit I did not know it was a AAA 5-diamond. I was a little taken aback but the decor is so simple so you would never know it when walking it.

What you immediately notice is the service and attention to detail. The hand-painted menus, Pima language in your introduction, and courses representing life's journey. They had me at ""would you like a slice of key lime, cucumber, lemon, tangerine, cucumber...for your water?"" ....now that's attention to detail.

The chef sent out a special amuse bouche of buffalo tartar - I don't remember .I had the heirloom tomato, goat cheese & marscapone tart - it was the size of a muffin tin but I could have eaten a pie plate full. It was a delightful layering of sweet, creamy and tangy and the ""black ice"" was black gold - sprinkled ice crystals of reduced balsamic magic.

Another special chef treat was a palate cleanser of pomegranate and pepper sorbet served in a small metal bird's nest like dish. I skipped the rest of the journey and went straight for the buffalo tenderloin. I have never had buffalo like this...buttery medium-rare with local flavors of saguaro blossom and cholla buds.

Coffee was served tableside in individual French presses - my favorite. (Maybe I'm not such a country girl after all)  3 hour dinner, too bad I didn't valet park and get the thank you gifts mentioned in other reviews!

Most people probably can't get over the price - it was amusing to see different guests (ages, socioeconomic status, etc.) and their attitudes toward the experience.  All dress seems to be welcome - I had to laugh because there was a couple that totally looked like the Carl's Jr .steak sandwich commercial - she's in a bright blue spandex dress and he's in campshirt  and shorts....Arizona is casual but have some respect.

My country upbringing and lack of exquisite dining experience was growing uneasy with the constant service, being called Ms. all night long, etc. but I slipped into the luxury quite easily...life is good, exceptional food is bliss and Kai should be a goal for everyone to splurge on."
jOJaJatp88cqnkVo8D8RJg,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,4,"This is still my all time favorite sushi place....atmosphere is strip mall blah but the price and sushi is fabulous.

Their baked scallops or langostino's are fabulous. Their Vegas roll is deep fried and though not as refined as Ra's version still very satisfying. Sashimi portions are large and fresh. I also recommend the escolar...slightly grilled with a sauce. Salmon dynamite is good as well. Always something new, though the ""crab with a K"" in everything is a little disappointing but it's usually out shined by great toppings.

The miso soup and iced green tea are good and you can't go wrong with a sake-bomber!!"
k1c_bC3DK6mKg797vH1T8w,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,3,"I'm really struggling with this one...I so wanted to be blown away but all I wasn't.
I went to experience the 5 stars everyone else talked about but ended up just going to get my grease on (though it was topped off with an amazing desert!) in a great looking place.

I really struggled with beet appetizer...didn't realize it would be served hot and I generally take a description for it's word on it's ingredient list but I was straining to find any feta cheese and eventually found a couple small melted white specks among the beets. Nevertheless it was tasty...

Of course I couldn't not order  bacon, cheddar biscuits but the vision of them  melting in my mouth was replaced with crunchy greasy salty bits. Not awful...but there was wilted angst toward that basket thought should have contained a true sin biscuit. In addition I was wholeheartedly disappointed in the candied jalapeño orange butter - it was lacking both jalapeño and orange. *Sigh*

The main course of green chile stew was good but slighted due to the previous orderings...good corn bread though sparsely proportioned and heavy on the butter/oil . Again, the description included cotija cheese and there were literally 5 crumble pieces on top. My immediate thought was that this would be an amazing breakfast leftover addition and indeed it was!

I have to say that we were delightfully surprised by the coconut cake desert adventure - outstandingly good with brown butter ice cream!

Service and atmosphere were as previous reviews and worth another trip back though the drinks were very light on alcohol. I think the happy hour or Sunday special  deserve a chance and we'll likely be back to take another stab."
PBEUEK39haiJhQzuW4tnYQ,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,4,"This is a belated review....
We went for New Year's  dinner two years ago and though it was freezing out side the food was amazing. I can't remember the courses but everything was delightful - very unique and local. I used to work nearby and went to the farm often. With a new job I've lost time and am not in the area as much and pretty much forgot about it.
It's defintiely a hidden treasure and I plan on making a reservation soon!"
sWwCwjsd27k0Y8m1RIWZEg,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,4,"Expensive, relaxed, sultry, with a ginormous motherload sized patio and courtyard area - quintessentially Phoenix (or should I say PV).

My first time here ever so cannot compare to the old and on a Wednesday didn't have a reservation so was seated in the bar patio with the bar menu. The cheese & charcuterie platter was fabulous but the steak & onion soup was the rogue menu addition and bad order choice (great steak but processed onion flavor).  ***Warning*** $15 Chopin martinis...but it was fabulous and so was the view. I could really learn to love $15 martinis here.... of course I can also imagine the valet bringing me back a Bugatti when I leave.

Eager to return for a main course or happy hour again..."

Good wine pairings and sake selections. Rolls are almost all identical to each other. The cherry and orange blossom are great but my favorate is the ""atkins roll"" wrapped in cucumber not seaweed and rice...

Plain but good miso soup. The happy hour menu looks amazing and inexpensive - would definitely venture here for that..."
2D2NpSJDyQCBKPRboUcKWQ,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,4,"Great selection of appetizers, rice and noodle dishes and of course pho!
I like the signature  Anise noodles but there is never enough sauce. Though the staff is always keen to tell you 'the only other place that serves this is in Paris!"".
Will definitely start branching out and trying other dishes.

Clean and great service...and you can go across the street for gelato or boba tea!"
C8D_GU9cDDjbOJfCaGXxDQ,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,4,"Great staff to serve as your menu and libation sherpa - which is definitely needed.

Had a few of the signature dishes - pretzels (not enough cheese for all the pretzels), ribs, fried chicken and salted carmel pudding. All were good with interesting flavores but the fried chicken and carmel pudding with caramel popcorn on top were by far the best. The mashed p's and gravy were marginal.

The drinks were great - creative ingredients and names. Went for lunch so can't comment about crowd and volume but the decor is pretty sweet so would definitely want to come back for the evening partay."
Bkkwt8E9MHvgCHn4lUFtow,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,2,"Never in a gazillion years would I expect to take people to a Roy's and have a bad food experience - pigs are flying.
I took some employees and their spouses out for a year end thank-you dinner. While the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna appetizers were great, that's where the good part of the meal ended. My butterfish, usually mouth watering yumminess was so-so and served with white rice. Other dishes at the table like the swordfish and petite filet were dry and flavorless.
I'd prefer not to delve more into the embarassment that was this dining experience....needless to say I have since eaten at the Chandler Roy's and had my faith restored - but I pressed my luck at the JW location and pulled up a big Whammy."

Not so much a fan the roast beef sandwich we had but the beet salad and pizza is phenomenal.

Had two completely different experiences with the homemade donuts - first time they were dark but amazing, second time they were white, doughy, chewy and icky. The waitress didn't seem to care and acted like it was our problem and didn't take them off the check or try to give a us new ones. **Note to self -  If they are very light  - send them back!!

In my new quest to schlep my self through as many new dining spots as possible, I was fortunate enough to receive an invite to Tuck Shop from a great co-worker. Aside from the multiple attempts to get the name right prepare yourself for at least one phonetic faux pas on the phone with friends...

You are welomed with a small sign made of kids' blocks...so you know that you are in for a treat. It's like how I would love my house to be if I had a 50's-60's  ranch block. Decent sized bar, various seating arrangements and chair assortments with onr large table  in the middle and a cozy lounge area.

The chorizo stuffed dates with arugala were delish - so simple but the savory crispy chorizo with sweet gooey date and a little melted cheese on top peppered with a small bite of arugala just go so well together.  The mac and cheese was ok...needed salt and pepper and a little more moisture.

We ordered the chicken and white cheddar waffles - but we passed as they were out of  waffles. Instead we went with the red beans and rice with linquisa sausage and shrimp and the maple roasted pork tenderloin. The red beans and rice had amazing flavors with the spicey and sweet sausage with just a hint of cinnamon. Some of the beans were a little hard but it was easy to overlook because everything tasted so good. The pork was ok - the maple and mustard seed sauce was good...almost undercooked but juicy and great flavor. But I have to say the gorgonzola grits really turned me off...I kept thinking my old bikram yoga clothes were under the table or something. Maybe I'll try the grits next time sans stinky cheese.

And yes, the meal ended with tiny little cookie dough balls...
Excellent service and tasty zingy gingerale.  I am so looking forward to trying the chicken!!!!"
SB1uPuZGKOWtoCKFFP2ODg,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,4,"I think I've died and gone to British beer heaven just down the road....
The food is ok - traditional bar food with some English twists. The dinners are usually better and the crab cakes rock.
I love being able to watch rugby and it's the only place I know of that you can get a splash of black current juice with your Guinness! That and some bubbles and squeak.....and if you're lucky, some pipers will stop in and serenade you. Can't get much better than that."
nzbQXU2x7O8oucKGthUT3g,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,2,"High expectations fell short....
Have seen the one in Old Town Scottsdale and heard ""rave reviews"" so anticipated a happening scene with fab wood fired oven pizza for a New Year's dinner.
Perhaps my Lasik surgery the day before altered my perception in ways I had not anticipated but I really thought that Chuck-e-cheese himself was going to saunter through the dinning room at any moment.

The white pizza left everything that white pizza is somewhere in the kitchen. Thankfully my tastebuds were rescued by the sausage, ricotta and roasted red pepper pie. A few salads and of course pizza at +$2 per topping.

Luckily we had a fun group there and I'll have to think about going back. I think I'll stick to my local favorites for truly amazing pizza like Nello's and Four Peaks."
PERCOYjFcIkwTaqOWz9G6w,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,1,"I've been 4 times. The first 2 the food was ok, the soda bread dry and tasteless and the service was no where to be found.

The music has been decent the decor is what you want in a nice local pub but the last two visits made me realize this is only a place where you can go if you are white and know people behind the bar. I love Guiness and it's depressing to go to a bar and not get asked what you want to drink for nearly 20 minutes. I've many friends of varying ethinic  backgrounds express this same sentiment. Additionally, one trip resulted in us leaving because apparently we sat at a table that was reserved for ""regular folks"". Who knew that first come first seated and served doesn't apply - they should put up a sign."
59OgPGGzKFYqwSG_U06kuA,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,3,"Not that I know what good or real Korean is...but I am a fan of any good asian-type cuisine.

Simple decor and we were attended to quickly (I think we were the second table). The table ordered the Korean BBQ ribs and I got the dolsot (I think). The meat was greasy, fatty with very light sweet sauce - just the way it's supposed to be. The dolsot came served in a huge stone smoking hot bowl. You have to stir it with your spoon to get all the rice, veggies and meat mixed up and a little crispy hot. Not  a lot of flavor but an interesting option for something new.

The sides were good though maybe uninspired. Who knew that Koreans ate appleas and mayonnaise just like I did in the midwest! It was a good sweetness to counter the spicy kim-chee!

A good option in downtown Chandler when you want to eat outside the box."
Mul_BVwcnhqmp2h_7QFepQ,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,2,"I was soo wanting to like this place...
Hottie boyfriend came home one night and said ""hey, I saw this cool wine bar on Mill that didn't play techno music or look too pretentious...""
Sweet I thought so we went a few days later. Only a few tables were taken late on a Saturday night, we were in luck (so we thought). Waitress was decent but didn't enlighten us as to the fact that they had flights of wine. Fortunately I did not experience the ""dude"" guy I've read about in other posts but I don't doubt he's alive and well there.
Let's fast forward with the server/patron banter so I can save you the agony...
We tried a Chilean wine that was amazingly dark, thick, and chocolatey. The bruschetta got us hook line and sinker with all the amazing flavor combos like fig-prosciutto-marscarpone...but I thought bruschetta was toasted bread? Maybe it's like the Wendy's breakfast commercial and panini really does mean eggy-bacon-boat...but I digress. So we got  the bruschetta and I wanted to pretend like I was 9 and scrape of the toppings and not eat the stale un-toasted bread. But wait - the final piece was toasted and actually warm...and it wasn't that bad.
I really wanted to like this place - it's a perfect people watching spot on Mill (itself worth the price of a glass of wine). We had a good time despite the food but I'm not sure I can get into cold untoasted bruschetta, no matter how hard they try to dazzle you with fancy schmancy topping-bling."
pjtqvDEZgadrb37NV4gqzg,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,2,"I don't even know where to begin....which is ironic because it was hard to find this typical east valley type bar-in-a-strip-mall. I really wasn't sure what to make of the place with the crabby face on the door.
There are couple different areas to the place and when packed I could see it having a college house party charm. But empty, you just get the smell of fried food and punching while watching younger folks who think they got dressed up to go to Scottsdale but instead ended up in a Gilbert strip mall.
I was here to listen to some accoustic sets - not the best  venue for that. Distracted by the TVs, Golden Tee video screen, and a real punching bag game machine (as macho as it gets boys)...So I had one drink, one drink only ($6.50 for Jameson's...really Toby?!?!) and am still perplexed at what this place is trying to be and why they would let people punch a bag during an accoustic music set. Big patio outside, big room inside with a stage and punching machine, and a smaller room for darts and pool. It was kind of like the place I worked back in Iowa that had a buffet, bowling alley, roller rink and minigolf. you can't be all things to all people...but maybe in Gilbert that's a possibility."
u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,4,"Oddly enough I only came to this location after visiting the new Gilbert location. Have to say I think I like the Gilbert locale better and I'm almost a little sick hearing myself say that. Not sure what was up with the rap music on this visit as I am in love with the music at the other locations. Not a great fan of the valet either as they don't seem to know how to dive manual cars or operate emergency  brakes.

So, I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the whole concept and the food (and assuming it will be better next time) but in my heart it gets 3 stars."
oj8qk3W7O9oq15VIs-vYJQ,h3Iydnd3iXDD_cAln6HhlQ,2,"Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)

The appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star.
Peach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for...

I highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in."
HquzxaAEIBBV4-T4xFhJyw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,5,"This place is fantastic. Found it on Yelp and was so happy that I did. Their sandwiches are outstanding! The whole place has a very hip vibe to it that you do not find in surprise, and I really, really, hope that they open another location in Palm Valley. Family run restaurant, great food, great service, must try."
es3Fq9KNp6Ry994x4T4ZYg,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,I stopped in for the first time last week and had a great lunch! The shredded beef has a little heat to it...Tortillas are fantastic...Great rice and beans...An INCREDIBLE value for around $5.00. I will be going back quite a bit.
OFacUbdk0t-GJ83GQ83LOw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"Qdoba, Chipotle, and Costa Vida, are all very similar and provide the ""Subway experience"" with Mexican food. What sets Qdoba apart is that they incorporated some outstanding sauces into their food which give you more options. Instead of having a chicken burrito, you can have a Ancho Chili BBQ Chicken Burrito, or a Spicy Quesso Chicken Burrito. There food is great and the menu gives you a lot more options than Chipotle does."
Y1-nbySEHec051ix7beSGw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,3,"This should be a 5-star place because the food and drinks are great! I just can't figure out why they don't clean it up a little bit? The tables and chairs are cheap and rock back and forth, there is a disgusting aquarium in the back of the restaurant that everyone hates (just read the other reviews), and it really needs a lot of cosmetic help. I feel like the owners/managers need to go on Yelp and read the reviews so that they can make a few simple changes and turn this into the best spot in the West Valley."
owRpTuIch1DGwbt4Wwl1NQ,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"Fantastic food! The custards are great, love the burgers, just tried the ""Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich"" and loved it! I have only been a handful of times but I really enjoyed it."

The dishes that we all love like Orange Chicken aren't very good despite using chicken breasts and good ingredients. You can tell that it is quality, but there is no ""pop"" to it. However, the mu shu wrap is outstanding (add a little plumb sauce), and the Mongolian grill is pretty solid but could use more options.

Here is your Mu Shu fortune cookie:

EDa7_YfEB2HDOyxDMbipQA,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,5,"Their pizza is fantastic! I was honestly shocked by how good it is. They have a slightly ""chewy"" crust with great toppings and at a very fair price. Two thumbs up!"
xzj6q131hJE59tBkhe3Gag,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,Food was great! Pita is amazing... Prices are a little high for lunch and the area/parking is not great.
SdO1UHwE8Rjz3Pz2lBUa5w,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"Rudy's is not the ""typical"" BBQ that most of us are used to, it's Texas style which can be very surprising to people if you haven't had it before or if you aren't expecting it. Texas style has almost no sweetness in the sauce or dry rub; it is more of a salty, tangy, spicy flavor. With that in mind, it is very good! The turkey is surprisingly fantastic and the brisket and pork are very good.

Rudy's is a fun place to visit and enjoy some really good food, just be prepared that it might not be what you are used to."
9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,5,"I hate to give this place a great review...It's already hard enough to get a table! But it is flawless. Honestly, I cannot think of one thing that I would change about the atmosphere, service or the food. The sandwiches at lunch are absolutely incredible, they actually bake the bread for each order, then assemble your sandwich (name one other restaurant that does that). I really try to give good feedback on Yelp, but this place is flawless.

That being said, don't go into it expecting it to be flawless- you're always disappointed when you do that (like an over-hyped movie). Expect it to be a solid ""8,"" and it will blow your mind. That's good advice that you can use in life ;-)"
ept9mIlqGIsemr6w0RczaA,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"Great food, urban environment, and free parking in downtown Phoenix! I had the Chicken Pita Cheese steak, and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants the ""downtown experience"" without the hassle of downtown."
_ZKsdEkQ5K_CUSBtahjFAA,ClkraWv4BIToeNhN4FrjIA,4,"This is the best deal out there. Wife and I wanted something light for dinner, we both ordered French Onion Soup which comes with an assorted breadbasket. Soup and bread were fantastic, and the bill came to $11.22 including tax! We tipped extra because I was kind of embarrassed by how low our bill was, and the service was great. This is a great choice for a light meal."

My favorite dish to order is the Turkey Bolognese, the sauce is lovely and I really enjoy the brown rice penne. I am also a fan of the goat cheese and fig tarte as an appetizer, it's really good and just the right size. Last time I went there I tried the lemon tarte and let me tell you, it was delicious! The coconut cream was superb and the tarte wasn't too sweet, letting the lemon flavor shine through!

As with the food, I have only had good service at True Food Kitchen. The servers are well trained and always make dining there a pleasant experience!"

I just went here for the first time and I was surprised by how good the food was since I haven't found a good mexican restaurant since moving to Phoenix. The food here was incredible- I ordered the Green Chile Plate and the beef was melt in your mouth delicious as was the tortilla. The salsas that were served were delicious as well, and I preferred the green one! Nothing was too spicy but it had a good amount of spice. I will undoubtedly be coming back here when I crave mexican food."
utoTa3Ngv_oSfB5TIMgN_Q,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,1,"Oh Rula Bula, I hate that this is how my last visit turned out. As evidenced by my former review, you used to be my favorite bar on Mill until last Friday, June 15th. I decided to have my birthday party and moving away party at Rula Bula. You guys were charging cover and would not let me in for free even though it was the day of my birthday. Seriously? You guys must be the only place on Mill with that policy! So I paid because this is where I told all of my friends I'd be and I went inside. Well apparently you don't do well in the customer service training area because the red headed girl taking the money outside was sweet enough to call me a b*tch while my boyfriend was still right there. While workers will gripe about customers, it would most certainly bode well for you to tell your employees to at least wait until the whole party said person arrived with has gone inside because saying that in front of people doesn't really help build good customer relations.

The only upside is that Emily was good server, she was attentive, though our car bombs were skimpy. Over all I am saddened that I will have to find a new place to hold my coming back party when I come to see all of my friends."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,4,"Four peaks is awesome! The beer is great (it even comes in 10oz glasses) and the french fries are incredible!

u6xb2aUAvX6i1WhsQWqgWg,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,5,"I went to the one in Scottsdale and ordered the chicken tenders with a waffle and some corn bread. Holy poop, was it delicious! The waffle is the only waffle I've ever had that wasn't bettered by putting butter on and the chicken fingers were the best me and my boyfriend had ever had! They were fried to perfection! The corn bread was perfect as well!

There was only one place where Lo-Lo's could have messed up but they didn't. I ordered a waffle with my chicken tenders but they gave me fries instead. With no hassle at all they told the kitchen to make me a waffle and the General Manager told the waitress to let me keep the fries.

Btw, if anyone wants a great example of how a GM should be, go eat at Lo-Lo's. The GM was so friendly, seemed to work well with his staff, treated his customers well and with respect and was just above and beyond the GM's you see in many stores!"
h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,5,"Out of all of the local Indian restaurants I have tried, Royal Taj is by far the best! The curries are amazing and the meat (and paneer) is always tasty! While the people who own the restaurant may seem a bit distant, they are just shy and open up when you talk to them! Be sure to come here when you crave good Indian!"
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,3,"I have been to Green on several occasions and I have never been as impressed as my friends. The jerk tofu and spicy peanut salad are good, but I feel they are overpriced for a few pieces of tofu/meat substitute and plain greens. The green burger was okay but I was surprised by how thin the patty was.

I am in love with their french fries, however! They are incredibly tasty, whether plain as a side or as an appetizer as the vegan chili fries (by far the best item of their menu!).

The tsoynamis are delicious no matter what flavor you get and that is definitely a selling point!"
L9qDnDHSnINNjePwrJz-uQ,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,4,"The food here is always solid. Last time I went I ordered the gnocchi which was delicious and well cooked, though it was heavy with the kind of sauce it was paired with. Whenever I want some good Italian food I come here since the food is good and the owner is always very nice."

Mul_BVwcnhqmp2h_7QFepQ,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,3,"La Bocca is often hit or miss, especially in terms of service. As for their food, their pizza's are great, as is their goat cheese and pear salad, but other salads are over priced and give you very little food. I also recommend never ordering a mojito there, as mine was bland, overly sweet and had dried mint in it."
UAE4XWXwlALJsq8yycmW5w,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,3,"Wildflower is just okay. Their breakfasts are delicious (I love their roasted veggie frittata) but when breakfast is over, so is my love for them. I personally find very few things on their menu to be exciting but I do appreciate that it is one of the few places in the valley that serves a daily rotating menu of soups, even if that menu does not always match up with what is listed online. Another major issue is their consistency, or lack thereof. Sometimes your order will be overflowing with a specific topping and other times it will be non-existent. If you do go, be sure to try their oatmeal butterscotch kiss cookie, it is really tasty!"
PWW_jT4tHP_r1S18ePJyTQ,szKOnN0pWYUJfxEGpRIqnw,4,"This is the place to go if you are looking for fresh, healthy food! The menu has tons of options for any sort of eater and serves many locally grown and/or organic foods. My personal favorite is the avocado, mozzarella and tomato!"

I always get a 1/3lb or 1/2 burger and I love that there's a condiment bar so you get to dress your burger to your liking!

The goat cheese on it was perfect and the roasted sweet corn added a nice pop to every bite! I also ordered the Pizzeria Chopped Salad which was just okay, it was bland, but the pizza more than made up for it.

The service was also wonderful. While waiting for a table I was able to attend a wine tasting and the waitress was very nice."

The ladies who own the restaurant are always there, one making buns and dumplings, and one running the front of the house. When asked what to order, the owner will point you in the direction of the steamed beef buns, the cheapest and tastiest item on the menu! The fried chicken noodles are also delicious and nothing on this menu is expensive! It's easy to have a filling meal for two come out to $15 after tip!

The place is rather small so you may have to wait for a table, but as evidenced by the sound of Mandarin being spoken throughout the restaurant, it is clearly a place that has good food."

I walked in and no one acknowledged our existence. 3 women were standing there and did not even look up or say hello. We ate there anyways after finally getting a seat. The buffet food was horrible! All of the meat dishes were gross regardless of what it was. It didn't even look like meat. The chicken, the BBQ, the roast beef (very rubbery), and even the fish was gross. After the first sample plate I decided to eat only the vegetables and that too did not have flavor.  The spring rolls were bad and the ice cream was even bad. How can you mess up on serving decent ice cream?
Ok... There is also a sign that they have up that says "" 20% fee for anyone that wastes food"". I don't waste food but I guess you have to do what you have to do.
All of the employees there seemed pissed off and no one smiled at all. It was just not a place that has any respect and I felt that could care less if we came back. So with that being said- I do not recommend anyone eating here.

I really hate writing bad reviews but I am only stating the facts here."
09psTuUYhUMA2ZRzQlm30Q,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,We paid $17 for a single cheeseburger and a double cheeseburger with any toppings of our choice plus two drinks. We shared a regular fry. The burger was good and the people were nice.

Its a smaller place that has good food but space is limited here. The only thing that I didn't like is the waitress did not check up after we ordered everything we were ordering. I had to flag someone down after getting our food. The service is friendly but if being a waitress is your job then ask me if  how my food is or if I need anything else! Not too much to ask.. Lol
JIETwXSEGIHMNyxZVEnNKQ,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,The food is really good. I enjoy the protien bowls and the salads. Just keep in mind- ITS ALWAYS BUSY during lunch! Its not a get in and out kind of place. Love the food.

Someone that we were with had the spicy BBQ chicken and that too was good. Everyone was nice. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because for some reason they didn't have ac in the bathroom. Its summer so I got hot while waiting. It may have been just the day or who knows it may be the slow economic times. I will return for dinner. :)"

There's a waiter named Polly that's pretty good at remembering our names and is excellent at his job.  The only complaint that I have is that they don't ever show any fights here but there are many other places that do. I can come here for the food and cold beers.
POO5_d0RwzjJVhIpN-oulg,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,"I love love love this place.  I usually come here with a group of friends and we do the ""Teppan Style"".   I love this place more than any other teppanyaki place.  My food is always good and I have always had a reallly good cook with a great performance. I can't wait to go again. :) Yummy!

The only thing I have a problem with is when we go there with big groups the waitresses tend to take your order and then disappear. They are nice but sometimes hard to get back. I like to always have a drink available and I like it when they check on me. I guess it's hit and miss."
VYLQ3bMCqmHiNO2FS8aAsg,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,"I have only ordered food for delivery and it was delicious! The party pizza is huge and the prices are great. We had pizza, anitpasto salad, and the wings (bone in and boneless). Everyone loved it and will definitely eat there again."
0xyqLvtr0Zbr4G-gML-QmQ,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,3,"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary.  We had the peppercorn steak, Flemings Potatoes, and a salad.  The food was good but not great. I think we could have split the steak and potatoes and ordered our own salad. We also had two beers and one drink. I ordered a cheesecake to go and they forgot the sauce that went with the cheesecake.  Our bill came to $133.00. Now I'm not sure what part of that experience was worth what we paid. There wasn't anything about the food or the experience that was that spectacular."
VcGyezSNtkNBr2HidcaM1A,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,"I ordered a pizza for myself to go. I ordered a small 10"" with pepperoni and jalepenos. I ordered a 5 and might try the 4 next time. There jalepenos are pretty spicy. The dough was different and didn't weigh me down. I liked the sauce too. I will eat there again. The women that helped me may have been the owner- she was also friendly."
jqAdZf9PJo8lsRskc6T1Sw,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,3,I don't really know what to say. I ordered a carne asada burrito and it was just ok. The meat didn't have that much flavor and there was nothing else in it- just bland meat and the tortilla. The best part was the tortilla and the red sauce which was actually hot. I love hot sauce that is actually hot! Lol  it's going to be hard for me to eat there again because there wasn't a taste to crave. :(
0kyhbUW6NkpYjJzFBZ64vQ,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,I ordered a egg salad sandwich from here and I would not recommend it. It only had egg and mayo and the egg was so smashed. Sorry but I have had a really good egg sandwich and this one was pretty bad. :(
oPkaBoX_0hVIBV_VXp7nlA,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,5,"This was the first time that I ate here and I too am glad that it opened up near me. I have not heard of this place but saw it while visiting San Tan Mall. I ate here for lunch and I tried the Texas Beef Brisket Sandwich and fries with baked beans. The Sandwich was great, the fries were cooked well, and the bean were flavorful. The beer was really cold and so was the glass and that was very important for me. The prices for lunch were great and the people were all very nice.

Oh and another important thing is the bathrooms were clean! I don't have one reason not to give them anything but 5 stars. Yay."
mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,3,"I love the pizza. As for the people... Well not much. Employes are not that friendly at all. Always have to wait like if it's a privilege just to get waited on by someone. It's obvious something is wrong or they might actually be smile at someone. They just kind of stare like : ""what do you want""? It's unfortunate."
D2_y52mbmTrNLHux6aCrIg,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,"I eat here often.  I order the ribs, BBQ chicken, and salads. I like the bread too! I have not had bad service here but I also have not had great service. I will continue to eat here."
nUfeYJ_YEaDzggPKnYry3g,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,3,"I ate here a couple weeks ago and it was about a 45 min.-1 hour wait.  I had the enchiladas and they were really good. What I got upset about is the waitress forgot to put our food in. She also did not check to see if we need another drink or refill on our drinks. My husband had a beer and was not asked once if he needed another one and she was no where to be found. They could have made more money on the beers. Once she remembered our existence she did apologize and was nice but how the hell can you forget about my meal. They seriously should have offered it to us for waiting a very long time while everyone else was getting served. I had to wave her down for her to check on our food.  Oh... The person serving us water was the best part of our experience because he made sure our water was always topped.  Very frustrating on how we were not compensated and we still tipped (not sure why).

I will however try it again in hopes of better customer service and will write another updated review. It may take me a while considering......  That's too bad because I eat a lot of mexican food and they are right down the street from me."
VMr8sgoQOW0fo0qVJENajA,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,I ate here for the hundredth time and this time had the glass noodles. It has vegetables and I added fried Tofu. De-lish!
8lH63_WY0kOFSZhMrgJXGg,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,5,Maria's is a fast food Mexican place that is really good. I usually get the street tacos or California burrito! Both are really good and affordable. Everyone here is really nice. Glad I found it!
JJhnw7WJDuMHtK5i30EpGQ,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,5,"I ate there again and they have changed there containers to recyclable ""to go"" containers. :) The food was de-lish again."
9njwmO6YzhaQB3-htNMFYQ,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,5,"Good food, good vibes, and good place! We brought our 3 year old and she got a key to the treasure if she was ""good"" throughout the meal. Of course she was and she was happy she got to take a gift home. She already asked to come back. Lol  The only thing I recommend is that if you have a kid is to request a booth or a regular table or they might try and seat you at a bar height table which was too high for 3 year old. Other than that everything was all good! :)"
9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,5,Everyone is friendly which is really important to me. The good vibe is always welcomed. The food is always good and I can't wait to eat there again!
axi57Y3h5c8BxM1Xyj0KBw,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,5,"I love eating here! The first time I ate here the manager introduced himself and was very kind in making sure everything was to our satisfiaction. I think his name was John but not sure...  Very social man. I have always received great service at this location in Gilbert. I also always bring my guests here to eat. The beer is always cold and the pizza is great. The only problem is on the weekends there is always a wait unless you find a spot at the bar. LOL

I have also eaten at the Chandler location and everyone there is really nice but the Scottsdale location people can be quite moody at times. The Scottsdale location is somewhat hit and miss with the employees. It almost seems like if it isn't there job title then they are almost unwilling to help you but like I said it's hit and miss."
TH6mQqMfKATGjuW9SfoVSg,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,1,"I went to this place knowing that it was fast food mexican.  The food was just ok and I've tried it a few times. The people that work there are never nice and have never said Hi or thank you. I'm obviously not going there for the atmosphere but c'mon you could have some manners.
The last time I ate here the girl started mopping under my table that I was eating at and all of the others beside me. The smell of the floor cleaner was so overwhelming it got me sick. I did tell her not to mop near me but should I have to? I won't be eating here again. Even if the food was good it's not worth the attitude this place gives."
6PwKC0dqP9uI85FEP86iPQ,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,"I went into this place for the first time and I thought it was really good.  I ordered the chicken Katsu combination. I also ordered california rolls that were good since I don't eat sushi. My husband had the terriaki chicken and thought my food was better even though his was still good. I would go there again. The Sushi chef was nice too.
The only think that I didn't like was that they gave me one ""not full small bowl"" of rice and I asked for more and they charged me. I have never been to a place that charged extra for rice."
_9vGmNrEcLWFOnUzeUdfag,NAUot-ubXmWmNL8vYEISbg,4,"I love it here. We eat here all of the time. I usually get a Brisket, cheesy potatoes, and beans- All are very flavorful. On the weekends there is always a line out the door but it moves pretty fast. They have a side window so that you can order food to go. You can also call it in and pick it up at the window for faster service. It still tastes great when you get it home. If you haven't eaten here I would definitely give it a try."
utoTa3Ngv_oSfB5TIMgN_Q,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,Ok Irish nachos and beer. I will say the service for a table of 20 was amazing. I just never felt like it was a great experience. I have been back a few times after my first visit. This place has gotten much much better in the past couple of months! This is now one of my favorite places in Tempe.
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,Great food and service every time. With out question ether location for me is a go to restaurant. The Wendy Pickle with OG sauce is the best thing to have here for me. I will continue to come here as long as I am in phoenix for my Green fix. This is coming from an avid meet eater who loves everything food. I find this to be one of my favorite spots in phoenix.
HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,"This is one of those great quite places that you can have a morning meeting in or just relax and enjoy your day.

The food is always great. The service is some of the best that you can ask for. I love the corn beef and fried egg as well as the biscuits and gravy. Oh and lets not forget the coffee I would go there just for a cup of coffee and a quite place to read a book. If you are looking for a good morning out with amazing breakfast look no further."
0H9bomdciJmcqfojkxLnsA,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,1,"Wonderfully forgettable

1. Food was bland, tasteless, and the bottom of my bowl was filled with water.
2. Service was among the worst I have had in a long LONG time. i.e. Water being spilled on our group, snarky comments when there was and issue with the food.
3. While this was a bad experience the manager didn't notice the entire time all of this was going on. When we did bring her attention to the issues she did make it right but to little  to late."
OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,4,Great coffee in a comfortable environment. I love the couches and the DJ that was there that day. I have to say this is one of the few places that I have been with a great espresso shot. Many other places I have been burn the crap out of it. The espresso here was amazing!!! I will be back.
JTNdV6u3DK-wcqX7ZXl5hw,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,2,Veggies not cooked and my bowl was watery. This was my first time at this restaurant and i think my last. Food was not great and the store was kinda dirty and needed a good sweeping. The only ok thing was my sushi and even that was border line ok. Good alternative to panda express in my eyes.
MVSACvnnpDiEDp4FTn1c5A,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,Great location this is a well oiled team working on the lunch shift during the week. I have come here many times and had great service that was fast and friendly. Everything that I could ask for in a lunch time hang out. I will also say the food separation for Vegans\Vegetarians is great and the employees don't mind changing gloves and that is a HUGE plus in my book.
Noi53T0PWNEN9mQRS3-Ncg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,4,My boss picks up Burritos and Fruit smoothies from this place quite often. The food is always good but not mind blowing. I see this as being a great quick stop breakfast. Worth the stop in if you don't have time to make breakfast. I will be returning on my own accord for burritos for hiking and such in the future.
tnG4_L5bZiffTbaFru9EBg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,I came here with some of my family yesterday. This is going to be my new go to for any Mediterranean food or cooking needs. Not only was the food some of the best that I have had in all of AZ the markets selection was amazing. Lots of tea and coffee selections to be had as well as better prices than most grocery stores. Also for the hookah inclined those looking for the best go no further. From Khalil Mamoon's the best hookahs money can buy to AF Shisha. This is going to be a one stop shop for my needs in the valley. Also the owner is very nice and willing to help with any questions from making Turkish Coffee this place has true passion for customer service.
U21YaTK4PVlfNHQSyBkJUg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Visit date 3/24/11:

I was really impressed with our visit. We brought our friends from France and the waitress was really accommodating with our goal of ordering lots to share family style. She even suggested their veggie tamale that was really good. I can't wait to go back and have another. My only qualm? A tiny bit too much cheese drenched on top. I know, I know... anyone who knows me knows I love me some cheese. But the food is so good that it doesn't need to hide under all that cheese!"
ALwfJk1g56dz8ehgYJNrdg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Had dinner there last night and it was a really good experience. Chill but good service and yummy pizza. We got meatball, green peppers, and onions. The green peppers were really fresh and still had a little crunch to them which I loved. We ordered a small pie cause we wanted beers (no YOU'RE an alcoholic!), but the 2 pieces with a soda deal is truly a steal and I'll probably get that one next time. Unless, of course, I need a beer."
mDiFWhywAziq9SKnj6am_Q,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,2,"We ordered the calamari appetizer and the field greens salad. The calamari was ok and it was nice to have two different dipping sauces. The field greens salad was good. I ordered the gnocci and my fiance ordered the linguini in clam sauce. The gnocci was ok, it was very buttery. The linguini pasta was cooked well but the sauce was gross. Like cat food gross. It did not look or taste homemade at all. Very disappointing and as you can tell by the picture there was a lot left. This is odd because my fiance is a garbage disposal. Everyone who knows him knows this, but he did not finish this plate.

The worst? I woke up at midnight very nauseous and threw up.

Thanks Il Posto."
E6Ne9ok_tHvZIeOdWeh40w,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,5,"Just returned from a Sunday afternoon of bloody mary's, wings, fries, and football. The holy trinity. Oops, I guess I'm a little over three things needed for a trinity. Oh well. Needless to say I wasn't rooting for Tebow!

The wings here are amazing. We ordered them medium honey BBQ and they could have been a touch hotter for my taste, but I wasn't complaining. The crispiness of the skin was perfect. We ordered a dozen but filled up with 5 wounded soldiers still on the plate. These wings weren't skimpy, y'all.

The service was awesome and the TVs were perfectly spaced out for prime viewing.

Now if you'll excuse me I need a nap.

Did I mention the Bloody Mary bar? With blue cheese stuffed olives? No, well you might see me there next Sunday."
BvTU8s3v-qfTtsSKV6Y16A,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,3,"Corbin's was A-OK for me. I heard great things about this place and was super hopeful, but it didn't knock my socks off. Maybe it was the time we went (Friday late-night). It was nearly empty and it was freezing inside. I'm not the picky/whiny type but I wished I had chosen to sit outside I was super uncomfortable. Also, the music was odd. Like... really bad. At least it gave us a giggle. Other than those two downers, the ambiance and service were stellar. The inside is really gorgeous.

Now for the food. We got the wings and the stone fired shrimp quesadilla. Wings were good. I didn't like the quesadilla..it should be called a pizza. That bothered me and the flavors just didn't work for me either.

I really loved the beer selection. Very nice and I would go back for a beer on the patio."
HjXI6lKGPVNQ8dYJPtaOCg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Had dinner here after Oktoberfest shenanigans and this place really hit the spot. The service was good and the pizza was fantastic. I love the potato one (don't remember the name) and the crust on the simple pepperoni was stellar. The thai pizza was good, but had a tad too much of the sweet sauce. It's the only one that wasn't wiped clean, which usually happens with that one.

I can't wait for some more of that potato pie... plus they've got the Four Peaks Pumpkin Stout on draft. Holla!"
wxzG81ZyWpBje_mU4aFLaw,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,1,"I was excited to try this place on our side of town as we've had takeout from another location and loved it.

We came in and there was a wait for a two top. No biggie, we both got a glass of wine and waited just a short while before our table opened up. We sat down having had maybe 4 sips of our wine.

We waited.

And waited.

We had our wine....


But no menus.


I joked that it was like Costa Rica and the slow service there. I was in a good mood and happy to sit down after a long day on my feet.

Still with the waiting.


No... STILL MORE with the waiting!

Now it was not funny anymore and we were being completely ignored. I checked my clock and it was 7:57pm. Clearly not a closing time issue. I tried to assuage my companion by telling him how tired I used to get after a big rush and they were probably trying to catch their breath.

Yeah... that argument only holds weight for so long before you realize you've still been sitting there with a glass of wine from the bar and NO MENUS OR ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE. Seriously the guy who seated us was really nice. Where was he?

A girl came around and put place settings out at 4 tables. ALL AROUND US.

Still. No service.

Fuck. Are you kidding me? I was seriously patient. I know what working in the service industry is like. This is ridiculous.

""If we finish our glasses of wine and no one has said a single word to us... we are leaving"".

""But you are not allowed to chug your wine"".

""Deal"".

{{{insert witty conversation for 5 minutes}}}

Alright. All done. We have not sped up our drinking. We were very fair and patient... up we go.

And we left.

Would you have done anything different?"
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Went here last night and had a great time. The wait was super long but we were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar. Our group ordered the calimari and brushetta to start and it was good. The brushetta was a little overloaded and dripped everywhere on me... but that's because I am a spaz when I eat. For pizza we shared the sausage, bbq chicken, and the yukon gold. The bbq chicken was very good, but I was taken aback by how hot the jalapenos were. I had to pick them off, lest they burn me twice. The sausage pizza was very nice and I'd order it again. The yukon gold pizza (with leeks, pancetta, and gorgonzola) was not a hit at our table. Out of the 5 of us, I was the only one that really liked it. Oh well... I got leftovers suckas!"
wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"Had a lovely brunch here and can't wait to go back for dinner. I had the fried egg sandwich which was delicious. My fiance had the frittata because he wanted as much veg as possible after his morning run. I enjoyed my sandwich so much that I didn't get a taste of his frittata. The ambiance was great and we had a bottle of Prosecco to enjoy over a leisurely brunch. I wished I had room for something sweet because a lady near us got the apple pie looking thing and it smelled so good. We debated getting a cinnamon roll to go but another diner near us had a half eaten one left on a plate which signaled to me that it was not to die for. So I passed.

My two complaints about the experience were:
1. The parking. was. ridiculous. There was a mostly empty lot but we were forced to use the ""complimentary"" valet. Complimentary my ass. You have to tip. That is not ""complimentary"". They should allow patrons to park themselves if the restaurant lot is less than half full. Otherwise... I might choose to go somewhere else that doesn't rip me off and waste my time with this nonsense. Seriously, I almost asked him to hand me the keys because the car was 20 feet away. Not cool.

2. The bowl for the potatoes with the egg sandwich is beautiful. However, it is not functional. It scoots all over the plate when you try to get a bite and it wobbles like crazy. Frustrating, because the potatoes were delicious but went unfinished because they were such a pain to eat."
plWuv4gda7m0KlqCNhrb4w,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ,4,"After our first visit a week after opening, it was obvious that there were some kinks to work out. The first visit, I was impressed by the beer selection. It was wonderful and definitely lead to our second visit. The misses to me the first go around were the food and the noise level. The outdoor patio was also very dark. The lighting was better for the second visit, but I have yet to retry the food. I got the pizza but wasn't impressed. Just an odd flavor paring. The noise level wasn't as bad this time, but that could have been because it wasn't as busy and  opening the doors also helped. Can't wait to get back for more good beer and great patio weather soon."
XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,5,"5 star all the way! They have the freshest vegetables and a great menu selection of healthy foods. The vegetable crudités and quinoa burger are amazing! The seasonal grapefruit soda is bomb as well! Only downside is they always seem to be busy, so expect a wait. It is still one of my favs though!"
roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,5,"This is an old school Italian restaurant. They have the best cheese ravioli! My boyfriend really likes the spaghetti bolognese, and pays the extra $3 to add sausage, it's worth it. The house salad the food comes with is very small, but you also get bread so it all evens out."
042IHd5KjHiMuBtGtugO_g,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,5,Very lively place with fun activities and dogs on the patio :) Great customer service as well..... I messed up my food order when ordering from the server and they were kind enough to remake my meal for me! I will definitely be back!
hgc-YJELr_899ExB92z6jw,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,3,"What stands out is that the professionalism of the staff needs to take it up a big notch. We waited a solid four minutes before we were greeted at the door to be seated which I can understand if it's really busy, but as we were leaving there were three hostesses or servers standing at the hostess desk chatting....all three of them were too busy to say thank you for coming in or goodbye. I was shocked because they all saw us leave and didn't say anything.

In regards to the food I had the shrimp... It was good but not good enough to order again. I didn't care for the rice that was paired with the shrimp. I will say though that the mashed potatoes were delicious... My guess is because they were covered in butter (not healthy but tasty). If you order a margarita they will give you a generous portion so that is good too."
vhKUBKcOm8zOLxeS3XM9iA,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,3,"This place is hit and miss. I usually just order a thin crust cheese pizza, but it tastes different everytime I order it (no joke either)! I like the mozzarella sticks though, and they always taste the same. I get vouchers from restaurant.com when eating here...you can get about half off that way."
OASX1Yrgq_7R1PsYpixRcw,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,4,"I was pleasantly surprised. Inside of restaurant is new, nice, clean. They had good music playing (rock/alternative), and 5 flat screens with sports on. They have pizza specials, so we got slices and drinks. FYI happy hour is M-F 2 to 5pm (you get $1 off the specials). We tried cheese, margherita, pesto chicken, and meat lovers. We all liked the pizza. The cheese was my favorite actually. Large, thin slices (for anyone who hasn't been there)."
7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,4,"Well for a vegetarian, I liked this place! Our table had a grilled cheese, breakfast sandwich (this was the best), seasoned fries, and coleslaw. All that with 2 drinks was only $18. Great lunch/dinner stop. It is a hole in the wall kind of place but the staff was super ""chill"" and friendly. I will be back to try the other vegetarian options on the menu."
1YQaI6yyWa8jSzP0jJX0tw,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,5,"They have amazing subs and a great selection of vegetarian subs. It's not exactly cheap, but it's worth it. The Russian dressing that they put on some of the subs is the best. You can also download the cap addicts app to earn free subs."
-RN70NJDP02wVcrg5yPO8Q,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,3,"The guy who waited on us was really nice, so I feel bad not giving this place a better review. It's an ok place if you want to get a beer I guess, but we did not enjoy the food. Sandwich was mediocre, The side salad was alright, but terrible onion rings. The place has older furniture in it, but it does have allot of tv's and horse betting if you are into sports."
kne4oWWLq0FFHLA-gWuqoQ,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,4,We went at 830 am on Sunday and there was no wait. When we tried to go at 1030 last weekend there was a 25min wait. Early bird does get the worm! I enjoyed the eggs Benedict with Black Forest ham. The breakfast was a large and filling portion. Service was prompt and will definitely come back.
fbLYRHIZAt3q839whhaBUg,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,4,"Very reasonable prices....large portions for a good price! The thin crust pizza, garlic cheese bread, bowl o pasta, chicken Caesar salad and pizza cookie are my favs! Only dish I have tried and not liked is the shrimp scampi. It was a bit spicy and the type of pasta (curly noodle things) I didn't care for. This def a ""safe"" choice with good food and fun atmosphere if you are in charge of picking a place to eat. Oh but I should add service can be slow/it takes awhile for food to come out. It's prob because they are always packed."
4p6Wce7Ed707QS2-yQkvZw,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,3,"I went there for lunch with my family. We were not very impressed with the menu, maybe we are just spoiled from normally having lots of options but it was basically salad, burgers, sandwiches, or Mac n cheese. I had the pulled pork but the flavor was too smoky for me. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this place, but we won't be back."
xZhNZb01n9b4e2X7bZdoVQ,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"Great Service, Best Chip and Salsa I have ever had for a long time.
Only gave it four stars because my entree ""Green Chilli Chimi"" was not as good as I anticipated. Not as crispy as other chimichanga I had at other places.
But would love to go back again and try something else."
ACb637NG7EnswRs8U_BX_w,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,1,"If there is a ZERO star, I will do so.

This has been the worst place I have ever been in a long time.

I ordered a mango mojito, and got some berry drink instead. When I asked my server about it, the response i got was ""Oh, I thought that's what you ordered"" and ""I will bring you mango mojito next time.""

Both my friend's salad and my entree had to be send back. (Which she never do and I rarely do.) She ordered a blackberry brie salad. She got pecan cranberry instead. We were told the manager made her second salad, which is 1/2 the size, with 4 blackberry, 4 tiny see through slices of brie, still has the pecan for the unknown reason, and few lettuce.

When I got my med-rare ahi tuna entree, my friend thought I have gotten salmon because it's not the healthy redish tuna color but the whiteish pink color. It was way over cooked! When I address this to our waiter, he just looked at it and say ""yeah, that's way over cooked"" and walked away. It's not till minutes later he asked if I would like them to remake the tuna. The second tuna I got was not any better. It tasted like they put 5 times the seasoning for the whole plate on the little fishes that they serve. It was way over salted and almost tasted gross.

And funny thing was, it was then I really came to appreciate how tart my berry drink is. It took that saltiness off the tuna.

Anyway, with the price of the menu, we were really hoping for a better experience. We didn't get that. We got surprises and questions about how a restaurant  can screw up so much for one table. Mind you, there were maybe only three tables when we first got there on a Saturday night. (And the only table left when we got our food.) We both agree this place don't have a very good chance. But even if it does, I WILL NEVER RETURN!!!!"
Jj8ubiwwuCR-rrhrrjcryw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,5,"This place is located at a somewhat ""ghetto"" area with no decoration, but overall environment is clean with friendly staff.

The menu is authentic with unbeatable price. Their order of spring roll with egg and pork are two for $2.50. Their Egg Sandwich with two sunny side up and Asian pickles are $2.50. Most their noddle dishes are around $5. I usually get two appetizers with one entree for about $10 or so. If you feel trying something adventurous, they also have some authentic exciting items such as duck with sour bamboo soup and such.

They are very good at accommodating your needs. My vegetarian friend got her Tofu Egg Roll and Veggie Pho was super pleased and has visited the place many times since then all the way from Tempe.

I just want to say this place is truly un""PHO""gettable~"
jyZqmlaziZKtPv8AVTzciw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,1,"This is a hard to write review for me. My first visit of this restaurant was in 1999, and I have to say that it has seen better days.

Nothing has changed since 1999, the food was still good, the price is still decent, the decoration, plates and silverware remain unchanged/ renewed either. Oops, one thing did change, it went from a joint family restaurant to one family restaurant. With the slow down business, it's a husband and wife team for the entire place now. So, be prepared for the slowness and the lack of friendly services.

I missed the weekly fresh seafood they used to have. Now they get fresh things about once a month if you are lucky.  I was once very loyal to this place and visit at least weekly if not more. But three bad experiences helped with this review and I will think twice before step in there ever again.

I ordered a rock fish once, and careful as I always am, I double checked the price with them and asked how much does the fish usually weight. We were charged double for the estimate they gave me when we got our bill. She told me it's $13.99 per lb and 3 lbs per fish. We were charged $19.99 per lb and 4.5 lbs for the fish. Though the fish was surely not big enough to fill two of us up, at least they corrected the price with a straight face. (And still charged for 4.5 lbs...) I felt cheated, especially being such a loyal customer for such a long time. The sign is even up on the wall, were they hoping to not have customer check their bills?

How long do you have to wait for a simple won ton soup?! That you ordered to go in advance?! On a one table dine-in slow night?? One hour!!! At least that's how long I waited. And I asked several times, I just kept on got brushed off with almost, almost. Eventually, she stopped responding to me and just walked away. Of all things, won ton soup!!!! It usually take no more than 10 min anywhere else! I was furious for the long wait and the neglect!

The last bad experience I had was when the husband and the wife (chef and the waitress) decided to have an open argument in the restaurant. Though we weren't the only table there, but it was uncomfortable for everyone there. Also, though I am not allergic to fresh shell fish, I am allergic to even pre frozen ones. That's just say the fresh shellfish we ordered that night (I saw them fish it out of the tank!!!) gave me terrible allergy reaction...

I don't know... I have to say I lost faith at this place now... But I surely do miss it's glorious past..."
3vta1BSPwdSulcCFMpBjDw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"I like their lunch bentos and Saturday Ramens.

Bentos are made fresh daily with wide varieties. Rames are limited quantity every Saturday.

But, rest the market are not as impressive. The shelf always seem half empty with not much variety and not much fresh produce to be considered a market.

I will treat this market as a quick grab n' go lunch market, but not going to expect too much other normal market functions from it."
QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"They changed chief couple years ago, and adjusted the menu since then.

I had to say some of the items that were removed from previous menu were my ""must haves"" whenever I go. However, couple of their new stuff is totally worthy of trying.

If you like spicy, authentic Chinese food. You will have to give this place a try.

Do keep in mind, the services can be iffy at times. Once we even waited an hour for our take outs. I guess it depends on your luck for the day."
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"Been there many times. I love the bread and the crust of the pizza. The flavor and the unique topping wins my heart every time.
Dislike the wait time though. The longest record I ever waited was 3 hours. Thank goodness for the Bar Bianco next door to be my waiting shelter.
Will go again when the weather is not too warm and I don't mind waiting outside."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"The beer selection is alright, food was okay.

Fish and chips were good, but fish was a bit small. Fried calamari (with peppered batter) was interesting, but definitely over priced for its portion. ($10 for thing strip of 6 pieces.) We also got french fries Jim style (with green chilli and cheese), I think I will stick to just fries next time.

The night we went, they were packed so it was hard to carry a conversation without yelling.

Don't mind going again maybe for happy hour."
5oeiMlQFtJFZV6H8qatznw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"I have never had Salvarodreno food before and decided to let my taste bud explore.

My friend and I shared an appetizer and each ordered an entree.
The appetizer was big enough for the whole meal for both of us. it was packed with pupusas, deep fried enpenada, fried chips, tamale, and fried yuca.  I wasn't big on the pupusas, but my friend loved them. I would personally prefer the enpenada better.

I got pollo asado for entree. It was nice in portion and decent in flavor. Even I ate them cold as my lunch the day after since I was too full to try them on the night of the visit.

Over all, good experience. Always fun to try something new~"
zOL260xaXDYZZPBItzALxQ,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"I confess, I can't drink regular soda. So I wasn't able to enjoy the big selling point of the store. But my friends enjoyed them and couldn't recommend them enough.
I like the vibe of the store, the decor, and the friendly staffs. I had the Coney Island Hotdog (Chilli Cheese Dog) with potato salad. I like how the chili and the potato salad are store made and not bought. You can taste the difference in flavor and in freshness.
Will definitely go back with other soda drinking friends."
acD0l-j5Kr-edoO-_tcbyg,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,5,"They have the best cat fish I have ever had (in phoenix area)!
The Crawfish etoffe was not as amazing but wasn't bad either.
My friend ordered the special of the day, ""Smothered Pork Chop,"" and couldn't be happier with his dinner! The portion was really good, and the fruit salad slightly warmed/sauteed with Bourbon gave fruit salad a new sensation.
I can't wait to visit this place again soon!"
vQq_sX0kSAUdT3yLW06q5A,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"This little place might not look much at the first glance. But, it's def not your usual butcher shop/ restaurant.
My friend and I shared the recommended ""Pork Wing"" and the ""Wild Mushroom Quesadia"". The dishes were presented nicely with side of radish/ onion/ carrots salad. A nuevo-fusion style of Mexican side, i would add. The pork wing idea was neat and the wild mushroom flavor was rather flavorful and not greasy.
The two of us just wished we had bigger stomach to try more items on the menu.
Can't wait to go back and try their pizza and tamale soon."
arFyWH26WkKjGEnh3FNXww,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"Alright, I might be biased.
But after my previous bad experience with another wing store, Wing Stop seem like the best thing anyone can have when craving wings.
Friendly service, decent price (compare to other store, but not compare to frozen wings), great flavor.
My first choice when it comes to wings!"
u6xb2aUAvX6i1WhsQWqgWg,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"Their cat fish and fried chicken was flavorful and tasty.
But my tiny bowl of collard green had enough salt for a dozen of Margarita at least.
I was not able to taste anything after a bit of collard green and was too full to eat anything else after drinking a bunch water.

Service was friendly though.

Will go back again when in mood for fried chicken or waffle. But will skip collard green and go with something else."
_DPJ_PHJnXsuhYhsgBA0Xw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"I didn't get the chance to learn more about Durant's before I went there with friends who said they heard good things about the place.

We were pleasantly surprised by the back kitchen door entrance and the old fashion decor.

Complimentary bread was a plus with amazing butter herb sauce. You can taste the basil, the leek, and the onion... with lots and lots of butter. It was delicious!

Between the four of us, we had NY steak, Filet Mignon, and Rib Eye steaks. As tasty as the quality of beef was, it wasn't the best I have had and wasn't worthy of the $50 dollars that I paid for.  (Thought their garlic mash potato was a must try!)

We were also surprised how my friend's median NY steak are just as raw as my rare Rib Eye. We weren't able to get our waitress' attention during most the meal though she walked by our table a few times. I think he would enjoy his meal a lot better if he could have his steak done right.

The booth are also definitely designed for skinny figure individuals... We were almost elbow to elbow with one another.

I wouldn't mind going back with other friends, but I probably won't try the place again on my own. As my three stars indicated, it really was just ""A-OK!"""
P2GBKrx7dJg3xeGtuU2K-A,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"I knew about this place for a long time and finally get to try it.

i went with friend for happy hour during week day. I was surprised how packed they were. Our waitress, who also happen to be the bar tender, was extremely nice and friendly.

Their dark and stormy and moscow mule was tasty and refreshing.

We ordered oyster on half shell and decided next time it can be skipped.

Their $5 fish taco was totally worth the buck.

Ahi slider was way too small for the price even as a slider. The fries on the side was prefect though. (I am a fries addict.) It was fried with great temperature, crispy and not greasy. Flavor was just right and not too salty.

My friend and I disagreed on the calamari. I think their batter for the calamari was perfect. It was crispy (not the scrapping your mouth kind) yet soft  with perfect flavoring. He thinks the calamari is missing a little texture.

Will go back for some more for sure!!!"
rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"Best Dim Sum In Town!!

I like the wide selections of dim sum they have. You can also tell they made most the dim sums freshly, not those bought frozen type of deal like some other places.

Sometimes, I would be surprised with new products/ unusual products they are serving. Last time I was there, I was offered ""thousand years old egg cake"". But, if you keep open mind, this is the best place for you to sample many different type of dishes affordably. .

Can't wait to bring some new friends there for some Dim Sum this weekend!"
0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"I love their Tuna Burger, asian slaw, and fried (fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings... etc etc) items. Oh, and their milkshake is also to die for.

I would go as often as I could as long as it's not over 90 degrees outside. I didn't enjoy the long wait to order in the heat. Service is really nice and pretty fast. I got my ordered messed up a couple times before, but they usually took care of that right away and always with an apology and a smile.

Looking forward to my next visit."
HGuHk935tyokX6kveEviJw,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,2,"Went there a few times for dim sum.

The dim sum price was cheaper compare to couple other places. But you pay for what you got. The dim sum quality really is disappointing. They have basic dim sum variety. But nothing special or delicious really stand out.

What kind of service you got for the visit also varies. We have experienced host arguing with manager, manager arguing with waiter, and waiter arguing with the host.

I think I would rather drive a bit further to go somewhere more consistent and tasted better in the future."
wyFV6UN--hH_ifbvdsjSkQ,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"The service was EXCELLENT! No doubt!! Our waiter and water boy was so attentive, kind, and knowledgeable for all our questions.

The price was fair for the quality of food they serve. I was not impressed by the Fleming potato, but LOVED the crab cake and my Bone In Rib Eye steak.

Only down fall would be the restaurant was rather loud on the night of our visit and I felt like I was at AppleBee's/ IHop and had to raise my voice periodically to be heard by my friend who was sitting next to me.

Over all happy with the place! Will go back for special occasion or good piece of steak for sure!!!"
szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"I didn't try the dim sum there but ordered from the regular menu.

Their roasted duck was fabulous, but everything else was just A-OK.

Will probably go there if I am close by, but won't make the drive all the way there just for the duck."
zPQesAWNB_FuL2Be1pPPlA,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"Their Chicken Noodle Soup and Asian Chicken Salad are my ultimate comfort food!

Have to say this location is one of the preferred ones now that Tempe location has changed into ""Field Kitchen.""

They pay close attention to their soup quality, and salad was great!

Will return soon!!"
Vw9u6qar1I2QlkQOV6KNVA,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"Been going there for a couple years now. I love the food, the decore, and the selection of the menu.
Their Siam Duck, Teriyaki Beef, Green papaya salad, beef salad, and fried banana are all my favorites just to name a few.
But I am having problem with the variation of the services I received there. They are mostly decent, but I had a very bad experience with one of the waitress when I visited last time. It was an early evening and we were the only one there when we first walked in. Two other groups came in after us shortly. While we were waiting to get our menu, the other two groups already got their drinks and placed their orders. We asked if we can be helped to place our order, we were neglected and ignored. I am not sure if it's language barrier problem, but it feels like she was yelling at us when we were wondering why we haven't been helped. We end up walking out there empty stomached.
Again, since I have been going there for so long and liked it so much, I don't want to give it a bad review. So I took two stars off the five stars that I would give them just for the food. Hope the services improve soon!"
59OgPGGzKFYqwSG_U06kuA,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,5,"The menu selection was fair and food was authentic.  Their price for Korean BBQ was cheap compare to other Korean BBQ restaurants. Service was good, they noticed and asked me if I want more free side dishes that came with the meal when they spotted my empty plate before I even have to ask.
It's my new favorite Korean restaurant for sure!!!"
9y1uLUHxZ3m_4KzydQj9YQ,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"I like their fries! I like their wings!!

C8D_GU9cDDjbOJfCaGXxDQ,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"Went there for happy hour during a week day. I like the relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Happy hour menu was a bit smaller than what I anticipated. But the amount of food we got and the quality of the food was fantastic.

Pretzel and Fondue was a okay. But the amount of pretzel rolls we got was totally worth the buck. Chips with onion dips was the best chips I have ever had. It was crispy, fresh, and non-greasy. It was refreshing to see how little oil was absorbed to the wax paper. Onion dip was not amazing but goes well with the chips. Grill cheese sliders was decent. But not amazing compare to the pretzel and the chips. The biggest disappointment would be the Korean Chicken and Shrimp. Portion was small, flavor was nothing Korean, and the presentation was just not appealing.

Over all we had a great time and will likely to return to try other regular menu items."

OtVNeY6IfUh3CIOCzmfg3A,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"Such a marvelous place! Sadly it won't be around for much longer. :-(

We went there for my wife's company Christmas Party and had just a wonderful experience.
Fire pits everywhere, super cool 1800s/1900s décor and some very good food. Words cannot really begin to describe this place! A must see in the Phoenix Area before it closes! I think I read it closes in March 2015. Someone mentioned that the original owners kids were selling it to a land developer. Such a shame. (Not sure about the truth behind that, but very believable)
I had a burger right off the grill, and it didn't disappoint. My wife really enjoyed her veggie burger. Sides were very good as well.
A few bars scattered around the property with lots of different beers and cocktails. They even had a nice live band playing. Sort of a Rockabilly sound to it."
HaOvuZUzCLbObQfT8H44fw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Fantastic place!
Great salsa bar, warm and crispy tortilla chips!
Friendly service!
Ordered 3 tacos. Shrimp, Carne Asada, Carnitas.
Delicious (from what I could tell) homemade corn tortillas packed with fresh ingredients and delicious meats! Lots of flavor, very good meat. The Carne Asada could've been just a bit better, but I am spoiled as hell by the Mexican Food all over the Valley! A place I will definitely go back to if I am that far West!"

4bfKtdnkkhq8qA21sjVXlg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,3,"Just not up to par for I want from a Mexican spot.
Better than Taco Bell or Chipotle? HELL YAH!
I went with 2 tacos, red pork and red beef. Went with the refried beans and rice on the side. It was OK. Tortillas weren't soft, meat was a bit chewy, but the fresh ingredients were very good.
Also order Chips and Queso, very basic and boring.
I'd probably go back b/c they're down the street from my office, but wouldn't go out of the way for it.
If you're all the way up north, strapped for time and want Mexican food....Its probably worth a shot. Just not very Legit in my book."
avKtXuzalCP_cVfrk-fLeQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"5 Star Dive bar is right! If you're into Karaoke, this is your new local spot for sure. Reasonable drink prices and they have my Hunting Video Game! 5blks from the new house! I'd go back!"
o5ftMib2dp12c2vqgA5LUg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"I have to say, same great food as the other location, but slightly better service.
Went with the Pulled Pork Sandwich again and it didn't disappoint. One small difference; They put the slaw on top of the sandwich!  Fries were very good as well. One day I will try some of their regular entrees instead of the sandwich. If you're craving BBQ Meat goodies, and are in the area, you won't be disappointed."

I went with a few friends for my 1st time around midnight on a Friday!
Music was very good, crowd seemed very cool, loved the indoor/outdoor setup, beers weren't insanely priced like Chicago Club type settings, Vibe was great. No cover charge.
A place I'd go back to until convinced otherwise.
Felt very comfortable with the age group there. Seemed like 20s and 30s."
ZMgBp4XmiEHYAuXKbe1hUw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"What can I say? I am happy with this place. This was actually my 2nd time there and it didn't disappoint. We sat at the bar during Happy Hour and had a beer. The bartender was great(I love how they all introduce themselves in Phoenix, unlike Chicago)Got a little hungry so we ordered the Calamari that we previously enjoyed and a Pint O' Fries($2 happy hour special) Came out hot and delicious. Love the sauce for the Calamari, its like a Spicy Mayo with chopped green onion! Last time we went there we had Fish and Chips and Calamari. Both were very good last time as well.
Not a place we will frequent much with so many new options in Phoenix, but really love their semi-outdoor bar area! Complete with misters and several TVs."
zLsgXEuw0jaiQgZmLWUtFA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"After having a very good experience there the other day I decided to give them a try for a quick breakfast. They serve breakfast from 11pm-11am! WIN right there!
It was barely 6am and again, friendly service!
I don't even remember the last time I ate fast food for breakfast.
I had a Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage Biscuit and a Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit. A bit of a wait which was fine because it was made to order for me. Came out hot and was pretty damn good! Hash Browns were a bit boring and simple, but still cooked well.
I can sum this up pretty easy now. THIS is what fast food was like everywhere 40-50yrs ago before Corporate America took over trying to pinch pennies and sacrificing quality. Probably not going to be going back for awhile because I generally don't eat like this, but great to know there is a pretty good 24HR option if I am hungry!
Give this place a try next time you're considering one of those BIG fast food joints for nasty breakfast! You won't be let down!"

Absolutely Amazing!!!! Potato-Pork-Cheese Heaven on Wheels! The Fries are as fresh as fresh could be! Perfect! BBQ Pork and Bacon delicious!
Gravy had great flavor! NOT too salty! And the Cheese spectacular!!! I'd say my friends from Canada would be proud of what you serve!!!

Go to this place! Everything is made with love! I walked in, and the owner was there and made my food to order.

I went with my wife to check it out. We didn't see any of the shows, or eat, but a very cool place nonetheless. They have some retired movie set fronts there, and its set up like an Old West Town.
A place we will go back to for some of the Western Shows and dinner.
I'd say a very cool place to take kids and out of town friends.
Parking is $5, entrance to the town is free.

A pretty Trendy place in Scottsdale with a very elaborate list of brews! We tried a flight and had a mixed drink. Service was a bit slow but the bartender was solo and quite busy. I wasn't really thrilled with anything on my flight, but that's not their fault. I am a bit picky when it comes to beer.
Would I go back? Maybe. Its pretty far from me, and there are just too many other choices.

WPUf-Eo6PHxDNqPygahiUA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Just a nice local bar and small music venue in one.
Awesome menu with many burgers to choose from. I opted for the Juan Pablo. Super juicy burger topped with a grilled Poblano pepper. Side of Jalapeno Chips.
They have a great beer selection that included inexpensive domestic cans all the way to craft beers.
Back room is a stage setup with pretty good sound for such a small venue. We went here to see my wife's co-workers band play(DeadSpawn) and stayed for another as well.
A place I'd go back to for some music, but a bit too far to just go for a beer. Stop by and check out their daily specials!"
NAigH4SqnuuQip8lekq7GQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Well, this is a nice little place.
I kept it simple and did a #1 which is an Italian Sub, I went with the Large and its HUGE! Meat freshly cut and piled on as well as the cheese. Very tasty to add. The toppings are very much like Subway, as well as the chip and drink selection. I spent a little over $10 for the Combo and have to say it was worth the extra $2 or so over Subway. Its close to my work, so I'd go back again. If ever faced with a choice in another area between Subway and Port O' Subs, I'd skip Subway and go here instead.
The higher quality meat was worth the extra $$. Subway meat always tastes like the plastic it comes in. This does not because its freshly sliced."
iUHz8jIWjkbx6pXsTUNIaw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,2,"Local dive bar that we didn't eat at. We were sent here by some neighbors as it was supposedly better than the 2 we mentioned to them. Small seating area, large bar area. Immediate turn-off was the 1/2 dozen kids running around and screaming, and playing Golden Tee. Just had a shot and a beer, and really wanted to leave because of the kids. Sure it was around 7 on a Saturday, but still......Don't like kids in a bar at all.
I guess the kick was when we got our check. 1 large KiltLifter and 2 shots of Fireball, almost $20. Seemed very high for the type of place it was considering it's definitely a few $ cheaper at our closer local spots. These are prices I'd expect from from a more trendy sports bar with a nicer feel."
yqqXDVl7ZJaiDDbuCFXqMg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"2 lunches here so far and very happy both times! Great service and very good food!
I have had the Brisket Sandwich both times, but with different sauce. Sweet Heat and Cajun BBQ! The only thing I can criticize a bit is the bun. I feel like they could use something a bit thicker to withstand the moist meat covered in BBQ sauce.
The Cole-Slaw is great too! A place I will go to more, and look forward to trying more of their menu. Very curious about their Fish and Burgers."
6tLL1P8k9drb7MJEVwmRhg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Yup!! Beer Drinkers Paradise! Their Bottle Selection is just mind blowing. If you can't find several beers you like you clearly don't like beer. They have some house brews as well. We tried their Belgian Strong Ale which was a delicious shocker, and I have had many in my day! A place we would definitely swing through if in the neighborhood.

Now, just a little warning and possibly suggestion to the owner/manager.
Now I understand the law about Firearms and Drinking 100%. I was in there for a beer and wouldn't carry my firearm in there anyway. But! If you're a Concealed Carry Permit Holder and go here for Food(maybe with a group of people who are there for beer), you're NOT allowed to carry your firearm in there as stated by a sign. Now the catch is the sign is NOT posted outside, rather inside once you walk in and next to the bar. You won't see the 1st sign when you walk in because its behind you and would probably NOT see it if you sat down at a table.
Just a friendly heads up!

East Coast Folks.......Stop reading this review right now.



If you're from Chicago, don't go here. Don't waste your time, you don't need to convince yourself that Chicago Pizza is better. I've tried East Coast Pizza several times now and its very clear they don't know what they're doing, and its not a personal stab at this particular place. Sorry to jump on the age old debate, but it is what it is. Chicago simply does it better. Razor Thin to 5lb Stuffed and everything in between.
Not a place THIS Chicagoan is going to go back to again for pizza, although I'd still like to try some of the other things on their menu as they looked very enticing. I will stick to my local Chicago Style Pizza Joint for a nice thin crust square cut pizza! :-)"
-yQHIYKXH3HAdhh1W52OMQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"What a nice little surprise in Downtown Phoenix! I stopped here on a whim for lunch, and didn't even check Yelp 1st! I know, quite unusual from me, so yes, I was a little nervous! haha
Small place with a full bar and huge beer list! Whats the story here? Gourmet-Simple Sausages! They have 3 types of Sausage(Beef Brat, Hot Beer Sausage, Chicken Sausage) served on a piece of Naan(Indian flatbread) They offer about 10 of their own creations as far as topping combos, but they also have a Build Your Own option with probably 25 different toppings to choose from.
I decided to go for their Special of the Day(Week maybe) which was Bleu Cheese, Bacon, Arugula. And chose the Hot Beer Sausage. It was delicious! Great flavor from the bacon and sausage, and the bleu cheese just brought it all together.
They also have another specialty here, Insane Donuts with a kiss of artistic flair!
I was so tempted by the dessert menu that I went for an Apple Fritter with caramel! It didn't disappoint at all!
While I was leaving, I noticed they also have a Food Truck! Actually, 2! One looked to be Donuts only and the other was much larger and seemed to be their Mobile Sausage Delivery Unit for the hungry people of Phoenix!
Check this place out if you want a modern twist on the age old Cased Meat!"
ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"Another great experience here. 2nd time there, I seriously can't see a reason why its not 5 stars.
Sunday Happy Hour all day! :)
Went back again, enjoyed an awesome HH Meal and Drinks!
Great Guacamole and their House Salsa was great too! Love their Chipotle Salsa!
This time, I went for the Pork Tacos on the HH menu! Delicious! Al Pastor is what they really are, and I love Pineapple Pork!!
Great service again, very attentive waiter."
2OKh-3ToognFAccCFAFJVg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Apparently this is NOW one of our local pubs! Sort of hidden in a strip mall. Its very large inside and had some nice sounding food special although we didn't eat.
Awesome 4 Peaks Kiltlifter on draft and $3.50 Fireball Fridays! Great service from the bartender, serving drinks with a smile!"
V9bs-9SqhlryOCLy6vk6gg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"Bleu Cheese Burger and In House Fresh Cut fries! Hands down the best Burger/Fry combo I have had in Phoenix!!!
Great bartender! Service with a smile! Definitely a great local pub I will be revisiting quite a bit!!!"
e-cxqDjKEHEcISP2iGcZxg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,2,"Just NOT my type of place. I went with a group of friends on a Saturday night around 8, and by 9 the place was packed.....With a very older crowd. At 38 I was probably in the bottom 10% of the age range, maybe 5%. Drinks were decent, but SUPER Expensive. Almost $15 for a martini.
By 10 the place was pounding pretty good, I have to say their sound/lighting system was pretty awesome. I just don't want to see women old enough to be my mom shaking their asses on the stage. If you're in the 40-60 range and looking for a solid place to party, and relive your 20s, THIS is probably your spot.....
Not trying to be rude to the older crowd, I think its damn cool that you still know how to party....I just don't want to be there while you are! And a friendly heads up to the 21-39 crowd to avoid this place, unless you're looking for love from an older guy/girl.
Really my 1st Club-Type(but not really a club) experience in Phoenix. It was a pleasant surprise that nobody was really being a drunken slob like so many club type environments in Chicagoland. I'm not sure if I can attribute that to the age group or Phoenix in general.
Either way, not a place I'd go to again......
Tip to Management/Owner.....Having grown up in the Chicagoland Club Scene in the 90s and 00s, if you're going to have a club environment, have room for people to dance. Ditch all the tables in the 1st room in lieu of a dance floor."
4aF5GfnVkJPj9IwJ2yxPtQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"I had forgotten how BOMB this place was! Right next to my new temporary place of business too!!!
Green Corn and Cream Cheese! And don't be scared away by the prices! They are twice the size of a typical tamale.....rolled in 2 corn husks instead of one! gasp emoticon"
6t7mlTVjDA9fhuFAZmVzAQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"It's Portillos! What can I say? Super reliable, very good food! Always been a fan of their burgers and fries.
For the locals here, give it a try. This is probably as close to Chicago Food as you can find here."
hiMdQmnVXgp7DTCCj3pwdA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"And folks, there you have it! A legit Chi-Town beef in the middle of the Desert!
When was the last time you had an awesome Italian Beef sandwich in February, and walked outside to high 70° temps?! Oh never?! That's because you've only had them in Chicago.
Bravo Joey's!
I typically prefer a fairly Dry Beef(Ordered Lil-Wet in Chicago) So I went for Dry here and also got a small cup of gravy/hot peppers on the side. Added just a little bit and it was exactly how I like it. Bread held together perfectly until the last bite!
If you're from Chicago and craving a Beef, not willing to settle for that Chicago place that opened here, GO OUT OF YOUR WAY to go to Joeys!
And for you Non-Chicagoans, if you want to see what the buzz is about with Chicago Style Italian Beef, this is your spot to go!"
k6pWX0v60LIRS2guzkpxqQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"I'm not going to be long winded on this one. My wife and I went for a Saturday Night Dinner Buffet and it didn't disappoint. Nutshell? It was exactly like the Sunday Brunch without the Eggs and Pancakes. Delicious Seafood and meat selections. King Crab Legs were great, Lobster claws hit the spot! Beware of the Crab Legs Frenzy! Apparently the idea of All You Can Eat Crab Legs turns people into crazed Zombies as they will become insane when the platters come out!
Get here early. At 430-5 there was a short line, by 6 it was insane! I can only imagine people waited probably an hour or more to get in there."
qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Very happy with our meal here! Sitting outside in December is a whole new world for us!
Walked in and immediately greeted by the hostess. Offered an outside table if we wanted which sounded like a great & different idea for us in December!
Chips and Salsa right away! Awesome Chips, Salsa was boring and not chunky like I prefer.
Awesome and helpful waitress that was very attentive, offered to explain the menu in full, but we pretty knew what we wanted!

Started off with a Happy Hour Dip Trio(Charro Beans, Queso, Guacamole) and I went for a $5 H-H Classic Margarita on the Rocks and my wife went for the $5 H-H Mixed Berry Margarita. We were even asked; Salt, Sugar, or Nothing on the Rim!
The Dip Trio was yummy, standout being the Guacamole. Super fresh! Beans were nice and creamy with tiny little pieces of bacon, Queso was a tasty addition as well.
Margaritas were great as well! Mine was just a perfect example of a Classic, wife's had a nice, but not overwhelming Berry Flavor!

We also ordered the Shrimp and Crab Ceviche which was very simple, yet divine. Most places simply over do the Citrus, not the case here. It was present, but didn't dominate the dish. Awesome shrimp and crab pieces in there!

Moving on to our actual meal. My wife went for the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos with black beans. Again, perfect Shrimp, nice flavor, awesome Tortillas!(More than likely homemade)

I went for some goodies from the H-H Menu; Beef Taco, Pork Taco, BBQ Pork Torta(Think Big Slider Size) Every thing was great as expected! BBQ Pork was tender with great BBQ flavor and a little heat. Beef and Pork Tacos shared the same tenderness with lots of flavor! $3 Happy Hour Tacos(BIG) and $4 Happy Hour Torta! M-F 4p-6p

As you can see, YES we ordered a lot of food! And pretty much ate it all short of some of the beans and chips! A place that we will definitely go back to in the future when we're in the mood for more of a sit-down type of Mexican Dinner!"
XWafv9_J7TUOO4PbEcIFJA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"This place took some guts to stop at, but it was well worth it. Small location that most people would just pass up for a fancier Taco-Shop! Super elaborate menu with options for everyone. I kept it simple with some beef, chicken, tongue tacos! The tortillas were a bit smaller and more doughy than I am used to, but were great. All the meats had great flavor. Not too salty, not too greasy....
My wife really enjoyed her Shrimp Cocktail! Step outside your comfort zone and give this place a try!

D42-sxkmZy2fn4BkZaEkbA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"How much or how little can I say??? Its In-N-Out!!! And we don't have them in Chicago.
#1 Animal Style really hit the spot after a long morning of travelling. Great cashier and quick service! It made me happy at 11am! :-)"
2skQeu3C36VCiB653MIfrw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Really had a great meal here!
We started the night with a couple of their in-house moonshines. Apple Pie and Blueberry! Both were delicious.
For food, they have tons of Smokey deliciousness going on.
It was Happy Hour so I went for one of each of their Tacos. Smoked Salmon, Steak, Pork Belly, Brisket. They were all very good, with focus on the Salmon and Pork Belly. My wife went for something we'd never seen before, Smoked Tofu. Texture was still nice and firm, and had a great smokey flavor.
The service was great, waiter really explained everything they had in detail. Definitely a place I'd go back to! Need to try more of their Smokey Goodness!!!"
UESdOMLsXn_7WcwOZt7I3A,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Great service, divey location, but I liked it.
Stopped for a couple beers and had a Meatloaf sandwich. It was pretty simple, but still good. Fries were a bit boring. I'd probably go back to try some of their traditional English Pub Food, just wasn't in the mood for experimenting last night."
F6Xyqyoi_RCTc3mf00ip2Q,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"Round 2 but happy hour this time  if youre serious about no frills and no trend sushi go here now or regret your existence!!! Another bomb.com experience here! Please go here now!!!!

_18eAwEHvc6RSa6MeynXag,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Going to start this one with 4 Stars because we only had Tapas and didn't have any of the delicious looking entrees.
We went there for Happy Hour on a Sunday. What time is Happy Hour on Sunday? How about this; ALL DAY 4-9p!!
Such a wonderful waitress that seemed thrilled to be working there and knew the menu in and out. Why? Well because she was Spanish. I haven't been to a Cuban Restaurant before and always assumed Cuban Food was Cuban Sandwiches, well that's Cuban Fast Food. Cuban Cuisine is more like Spanish Food with their own Island Twist! Also very similar to Puerto Rican Food with a slightly different twist as well.
Some awesome specials on food and drink. We kept it simple with a basic Mojito that was great!!! x3 :-P
We ordered some food from the Happy Hour Menu and some of their Tapas off the dinner menu.
I will list them out for ease of reading.
Seviche-Basic but good! Loaded with fresh fish and veggies!
Frituras de Camarones-Think Shrimp Cakes/Patties with a great sauce!
Calamari Frito-Calamari fried in Almond flour, crispy but not caked in batter, really the best Calamari I've ever had!
Croquetas de Pollo-Delicious crispy little chicken treats with an awesome sauce
Yuca Frita-Great little Yuca fries with another awesome sauce
Pastelito de Picadillo-Great little puff pastries filled with seasoned ground beef
Albondigas-Little tender balls of beef with an incredible brown gravy!
Repollo Relleno-Cabbage Leaves stuffed with Chicken and veggies covered in a creamy lime sauce!
Mojo de Ajo-Warm Garlicky lime and oil that is great for....Well, EVERYTHING to be dipped in! Great for bread dipping!

Just a fantastic experience for us since we loved Tapas Bars in Chicago and ate our way though Puerto Rico for a Week! We will definitely go back for a Full Dinner as our mouths were watering over their Seafood and Pork dishes! Semi-Local place with a nice Island feel as soon as you walk in the door. Also take a look at their schedule for music and dancing as they clearly like to party it up there and make you feel like you're 2000 miles from Phoenix! :-)
Great stuff! Thrilled we found this place. Strangely enough because we were sent to a dive bar next door and saw this and knew we needed to go back.
Take the previous LOW reviews with a grain of salt. I don't like to insult other people but I will guess they're just not up to speed on what Spanish and Island food are all about. This menu was put together like Pros!"
7dKIMvsTQI6zO-NYdRmrwA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"I will start by saying I have never been to the UK but I have had my fair share of Fish & Chips at several places.
Service was great, tried a couple beers and decided on the Speckled Hen on Nitro. Delicious brew(for a non-stout!)
Went for a basic Fish & Chips(small) and a Beef & Kidney Pie!
Took a little time to come out which is fine because I know it was made to order. Fish was simple, but not over-breaded or over-fried. Chips were great! Little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
The Beef & Kidney pie was yummy!!! Perfectly flaky crust and great flavor. BE CAREFUL!!!! This thing is hot!!!!! Cut it in 1/2 and leave it alone for at least 5-7min they bring it to you right out of the oven!
They have a very nice looking menu with several seafood and meat and even curry options. Super local to me, a place I will definitely go back to!
Friday/Saturday all you can eat Fish and Chips for $12.95 and Happy Hour  from 3p-6p with a nice discount on beers!"
CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Our 1st taste of Sushi in Phoenix and we were impressed. It was a lot busier and louder than our local sushi place in Chicago, but the food didn't disappoint. It was a bit pricier than we are used to, but the fish was super fresh and came out quick. The ordering process seemed a bit confusing but our waitress help us through it with a smile! I will definitely give it another try once we move there."
YSYDJTCt5kzY2kKnLNGRiA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,3,"Well, I sort of expected this from Scottsdale.....What can I say?
Very nice location with very nice outdoor area.
Greeted with smile, promptly seated, and immediate waiter contact.
Huge tortilla chips and salsa/black bean dip. Our waiter took his time and went over the menu with us.
We went for the Coconut Calamari as an appetizer. It was different, but different good, although we couldn't really taste coconut. Nice big crispy pieces with a creamy dipping sauce.
For entrees my wife went with the Hot & Spicy Ceviche. It was very nice and fresh, but still very simple. Served with sweet potato and beet chips, which were a bit salty.
I decided on a Shrimp Taco and Taco Vampiro as suggested by our waiter. They were pretty good, but I feel like the shrimp and the steak got lost in the mix of salsa, guacamole, and cheese. Just not what I am used to having eaten as some great Mexican Restaurants.
My wife ordered what was supposed to be a Pineapple-Serrano Margarita as we had a $5 off Coupon from our Yelp Check-In. It tasted like a simple Margarita. The Yelp deal is for a Don Julio Margarita which is some of the cheapest Tequila a bar will stock that isn't ""Well"" Tequila.  Our waiter said he'd see what he can do as this Margarita my wife wanted wasn't a Don Julio Margarita.
Now for the rough part! Not like the Cost was a mystery, but moreso a reminder of a mediocre meal that was pretty expensive.
Tacos were over $6(something I'd glady pay $3 for at a local taqueria)
Ceviche/Calamari, well seafood is expensive. I understand.
The Pineapple-Serrano Margarita? $11.50+$1.50=$13 for a small margarita that was nothing special at all. My wife asked about the Yelp deal, he said he forgot. She also mentioned that it didn't even taste like pineapple-Serrano. He came back and had removed $5 and the $1.50(fruit upcharge) so Ok, $6.50 wasn't bad.
Not a place I'd go back to, and if you're looking for great Mexican food there are 100s of other choices out there."
rMCKv9puuu2NkYISHnwyWg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Such a great little place. We can argue for days about Authentic or not....Who cares?
The Food is fresh and yummy! Not too much salt or grease and everything seems to be made to order.
I went for the Coastal Trio which was Fish Taco, Shrimp Taco, Tilapia Taco! All were great and loaded with fresh ingredients. If I had to nit-pick the tortilla could've been a little softer, but it held together great!
Salsa bar was amazing with something for everyone. I think 6-7 types to choose from.
This is a very nice place that I will certainly visit again!
If you like Seafood Tacos/Burritos, give this place a try. Don't let the Commercialized Type Presence scare you away, its very good food!"
T-KniGykrZ46ZC9plOTspw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Top Notch Mexican food right here! Thanks Yelpers! I went here because of the great reviews.
I don't even remember the last time I actually ate a burrito. I typically stay away from them because they're a sloppy mess that are difficult to eat, and not very enjoyable.
I decided to give one a try here. If there was a place to eat one, I guessed it would be a place named: PHX Burrito House.
I went for a Carnita Burrito with refried beans, and while I waited for it, I enjoyed the BEST tortilla chips I have had in Phoenix, and some of the best I have had in my life. Super fresh and crispy, not greasy, not over-salted. The Salsa was fantastic as well. Little chunky, little spicy, great flavor. I was also treated to a small bowl of the Famous Pork with Green Chiles. Super tender pork with a delicious green salsa.(They also have a burrito with this)
The burrito came out and it didn't disappoint! They don't try winning you over with an enormous burrito, they put all of their love into a medium sized perfectly rolled bundle of goodness with a nice firm tortilla. The Carnitas were great, rice was delicious, creamy refried beans. And how does one judge a burrito? Well, I cut it in half and each half held together until it was gone! Most places fall apart after a few bites!
Its a cruise for me, but a place I will definitely visit when in the area.
STOP going to those Chain-o-Berto type places and eat REAL Local Mexican Food instead!"
daLsASi-J8zee8cpZSnqjQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"24hr Quick Mexican food??? How can you go wrong?! Think out side the box and try something you haven't before. I went for the Arizona Burrito. It was well made, great tortilla and held together until the end. Right down the street from me, I will be back!!!"
LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Really another very good lunch! Tried the pizza this time  10"" Sausage-Onion-Pepper and I was impressed. Great crust and very good ingredients.  Much better than expected and I am a super critic with pizza due to my Chicago roots.
Service was great again! Love their outdoor area"
wltfqot_Et0r-DYaZDxWFA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Unsuspecting location right next to Dodeys Bar!
I popped in and grabbed their BBQ Pork Sandwich and I was thrilled! Great flavor and texture, the bun held together until the end! I am looking forward to trying some more of their BBQ in the future!"
DzVexh7EGld_2ziA1lRq9w,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,3,"I wanted a burger the other day, decided to finally give Smash Burger a try.
I went for the Arizona Big Burger. Guacamole, Jalapeno. Regular Smash Fries. Large drink. While the burger was nice and juicy, tasted very fresh.....I have to say the fries just weren't my style. Super thin and oily. I enjoyed the burger, but for the $12 I spent, there are just other places to go around here. While I didn't buy one, I have to say their Beer Prices were pretty ridiculous. $3.49 for a Can of Kilt-Lifter? $2.99 for a Can of Macro Domestic? C'mon. Then again I was in SnotsDale so I can't speak for the prices at other location.
Will I go back? Maybe. Next time I will skip the fries and enjoy a better than average burger."
825nC-s-cQG6Hsul5Gm2cA,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"Another fantastic meal here! This time I went for the Sampler and substituted Brisket for the Chicken, +$1.49(not a huge fan of chicken on the bone) Pork, and a smoked sausage.
Delicious! The Pork was better than last time, more juicy. The Smoked Sausage was one of the best pieces of sausage I have ever had. Great Smokey flavor and an awesome snap! The Brisket, well 1 piece was better than the other, but still great. I think the 1 piece was a bit of a burnt end, which I know some people love, but it was just a tad tougher and drier than the other. I am hooked on this place and have upgraded to 5 Stars. I think next on the list is to try their Ribs!
The only thing I can say about some of the previous bad reviews is they got a bad meal, it happens..."
I3STZd5iAvUL9MNLF_DUug,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Nice place for some pre-flight drinks! I can't speak for the food, but the menu looked very nice! The prices were very reasonable especially for an airport bar."
9vkVY5puIHRfKMgJB4LBnw,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,2,"Well, I am pretty annoyed, and I will spell it out so you can decide.
Location=Great!
Service=Great
Tried the Tatonka Imperial Stout and was very impressed. My wife and I also ordered 2 Shots of FireBall!
Ordered the Calamari and Ahi Tuna Poke appetizer. The Calamari was breaded perfectly, but was a bit chewy. The Ahi Tuna Poke was just ok. The Tuna's texture was a bit off. I also ordered a Black and Bleu Burger. Cooked a perfect Medium Rare and had some good flavor. Fries were nice and crispy.
The Food Prices were on par. $10 Appetizers and a $9 burger.
All in all, everything was very solid until...................
We got our check!!! $8.25 for 1 shot of FireBall!!! OMG!!!! Are you out of your mind??? By far the most expensive shot of Fireball I have ever had in my life! Seriously? FireBall is one of the least expensive non-well bottles at the bar.
My friend owns a bar, and said he pays $6/750ml for FireBall and I pay $19/1.75L at Costco. I completely understand making a profit, but this was just insane! Typically priced around $5-6/shot depending on where you go.
Not a place I will ever go again, and had I just stopped for a drink, I would've given them 1 Star, but the food was pretty good.
I never ask how much liquor is before I order, lesson learned :("
NUh5L9ZX-YrM5uAKhKQXoQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Nice environment with great service!
Order a burger and a beer....really enjoyed the tater tots and the burger was Solid!
Not much more I can say about this one. If you're in the area and want a cold beer and/or some food, give it a try! You won't be let-down!"
yUkOP3Tmdp1pWA7p3zHboQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Always have to check out a local brewery. While none of their beers really amazed me, the service and food did. I had a Kobe Burger, and while I still don't buy into the ""Ground"" Kobe hype, it was delicious. Their calamari was very solid!
Service was great start to finish!"
YtUaJkgKc1pucwdSq_DQeQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,3,"Just OK.
Went for lunch and decided to try one of their Lunch Specials.
Green Chile Beef Burro.
Their Chips are basic and a bit boring. Salsa was the same.
The Burro was a bit of a sloppy mess and lacked flavor. The Beans were soupy and rice was just decent.
Service was great. Not a place I'd go out of my way to go back to, but would consider giving it another try to see how they do on their other dishes. Nice little outdoor seating area."
ONyDFp4eO9T_igeM2wdiMQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,4,"Went back for another try.......
20% off Cheesesteak Sandwiches on Thursdays.
I went with the regular one, onions and mushrooms. It was very good. Tender thin steak, great bread, just the right amount of cheese, onions, mushrooms.
The Fries, well, better than most places but probably could've used another 30sec in the fryer to be a bit crispier. I also tried the Fried Zucchini, it was good, but very basic.
Great local place with good company and cold beer! I will swing by once in awhile!
Always great service and friendly staff! I just wish they had my favorite video game Big Buck Hunter :-)"
GUsYtGG557XKlHaMH87erg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,2,"You're joking right?
Went here for Taco Tuesday and I have to say; Worst Taco Tuesday EVER!!!
Don't be lured in by the $1.29 Tacos, go somewhere else.
The Chips were very basic, and the salsa bored me. My 3 Tacos came out and I didn't quite know what I was looking at.
Are they hard shell or soft shell? Why did they put lettuce and cheese on them?
The Shells were OK, but the meat was a poor attempt. The Shredded Beef was mushy, no flavor. Chicken texture was ok, but no flavor. Ground Beef? What is this stuff? Mushy as hell, no flavor at all....."
VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"Just a great experience!
I went here for some Good-Bye beers with my wife and parents on their last day in Phoenix. We went at about 6pm on a Sunday and were shocked by the Awesome Happy Hour Deals they had!!! $3 beer specials, $3 Fireball Shots, $0.99/6 wings, and they had a grill set up in the outdoor lounge area where they were serving up $1 Burgers, Dogs, Steak Tacos!
Our server Amethyst was great! So attentive, made sure we were never thirsty. My dad had a Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog and loved it! I went for the Steak Tacos that were hot off the grill and amazing. Seriously the best steak taco I have had in Phoenix! Simple and delicious made with great steak! Fresh toppings bar set up next to the grill. My Mom went for the BBQ Wings, and of course I stole a couple from her!
I can't speak for their Full Restaurant Menu packed with Meat Goodies, but after our great experience here we will for sure go back!
I personally can't wait to try the Smoked Prime Rib! I have never seen that done before, it has to be amazing!
Great job! Thanks for the awesome service Amethyst! I wish I had asked about your schedule as I'd like to go back when you're working!"
W36vefYka0IZAPWygxJtqg,8iKukfILG4ry2_iSNjT_cw,5,"Well, you guys did it now!!!!

My parents came to visit for the 1st time since we moved here from Chicago. We were supposed to go out to dinner last night, but they were tired from traveling and wanted a pizza. Now, my dad is late 60s and grew up on the South Side of Chicago and has lived on the North Side for almost 50yrs with local-family pizza joints EVERYWHERE. Contrary to popular belief, Chicago is NOT all about Deep Dish and Pan Pizza. A lot of us LOVE a proper, crispy, square cut thin crust. Not that floppy pie cut NY Style thin crust.
Having tried the regular crust a couple of times, I decided to give the Medium Crust a try with Sausage and Onion, and easy on the cheese(An owner favorite I might add)
Fantastic job! My dad and I were both impressed! ""Kid, you found yourself a great pizza joint out here"" were his words!
Whether you're from Chicagoland and craving a family style pizza joint that knows what they're doing, or just curious to try Chicago Style Thin Pizza, THIS is your Spot!
Quit messing with floppy NY Pizza and make the switch! You won't look back.....
Just a tip about Square Cut Pizza. We eat the outside crust pieces first, and work our way to the middle. The Middle pieces without a crust edge are the ideal pieces to have leftover the next day. COLD! We don't reheat pizza!!!

Bravo guys!!! The only thing my dad was missing were the crinkle cut fries and some garlic bread from his local Chicagoland Spot! No big deal, more room for pizza!!!"
ZP7U4qUCMjIvasWV7a_mgg,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,1,"I definitely agree with Amy A.'s review.

I came here tonight (a Tuesday evening around 5:00). I could count on my hand the number of other people in the place. There were two servers and one cook. The other people already had their food. We sat down and still waited 5-10 minutes before a server came and greeted us, asking what we'd like to drink. We each ordered a coffee and I a drink. Another 10 minutes go by before we get our coffee...but no water! She took our food order...pork chops for me and eggs for who I was with. Not a hard order. 30 minutes later they finally come back and my water is still no where to be seen (it came a couple minutes later).

The pork chops were rubbery and had nothing to them. It came with hashbrowns and salad from a bag. Her scrambled eggs weren't cooked all the way. When we asked for more coffee she didn't come back. We finally had enough and got up to go. Can you believe that the server had lost our ticket? So she made up some number and charged us.

Never coming back and this experience has put me off from any Waffle House. The place was unsanitary: flies, gross build up on the table edges, sticky floor, splotches on the tables, etc. You'd think this Waffle House in particular would look much better and have better service being so close to a decent hotel and sort of off the I-10. The location at Baseline and Priest is much better. They're normally packed but deliver impeccable service. Doesn't matter we're not going to any one of these places again. 1 star is too much."
MhnihE0alud0ereVInSt8Q,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,1,"Let me say first that I love Chinese food and its hard to not impress me. With that said, this place was gross.

I came in at lunch around 11:00am and was the only person in there. Their lunch menu has a lot but its strange: you get the main food, then you have to choose between a drink OR an egg roll OR a soup. Other places its usually all three for the lunch menu.

I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce and a large hot and sour soup because that's what I really came for and I can seriously put away Chinese food. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes so I'm starting to think that it will come out fresh and incredible. You can see where they're cooking...looks like they're hard at work back there.

The person who took my order at the register brings the soup first then the plate of food. I hadn't noticed until I got the food but they have buckets of silverware on the table. I wasn't sure if they were used or not, but they looked used. However there were so many on each table that certainly they all couldn't have been used. I was also kind of taken aback that they serve on styrofoam plates. No big deal just that I hadn't seen that in a long time.

I start eating the shrimp with garlic sauce. I quickly find that I don't detect any garcle whatsoever. Maybe because I love garlic and they only put enough in for a normal person. I don't know. I also soon find that it tastes like one of those microwaveable Chinese meals I could have gotten at the store a couple hundred feet away from their frozen section. Ah well, I eat it all anyway.

I get to the hot and sour soup: again, what I had really come for because I had been craving it for some time and has become my measuring stick for Chinese places. First slurp: no flavor. Nothing. Ok? I put some soy sauce. Kind of better. So I'm eating it, watching a little of their TV as I go when I noticed something strange. I don't know if it was uncooked egg or some sort of gellatanous goup but there was some clear junk in the soup. I already paid for it and I got the impression they wouldn't care if I told them, so I scoup it out and put on my plate. I continue eating the soup and find more and more. And what I think was chicken in there starts to resemble children's fingers that may have slipped in. This is no bueno!

Another thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool, but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.

I work around here and this could have been my go to place but I won't ever be coming back. It makes my stomach feel weird just thinking about what I ate. I hope I don't get sick later on.

Yes, it could have been a bad day for them. It was Friday maybe they were all excited, I don't know. But I'm not going to chance it."
IXUwuNjy707wJNW2U4sRVg,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,3,"Some of the food is good while others are just ok or not what you were thinking. Service was great. Seemed like after every sip of water someone was there to refill it.

It got off to a bad start when my fiance went to the restroom and said it was the worst one she had been in in a restaurant.

She ordered the chicken teriyake and it wasn't very good, it was lukewarm. I had intended to order sushi but I saw no sushi bar and there were no pictures that seemed to match what other people were having, so I went with something else. The service wasn't spectacular. The one and only guy in there yelled across the restaurant to see if we were ok more than once.

The table we were sat at was too close to other tables for that ""intimate"" feel. Our server was great, however. The food wasn't all that good. They bring you chips and salsa. The salsa, in my opinion wasn't that great.

Most likely won't be coming back as there are better options out there."

I gave it 3 stars because I've never been a fan of Indian food and considered it possible that I could change my ways after seeing the movie 'The Hundred Foot Journey', but alas I haven't changed. I would have given it 2 stars but that would have been rude.

The employees there are very impersonal. They would give you water then run away before you had a chance to say thank you, as if they're anti-social. So don't expect anything from them."
s3AG8m6Pzq-vON729pf0gw,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,2,"We moved to this area a little over 1 month ago and have been exploring our options. We wound up in this area and decided to try this out.

When entering the hostess lady looked incredibly bored and without a word guided us to our table, where she whispered that our server will be by shortly. About 5 minutes later the server came by and took our drink order, he came back with our drinks then disappeared for what seemed like 10-15 minutes. In that time we had been ready to order so what the heck?? And we were perhaps 1 of 5 other groups in here so it wasn't busy.

I had ordered spicy tuna and hot and sour soup. Who I was with order a steak with tempura and fried rice. One good thing about here is that if someone you're with doesn't like Asian style food then things like steak are available (this wasn't hibachi or anything, it was just a regular steak...although it was mentioned that it had a spice that couldn't be determined).

The spicy tuna roll wasn't all that great. I've been to less impressive looking places and have had amazing spicy tuna rolls for less. It was like they weren't really trying. The hot and sour soup was ok but overloaded with carrots. I tasted the steak it was decent.

It took a long time to get a refill on our drinks.

It took even longer for them to come by and hand us the check.

Have fun waiting if you go!"

JiNtFt02pLvjXkqxZL737Q,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,3,"This place was ok.

We were driving around trying to find a place to try in our new neighborhood and for some reason the building here sort of stood out. It didn't really...we were just hungry.

When you walk in, as the name suggests, you're overwhelmed with Iowa stuff which is interesting. To your right would be a bar (in terms of sitting at the bar to eat your meal) and a couple TVs). To your front and left is the seating which doesn't have any kind of privacy. You could be inches away from the table next to you.

Sitting there looking over the menu kind of reminded me of Joe Pesci from My Cousin Vinny when they ordered breakfast: ""we'll take two breakfasts"". There is plenty to choose from it just felt limited at the same time, if that makes sense.

The service was good.

The food itself was nothing to write home about. We'll only come back if we want that midwest/southern feel."
Jzz-ZLXsd2ClSn6UyFcbpw,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,3,"This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.

I've always had good service here."
TynJUYwpHgIjJqi4Xl8TyQ,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,4,"I guess you could say that service beats what the food actually tastes like to me. The food wasn't awesome in my opinion that other Yelpers have you suggest, but then again I've only had it once but will definitely try it again.

Walked in and was kind of taken aback at first. Its set up like Los Taquitos over in Ahwatukee: shotgun straight to the back where you order food, with sets of tables on either side. There's a bathroom, too. It didn't seem inviting but it works. You can either read a menu or they have pictures on the wall of everything you could order.

Its the owner who took our order and he was very friendly and professional. We sat down later and he brought us our drinks with chips and salsa. The salsa is on a little on the spicy side. Our food soon came and they're decent portions. He would frequently check up on us to make sure everything was ok.

One interesting thing was that an elderly lady and a little girl came in and just sat down. They didn't order anything. The owner asked them if they were ok and they said they were just waiting. A couple minutes later he brings them chips and salsa too. I felt that was nice of him even though they hadn't ordered anything (or hadn't yet at least).

This, for me, is another one of those places where I might go back if I happen to be there. I do recommend it to at least try once. I saw that they have pazole which I'll have to try some time."
Tl7V8AztDY8s6Jr8yJNKcw,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,4,"When I used to work in downtown Phoenix I'd come here for lunch if I hadn't brought mine. I'd always get the pasta special which comes with the pasta, soup, bread stick, and a drink. You can get a free refill.

A few times I got a breakfast burrito there and they're made to order. They were decent.

Its unfortunate that this is the only affordable place to eat anything in downtown Phoenix. Sometimes Sheriff Joe and his security team eat here if you'd like to catch a glimpse of him.

On rare occasions the owners are rude. But that's rare so maybe they were having a bad day."

qpBfYbkPmXIFWVQ7pLkQ_w,SlGjBJBnYAGJiOBqRiZv-A,4,"We came here on Father's Day. The food wasn't good at first because the noodles weren't cooked all the way! HOWEVER, our server and the manager more than made up for it. The manager had actually gone around earlier giving all the dad's a $10 gift card for next time. When our server mentioned to him our uncooked noodles, he came over with freshly made dishes we had ordered to go and a cake we didn't order to show his apologies. Great! A few minutes later, the waiter came by and explained that everything was taken care of and we didn't have to pay anything. Not for our drinks, not for the bread sticks, salad, my meal (which was different from the other three I was with and was actually fine)...nothing. I was taken aback because I wasn't expecting it to be free.

I don't condone complaining about a place after you've ordered but the noodles were uncooked in the chicken alfredo.

We'll be coming back because my fiance loves Olive Garden. I think they're all over priced and I personally feel I can make any of it much better and for cheaper, but hey she likes the bread sticks."

My chicken combo plate was great as always, staff and decor are both wins and the happy hour tapas were a nice pre-meal bite (two bites each, really). I second the other reviewer's mention on no place to put my purse at the high top tables. Also the location of their computers and the servers lined up creates a bottle neck trying to get to the front door/bathroom areas. A little design flaw in an otherwise spacious and stylish space."
QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,4,"Yes, hot tip you have to ask for the full menu. Second hot tip, learn to say ""hello"" in Mandarin (pronounced nee-how) and likely you won't HAVE to ask for the full menu.

We've dined here several times, and on Sunday, not surprisingly, we were the only non-Asian customers in the place. The chef was in rare form, and as I sit here having my third round of leftovers for lunch I'm still loving my dish. I opted for the Vinegar Fish, it's pretty simple -- whitefish, wood ear mushrooms and water chestnuts prepared with a dose of spice and rice wine vinegar. I'm guessing by the waitress' excitement when I ordered, that it's a dish they're pretty proud of. It was fabulous.

Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions, which I would classify as good, but not mind-blowing. We also partook of the Gai-choy which was cooked perfectly -- just the right amount of garlic and tenderness.

In the past I've really loved their Mapo Doufu (tofu), theirs is one of the best I've had anywhere. Next time I'm planning on having the Water-Boiled Eel. I heart eel, mmm.

Service is pretty barebones, so don't expect to be sucked-up to. It's perfunctory and efficient, the food comes up fast and they leave you alone. I can't complain about that one bit."
bKxKPGmkwH-Q-GSbt7chNA,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,3,"It was a Sunday night visit to Stingray. With a variety of sushi, drinks, blasting music and hipster decor, the place is designed to cater to the 21-35 set. And so it seems to be doing a great job of that -- the place was packed to the gills (no pun intended) with the typical Scottsdale club trash -- the finest sets of plastic tits and bleached teeth that daddy's money can buy.

Despite sitting squarely in their age demographic, the place was so not my speed. Although the sushi was good, and the sashimi very fresh, the place had all the ambiance of a high-school cafeteria. Imagine the cheerleader table after 5 appletinis, now multiply that by 10.

Perhaps a Tuesday night visit would be a bit more low key. Our dinner companion and I are willing to give it another go (I can overlook ambiance for good food). My boy, Epistoman, however would rather ram a chopstick into his eye than eat there again."

We've been frequenting The Vig since they opened, yet another destination spot in the neighborhood. Let me tell you how excited I am that their Central location is siphoning off some of the customers ... it's slightly less crazy up in there. Yes, I'm a curmudgeon, I admit it.

The Vig's food, though a little limited in options, is all fresh and satisfying. Sunday I had the grilled chicken sandwich with the mixed fries. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the veggies crisp and everything competently prepared. Big props especially for the $5 Bloody Marys ... it's what earned them that 4th full star. Just the right amount of spice and not too boozy.

We usually visit for dinner, and my husband was convinced they did brunch on Sundays. They do not. However, they did have one special ""breakfast"" sandwich, or you can get the burger with an egg on it for an a.m. protein fix."
e880MGw6C6PJL-n3EJoY_g,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,1,"Sure, their branding is nice. It has that feel of something hip and youthful, which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local. Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palate.

I can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's. Fresh vegetables, grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk. Instead, their food is BLAND. It is the inverse of food, it is anti-food, annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite."

Razz's catered my wedding, and even I, a devout omnivore, opted for the meatless dish. Three years later, people still talk about the food at our wedding."
RPO5ISR18Xllgk9ahdPepA,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,4,"A chef that can do great things with brussels sprouts always get major points with me, second only to one that can make creamy soups not laden with cream. Mark Tarbell does both exceptionally.

On our last visit, I broke tradition of ordering the special of the night and opted for the chicken. Yes, big deal one thinks ... think again. There is something magical in that bird, a perfect balance of salt and crispiness. When available, I go ga-ga for the lamb with brussels sprouts and french lentils. Another must is the duck confit appetizer. Heaven.

I typically don't bother with the pizza -- it is good, but not really an attraction. The by-the-glass list has several good selections, including a very well priced sparkling. The waitstaff is efficient, professional and friendly, something of a rarity even among many ""upper echelon"" establishments in the Valley.

The crowd is Phoenix ""diverse"" -- blue-collars and insurance sales types. Trucks and mid-luxury sedans dot the parking lot.

For pub fare, their food is quite good. The fish and chips are delightful, big pieces of fish fried puffy and brown. And the quesadilla is actually noteworthy, if not for the size, than for the chipotle sour cream served on the side.

The service has always been prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere convivial. All in all a good spot for lunch or an after-work drink."

Bacon wrapped hotdogs slathered with mayo and tied together with what has to be the most amazing ""bun"" I've ever had. I took mine with the beans and tomatoes, hold the onions, and slopped on as much of the green salsa as I could. The dog was gone in about 30 seconds. Good stuff."
vCD4a4nLeafjsNImVrCKXg,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,3,"Many of the options at Desert Ridge are lame, but we needed a place for a little pre-shoe-shopping pit stop.

I can't say I was overly impressed, however I credit San Felipe for turning me on to the ""skinny"" margarita. I ordered the South Beach TAN -- TAN must be some type of shorthand for FANTASTIC. Agave nectar, fresh lime juice and decent tequila -- I would say it was among the best margaritas I've had ever. It certainly blew doors off of my boy's standard marg, which was rather syrupy.

We ordered the chicken quesadilla which was pretty average; I give them points for not using liquid smoke on the chicken as so many mall-Mexican places seem want to do. Service was slow but friendly. It took a really long time to get our app. If we'd ordered a meal, we may have been there a while.

My annoyance with getting ignored by the server and a manager who came out to talk to our table about pricing problems, when all I wanted to do was order a drink, was palpable -- but seriously who wouldn't be annoyed.

Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker ""Modern Thai"" has become euphemism for ""Expensive Thai."" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce."
pBoWsom3mZFYo9EucIWRDg,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,2,"Warning number one: let me start this review by saying beware all those from the East side -- this is not the same as Kabuki in Tempe.

Our experience at Kabuki was disappointing to me, especially after I chose the restaurant based on Yelp reviews.

Seating was prompt and pleasant for our party of five. It was an early meal, and the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. Our waiter had his hands full, and, to his credit, we were a table of 3 sushi amateurs and 2 sushi snobs all vying for his attention. Despite this bonus credit, he was very ""first day on the job.""

We ordered a few apps, including the gyoza and misos. The gyoza was well received and the misos were standard issue.

Next on to the courses, the timing of which was horrible. We made it very clear to the waiter that two of us would be having sushi as our main, and the rest would be having entrees. Unfortunately, this was completely disregarded resulting in a gap so large that the person with the first entree served was nearly finished when the last entree arrived. Not sure if this was a wait staff or kitchen issue, either way it was problematic and a HUGE peeve of mine.

In the midst of all this the specialty rolls we ordered, the Hawaiian and the Caterpillar, were served -- along with the eel, salmon roe and tuna rolls. The straight sushi was very good -- the tuna was fresh, the roe not fishy. The eel was a bit drier than what I would prefer, but the flavor was spot on -- not cloyingly sweet or over sauced.

Unfortunately, the specialty rolls were so vile I actually had to be ""that"" person and send them back. It was a shame, as they looked stunning and were very generous portions. But ... this brings us to warning number two -- Crabmeat on their menu actually means Krab meat -- as in the imitation stuff, and not just in the California roll where we all expect it (and I can avoid it). It seems to make an appearance in ALL of their specialty rolls -- complete with mayo. Yuck.

Now, I realize every place has their own spin, but frankly I found the whole thing to be appalling -- I've never seen a Caterpillar roll that includes Krab. And the Hawaiian just made sense to have real crab, given the other ingredients.

The hostess or manager, not sure who she was but nonetheless lending a hand, was very gracious in accommodating a prompt removal of these sushi abortions and supplying additional tuna and spicy tuna rolls (which were both VERY good). I give major points to them for handling the situation well.

While I was very disappointed with my experience, it wasn't all bad. Had we not had the service issues, I likely would not have sent the sushi back, but by that point I was already getting a bit on edge. So, I won't trash the place, because god knows there aren't enough independents on that side of town, and the items done well -- particularly the spicy tuna and teriyaki  -- were very good. So my advice if you're not of the Krab loving persuasion -- stick to the basics, and you'll do alright."
IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,4,"I like Humble Pie. The ambiance is that trademark Arizona upscale/casual where wine swilling 40-somethings get can get a bit rowdy after a bottle or two. That's my code for don't expect a quiet dining experience, unless you go later in the evening.

The pizzas overall are quite good -- chewy crusts, balanced sauces and quality cheeses. I find the meat toppings to be a little hit or miss. It's hard to go wrong with the Schriner's Sausage, but I found the pepperoni to be a bit greasy and cut way too thick, and the prosciutto slices so large/stringy as to be a choking hazard. I refuse to use silverware to eat pizza, even in a classy pizza joint like this, so perhaps the Heimlich is in my future.

If you want to control costs, order one of their special pizzas (unless you like it super simple.) The pricing on their choose-your-own-topping pizzas can easily get out of control -- piecing together my favorite toppings resulted in a $16 pizza. Yikes!

Star-wise my review is somewhere between a 3 and 4. I'm giving Humble the bump for their Monday night half-price wine specials. The wine list has an excellent variety, and we've indulged in plenty of their top-tier bottles ... at 50 percent off, you'd be crazy not to."
3Hu-IPhq5I_jyb3YfeHpGQ,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,4,"I've been eating at this location pretty regularly since they opened it. What's not to like about Wildflower? The bread is terrific, I'm especially a fan of the $2 Dough to Go baguettes that blow doors off of anything from the other local bakeries.

While the bread itself is great, my passion is the Grilled Turkey Pastrami. The first time I ordered this sandwich, I almost sent it back not realizing it had the ""Wildflower Coleslaw,"" which just looked too busy for my palate. However, it turns out to be the secret ingredient, with its white raisins, cabbage, and jicama providing a sweet and crunchy texture to the perfectly seasoned turkey pastrami.

My favorite part of dining at Wildflower? It's a local company. Yes, it's all sexy and looks corporate like a Panera Bread or Paradise Bakery, but it's an AZ company that contributes to the community.

This place had a smallish, chill crowd with a relaxed vibe. I imagine when all the students get back, that could change. I thought the layout was nice, with a prominent bar smack in the center. Ordering drinks was easy and the bartenders were laid back. I'd definately give this place another visit."
lw5O3g9hl41l9fKLkmvJGA,6WfBop_XS1EgHU3F3ACqKA,2,"My client and I will occasionally loiter on the patio for afternoon meetings at Busters. The location is nice, it's a cute little spot next to the ""lake."" As I've never eaten in the restaurant, my review will only cover the patio and bar app menu. So in no particular order, my observations.

The patio needs more umbrellas, or perhaps a nice solar sail. Western exposure in the afternoon ... need I say more? The clientele around us was rather ... entertaining (yes, sorry I know that's snarky). It was an odd mix of bridge club and bar star.

The waitstaff is friendly enough, but during slow afternoon hours is busy with side work and tends to forget about you. I had to go inside to get my first drink since I missed her when everyone else ordered.

The beer selection is very good, but the food is pretty bland. My last visit we ordered the artichoke dip with chips. There were not enough chips to go around for three people, and the dip was rather mealy. I've had better dip from Costco.

I wouldn't go there on my on volition, but it's okay for a meeting."
I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,4,"I love this kind of snow shaved ice since I tried it oversea years ago.

I am glade to reunite with it again.

Tried the green tea flavor with almond pudding, boba, and black sesame glaze. Though they still put the glaze over the ice when I asked to have it on the side, it was not over powering or over sweet. Snow texture is right. Pudding is good. Boba was old, too sweet, and somehow stick together like an army instead of individual ball. They told me the price for just the ice without any topping or any glaze would be the same. Which is $7 for a large. I think it's kinda pricy for just plain plate of shaved ice.

Will go back for sure, just cause it's hot out there and that's one refreshing happy treat for me~"

They refund her the second charge and told her ""oh, and It will take 7 to 14 days for it to go through."" I am glade one of us was careful before signing her name!

Got twenty wings (ten bone-in and ten boneless) with four different flavors. I have to say, that's the worse wings I have ever had in my entire life. None of the four flavors had any taste. You can't distinguish one from the other. The total we paid for just the wings were $30. I had better, more flavorful, and way cheaper wings with Domino's. Common' guys. That's just disappointing.

qFo9G2zdvLbgH8whxty36g,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,1,"I went with my friend for his birthday. He ordered 12 oz New York and I ordered the 8 oz tenderloin. I knew what different cuts of meat look and taste like. I meant business when it comes to steak!!

Our cook prepped our food in front of us, I noticed how each steak has different cut, while NY was chunky and short, my tenderloin was thinner. While I turned around in middle of the conversation, the steak was served onto my plate, and the first thing I noticed was how chunky it was. After trying the first bite, I know immediately that was NOT a tenderloin. Just to make sure, I tried a piece of what was served to my friend, and I noticed my ""tenderloin"" was chewy and lean (what NY steak  normally taste like) while his ""NY steak"" was soft and fatty (what tenderloin normally taste like.)

I brought this to the manager's attention, he came over and looked at the meat and told me that my experience with tenderloin could be improved if I requested to have my steak cooked with Garlic butter. I informed the manager how each plate of steak tasted like and he insist that the fat/ garlic butter makes all the difference. (Keep in mind, my friend also didn't request the garlic butter.)

Lastly, he walked away with ""But I will see what I can do"" and never come back to the table again till everyone got their desert when they do the birthday picture for the table. I left my steak untouched simply cause I wasn't sure if they will correct my order... And end up leaving the place $40 short and hungry.

I feel I was treated like a restart and very disrespectfully.  I wasn't taken serious and my concerns were taken lightly. Though getting me what I ordered correctly would be nice (which didn't happen), an apology would be highly appreciated (which also didn't happen.)

As much as I love tepanyaki, I will NEVER return to this location."

My favorite, surprisingly, is the salty fish chicken fried rice. I don't normally order fried rice in restaurant and tend to go for authentic flavors. But, this fried rice is authentic and flavorful. Their hot pot dish with tofu and fish was also a must have!

I have not try it yet, but I heard you can also bring fresh seafood that you bought from the market (with recipe) to them. They will prep and cook the items for you with a small fee.

-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,3,"Had the Grande Mix Cocktail, Shrimp wrapped in Bacon, and the famous 7 Sea Soup.

One of the ingredient in the cocktail probably has seen its better days, cause it was unpleasantly fishy and bitter. Shrimp wrapped in Bacon (Shrimp Fantasia) was decent, but I had better at other places. 7 Sea soup was average, thought I think I will like it a lot more if the soup is served warmer than room temperature.

One last thing, Mexican cuisine usually pairs with tons of lime as garnish and flavoring especially when it comes to seafood. And almost all Mexican restaurants (or taco trucks) i been to seem to shared the talents of picking out the juiciest limes  that's ever grown. Well, not this place. One interesting I encountered today after decades of Mexican food experience was how dry their lime were. Most of them won't even budge one drop of juice for me. Wonder if that would make the difference for the cocktail or the soup?"

Food is quick, portion is generous, price is decent.

I will not order from their sushi menu, after all, it's a fast Chinese Food Restaurant. And whatever I had ordered were just sad looking. But their tofu dish with lo-men just can't be beat!

There are two servers in the place, the older lady was not as friendly and yelled at me and my co-workers once because we took 10 pairs of chopsticks and ordered only 9 entrees. (One of our co-worker wanted only egg-roll and soup for lunch and didn't order another entree.) The other times we were charged for sweet sour sauce for the egg-rolls that we ordered. (Which most place would provide when you order egg-roll.)

Over all, good get away dining place during lunch break, but won't go there if I have more time or options."
ynYEgNimJOyb8dvyr9x0sA,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,2,"I saw the review of this place and decided to give it a try with some high hope/ expectation. I was very disappointed.

My date and I both decided to try the savory crepes and shared Nordique (Smoke Salmon) and Mediterranie (Scallop). Well, for $13.95, the three tiny, over cooked, flavor less, and dry scallop really didn't comfort my taste bud or stomach. The Smoke salmon should just be renamed to dried salmon cause there's no smoke flavor or salmon taste to it.

We also shared their ""House Made Waffle Fries"" and recommended Ratatouille. Gosh, were we sorry. The fries, though pretty in shape, was heavily seasoned and soaked in grease. Ratatouille was salty and the flavor of the veggies didn't come alone together like they should. It's almost like they just whip it together at the last min.

La Chalet makes eating their sides chore like for us.

Best thing of this entire experience would be the sugar crepe. That was simple and delicious. The crepe has good texture, the flavor was light and just right, i tasted happiness in that crepe. If it weren't for the burnt cheese smell in the restaurant, we would have order another one.

Not sure if I will ever go back again unless I am in the mood for sweet crepe... but, nah, still not worth the drive."

I Was Wrong!

The Chinese food they offer had really authentic flavor, and the Mexican food they offer is just delicious. When you combine the two together... I can only say whoever came up with the idea was a GENIUS!

Price was good, only problem I have, which really shouldn't be a problem, was that the portion was too big. I felt all the beans, rices, meats, and greases may shorten my trying to be healthy life.

Is it worth it though? Yes! Totally!!"

You can see them making noodles right in front of your eyes, though I have been there many times, I am fascinated every time I see the chef making a piece of dough into a bowl of yumminess . And the big clear window also help you see what's going on in the kitchen, so no worry about what's really going on during preparation.

Price is fair, flavor is good, but personal preference can be twicked with the provided condiment.

You can also choose what type of noodle you would like and have different sizes and shapes to choose from.

Service was nice and quick. I ordered Cali Burger and was shocked by how good it was. The burger was juicy and moist, but not fatty or greasy. The bacon was crispy but not overwhelming. Avocado was fresh and green. The bun was toasted just right.

Cappuccino was decent, I just wish my hot cappuccino was actually hot and not cooler than lukewarm like it has been sitting there for a while.
I will give it another try (and stay away from the Pesto next time) and see if maybe it's an actual hidden gem or it's just over rated mistake."

The place was a cute surprise. The atmosphere was trendy and modern. Service was great with good menu selection. I couldn't make up my mind on what to eat and went with the daily special, Prime Rib Sandwich.

Meat was tender and the bread was amazing. As picky as I am with Fries, they were delicious!

The three of us liked our food so much, we decided to shared a creme brulee after meal. To our surprise, that was a big disappointment. The sugar was cold and chewy. Tough to eat with funny after taste.

Still would love to go back and visit, just probably will skip desert next time."

Tiny portion and not even hand rolled like it used to be. (Sushi doesn't taste the same if it's molded). I asked if it has changed the owner and got the positive response. I informed the waitress that the food taste different and was disappointed. She insisted the chef and the staff are the same. Well, it sure doesn't taste like it!! Raman was over cooked, instant noodle would taste better and cheaper. Tempura was oily and soggy (temperature issue when fried), sashiime was 3 piece of lumpy fish that I didn't even know it was sashime. Btw, I just read someone's review about their sashime being FROZEN, i had the opposite problem, mine was warm. What kind of sashime is served warm?!

My friends seem to like viet coffee very much as well.

Too bad they are not doing the little cake any more and the place (at this location) seem to be dying down compare to when they first open.

Don't like the new close earlier hours either. Wish they would open way after 8. When they used to close at 9, I thought they were closing too early already.

Hope they do something different about the store and boost the business again, don't want to see it disappear from AZ."

I like the menu selection and the New Asian Fusion type of creativity.
The Asian Tapa little bistro is also a great sale point.

I ordered the regular soft shell crab salad and the seasonal special fried squash blossom. They were decent, but not what I paid for decent. My friend had some short rib dish, which was suppose to have a great flavor with combination of  spiced daikon, egg sauce, and grilled bok choy as sauce.

cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg,GVIpmH7bkPFcu8a3VXt3xA,5,"I am struggling if I should give this place an honest review. It's a small authentic restaurant that's already getting too much business and unless you really are a foodie and appreciate authentic Chinese Comfort food, you won't appreciate the preciousness of the place. Don't come here expecting Sweet Sour Pork or any of those non-sense. Come for their handmade specialties.

I have a few must haves whenever I go to Chou's Kitchen. Their dumplings, chive box, and beef pie are to die for. Be extremely careful when you bite into the beef pie though. The skillful food maker was able to pack all the juiciness of the stuffing into the thin layer of dough before it's pan fried into perfection. They also made their dough for the dumplings from scratch, unlike most the store bought dumpling skins, you can taste the freshness in the mouth. If you are lucky, you may even get to see the cook making dumplings/ pies/ green onion pancakes right in front of your eyes.

Again, don't go there expecting Sweet Sour Pork or Chop Suy! It's an authentic Chinese restaurant. Go there if you have open mind and are ready to know what real Chinese comfort food taste like!"

It tasted nothing like spicy ketchup as mentioned in earlier yelp review for sure. (I heard they change owner in August, maybe the recipe changed as well?) But I definitely had better pico de gallo.

My Beef Picado was tender though I had to add a lot more salt to it, and my friend enjoyed her carne asada. ""It's good, just a little chewy.""

I will not drive all the way to that side of town just for dinner, but it's a pleasant place to meet up and hang out with friends."

Aside from unhappy waitress, their oyster on half shell was amazing. You can taste the ocean in your mouth. Crab cake was full of lumpy fresh crabs. Shrimp salad was not as amazing as described in the menu. Almost feel ripped off for the $14 shrimp salad with just two shrimps (and they weren't jumbo shrimp or anything...).

Though all items were happy hour menu, but our oyster, crab cake, and shrimp salad with one drink cost us $80 before tips.

Their corn bread was delicious. Rotisserie chicken was more like chicken jerky. But Ribs were to die for. Brisket was moist and flavorful. Best side dish tonight would be Mac n' Cheese.

Won't recommend their drinks though. Lemonade was disappointing, Sangaria was watery, and Appletini had no flavor.

Over all, I will visit again, and will be smarter with what I order next time."

I guess it would be a good hang out place after that or biking, boating, etc.

The appetizers weren't anything to get excited over - typical fried bar food.

The fired chicken only comes as a whole chicken. I didn't try it but it got an ""ok"" rating. I got the tijuana torpedo burger - that's right...2/3 pound of burger, with cheese and green chilies shoved inside and cooked. It was sight to behold sitting there on the plate but my mouth was not so impressed. It was decent.

We got the apple and strawberry shortcake deserts. Both were the highlight of lunch I thought. I loved the apples with the cinnamon and sugar topping."

I'm giving it 3 stars for the shear reason that the macaroni and cheese was such a spectacular gem in the meal experience.
The service was atrocious, they forgot that it was a birthday dinner and we sat next to loud family with 3-4 texting teens (oh yes, there ARE a few signs around that say no cell phone use but apparently they don't apply to this table).
The spicy calamari and tuna carpaccio on watermelon  were delish to start. Thank goodness as they seemed to be out of everything from the bar and never came back in time for me to order a glass of wine.
Looking dapper in linen pants, my date had the filet which was amazing. My scallops and sweet pea risotto were ok...have had better scallops but it was a good dish.
Desert was merely ""eh"" so don't save room - lick the mac-n-cheese bowl and don't expect a second cup of coffee unless you have a flare gun or send out an expedition party.

Atmosphere is very ""cafe-like"" and wasn't busy when I arrived. The first good sign was the aroma in my car which just got better after I began unboxing on the counter. I have never had such a large portion of papaya salad - amazingly fresh and light but could have been a tad spicer (thank goodness it wasn't though). The pad se eew, a good Thai litmus test,  was good (my kitten really liked it)  but not phenomenal - had the dark sweet sauce and not too much of the wok char flavor. But the panang...oh snap! Dizzyingly spicey for medium (I think they toyed with me)  but absolute curry-citrus-coconut milky perfection with a good amount of white meat chicken. Hooray for leftovers and a second fab Thai restaurant within 5 minutes of my house!"

Nothing is better than finding  a great Thai place and boy have I been blessed in Phoenix.

The ""Pad Cee Eew"" (spelled a million different ways) was good. I choice tofu - lots of little pieces, chopped chinese broccoli, lots of egg...the noodles broke up a little too smal for my liking. It had a great fresh taste, though a few bites were a litle too wok-smokey for my taste. The sauce was good but not as savory and rich as I have found at Pink Pepper and Thai-Rama  - though still very enjoyable. I had crazy insane hunger so went ninja with the chopsticks and ate the entire plate.

My dinner partner had the beef drunken noodles - loads of food and very tasty. The thai tea totaly ruled, the service was great , and other than the odd diner 60's diner feel and homeless folks at the nearby gasstation that might cause some to gasp in horror, the place was great.

We were seated and ordered a $170 bottle of wine - it took 20 minutes for the server to come back and we didn't even get water in the meantime. I actually had to get up and find someone to pour us water.
It apprently helps to be friends with or share pictures of your kids with the server to get assistance. I almost had a pitcher of ice in my lap while the table next to us had their water poured with a napkin as a splash guard.
The tomato/fresh mozzarella salad was sad...I would imagine better in a high school cafeteria. The tomatoes were white, not ripe and the balsamic dressing average. The 2 bright spots:  1)  the BBQ shrimp, though under cooked a bit, the fresh basil was a great burst of flavor combo with the BBQ sauce, 2) the grilled asparagus with balsamic reduction (sauce is not mentioned). The sides are not the portions you would anticipate - true servings for 2-3, a couple of bites for 4, and I really mean bites not heaping spoonfulls. The crab mac & cheese was decent for flavor but left both crab and cheese to be desired.
The plates weren't hot, my medium-rare filet was barely warm and chewy with so-so flavor and cooked unevenly. My brother's porterhouse came rare not med-rare and was sent back. After 10 minutes we had to ask where it was (something about we all have pagers and they will let us know - but apparently there was a pager failure). It wasn't even worth trying desert the disappointment was too much to bear....I was embarassed to bring to my family here and pay so much for so little.
For a place that boasts they ""eat, breathe and sleep""  meat I would suggest that they go back to bed and you spend your money at any Mastro's, Capital Grill,  or even The Keg."

It could be more comfortable by adding more power plugs extensions and sun shades as  drapes doesn't really help with sun glare as thoroughly as it should.

Cashier/barista (in training, I'm guessing) had her eyes glued on her cellphone,  took her co-worker to call her to help me out.
I witnessed a customer ordered sandwich to the other cashier, it was forgotten to be made.
Drink was good and be made excellent if it were less watery (forgiven, as she's still in training).

Will still comeback, as the people are nice and it isn't too loud."

My friends and I came here to try out the recently open establishment by their house.
We got Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken, House Yakisoba and Hot Night Roll.
They are all surprisingly REALLY GOOD and pocket friendly!

Hot Night Roll
Okay must NOT skip their sushi/sashimi/roll selections.
This, I must say, surpassed my expectation on small establishment with lower pricing point.
They actually used high quality seafood and slight sauce. I was expecting the otherwise as it would've been the normal for a cheaper Rolls. I would've ordered more had I knew.

The Pot Stickers
Crispy on the outside moist on the inside, try to dip the pot sticker in chili oil sauce AFTER you dip it in its sauce.

Orange Chicken
These days every other asian restaurant carries orange chicken, a few got it right on all three ingredients like this guys.
Sauce: Tangy with medium hint of orange and not too sweet
Breading: Crispy but it is ever-slightly present that I'm happily report that it doesn't feel like you are eating Colonel Sander's Original Crispy Recipe.
Chicken: Tender and Succulent, cooked just enough time. You guys, it is rare to find non overcooked orange chicken.

House Yakisoba
The portion is generous, and they tasted delish."
7m1Oa1VYV98UUuo_6i0EZg,69GPwit9GNmMjSqzjm6HQQ,5,"We tried their french toast fries, and their special burger of crabcake burger, sweet potato tatter fries, and their regular fries.


First of, customer service was wonderful. That's where the extra 2 stars comes from.

Burger patties was perfect. French toast is good, tatter fries is good.

The only let down was their burger crab cake. Although it has great quarter pounder burger patties, while combined together, the whole thing tasted like it was made by a cook than a chef. It was a great concept: the white sauce was a creative creation that sounds good on their chalk board but the way they made, unfortunately doesn't live up to the expectation; it was just bland. Crab cake was over fried, and bland too. Bun was not moist on the inside and savory on the outside, like the way it looks.

M2OC248gnU3FXJYcYsuZqQ,69GPwit9GNmMjSqzjm6HQQ,3,"So I was ready for my morning coffee and bagel...
Unbeknown to me, I stepped into not your average donut store...
It was pretty cool to see the store layout and the Gizillion Glazes and Trillion Toppings u could pick from.
I had maple glaze w bacon topping.
Taste:

Donut: OK, not bad but not one of the best...

Glaze: pretty good too bad it's too runny my bacon DIDNT STICK (by the time it's about 2.5978 inches from my mouth 70% of the bacon already fell off, by my second bite 98.76536% of the bacon fell- I Cry!)

Topping: bacon is always good!!!' :)

Iced coffee-light blend: umm if the standard for good are peets coffee and dutch coffee  then this is an OK, a tad too sour for me.

Conclusion: will be back to show out of towners crazy things u could find in AZ."

But they fell short on my iced mocha.
We ordered a regular mocha and an iced mocha. The regular one tasted delish, but my iced mocha is watery. I expected a better result from a coffee shop like this.
The place is cute, and while they have some comfy couches, some of their bench/chairs aren't."
v0YATh4rCiPlBpSyNmh3tQ,69GPwit9GNmMjSqzjm6HQQ,3,"They used shredded pork instead of sliced pork. I wasn't paying attention since I never ever ever everrr had shredded pork on any ramen I tried both in LA and AZ.
It is bad bad idea because all the juices soaked in the shredded pork interfere with the flavoring. Whatever spices that they added on the soup wasn't able to penetrate the shredded pork, as result the ramen soup tasted like ramen soup mixed with pure salted pork broth. I know ramen broth is made out of pork but what I'm trying to point out is that it's the mix of pork broth and whatever magical seasonings they added in to that pork broth that make it Ramen Soup. So by adding shredded pork soaked in unseasoned pork broth is like diluting the soup.
I will come back but I will not order the meat everrr....

I was going to just hangout at Denny's or McDonald to finished up my paperwork, but my best friend thought I deserve better, so she yelped for a nicer cafe for me. Being in Chandler,AZ. , most places closed down by 9pm, but...
she found this! THIS gem!

I ordered their special for under $8,
I got the cheese omelette, bagel n cream cheese and out of the world orange blossom crepe. If you like your dessert sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this crepe is perfect!

I got their pies to go, not revealing the flavor, because I wan't to make sure they won't run out on me on my next late nite rendezvous *evil smirk*
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS
If you are full before you eat the pie, you must, YOU MUST!!!, get their pie to go, otherwise you will regret it for the rest of your life; well not really, just until your next visit.

Also, they serve your drink in real glass, That in itself deserve an extra half stars on top of the six stars I intended to give them.

THE BEST Shepherd's Pie any muggle ever made, it puts your Granny's great great grandmother's recipe to shame, just kidding!
I'm sure she's a great cook :)

But, back to the Pie...
You could taste the fragrant butter on every flake and every bite,  definitely quality butter. Filling was perfectly baked, juicy and fresh.

About the service,
Staff was way more than friendly; when was the last time you eat at an establishment and given real heavy weight silverware and shiny ceramic plates sans scratches either from wears or being in dishwasher too many time?

About mom n popping,
( I totally just made up that phrase)
The owner is super attentive, kind and friendly, all the more reason you should go and visit this place!

Last but not least,
They use filtered water for their drinks, served it in thick Mason jars, no less.

To me, these say they are clean, they care about their pies, and clients.

Mmmm...
So why are you still reading this, muggles? Go get yourself a pie already!!!"
cs1qJvnWUg_f8g020z_3PQ,7hY4KYEf_NGSEaieUSQMvw,3,"I have heard allot of hype about this place, so wanted to check it out. I went on a Tuesday at 6 PM and there was not a wait, which is nice because I was told that people can wait hours to eat here. The main reason I came is because I was told the Caprese sandwich was good. I was sad to see it was not on the menu.... They stop making sandwiches at 4pm, so was a little disappointed I couldn't try it and they couldn't make an exception to make it. I understand that they couldn't but I still had to ask!! A girls gotta try! I ordered the margarita pizza and it comes with 6 slices. I will say the flavor was very good, but at the same time I've had many good wood fired margarita pizzas that were similar. I shared this with one other person and unfortunately the three slices did not fill me up because they were so thin and not a lot of toppings. I may go back to try the sandwich during the day, but for a $15 pizza that didn't fill me up or blow me away, I will not go out of my way to come here for pizza."

Chicken fried chicken was pretty good. I would make a reservation if coming, it's a busy restaurant."

They also use locally grown and some organic items. The pancakes are delicious, with a pleasant, light taste of lemon in the batter. My omelet was $10.95 BUT came with 2 sides (I chose home fries and pancakes), so there is plenty of yummy food for the price. It's a must try!"

Horrible girl behind the counter could not have been less friendly. Mexican guy wearing an Italia shirt refused to say hello.

Slices are now quite tiny and far from as flavorful as they used to be. The crust is still some of the best in town but unfortunately everything else fails.

Oh well I guess."

The bad:

egg rolls are frozen crap you get at many Chinese restaurants.

They charge for brown rice

They charge for hot tea if you dine in.

They can't cook spicy no matter how spicy you ask for it.

Heavy heavy vegetables. This helps make the food look bigger I guess.

The GOOD:

Sweet n Sour pork is excellent

Egg foo young is great

Teriyaki chicken is great

Bottom line this is a very average Chinese place. Nothing special."
I-VD-o4JDGSG5GHQ2EbrVA,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,3,"Seriously average. Waited in line a good 15 mins. Then another 15 for our burgers.

The food here is awful. They have 1 dish that is good, the Tempura Shrimp. Other than that. Pretty bad. Including the Sushi."
x7CKTMiFrfGA1yCpe8_xQQ,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,2,"Went here 3 times before posting this review as my first trip there was quite bad. Half of our pizza was very thick and doughy, the other half was nice and thin but had little cheese.


This place is owned by the Hungry Howies owners across the street. So don't expect anything mind blowing. They are a chain out of Casa Grande.

That being said. It's probably some of the better pizza around if you order your Pizza EXTRA thin and ask for someone to make your pizza that knows how to do it. This place seems to be full of trainees everytime we have been in.

Judging by the name you would expect a neighborhood joint with a big Italian guy named GENO making your pie. This will not be the case. As a matter of fact you probably won't find any italians within a mile of here. It's Gilbert Arizona! The staff is friendly but not very personable in the least bit. You will have no conversation here and you won't be making any pals with the ""guys over at the pizza joint"". It's mostly 17yr old Mormon girls from what I can tell.

I think once this place understands how to proof thier dough correctly and make a good crust they will have a really decent quality product on their hands. At this point, its just too inconsistent and their crust will either taste like something decent or like the pizza was made on Bisquick. My best advice thusfar is try a slice as it seems to be much better than their whole pie.

Hope to come and edit this review down the road once things get a little more consistent. I will definately be eating there again as this place is literally 1 block from my house.

PS: NO BEER."
0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,3,"Went there again the other day to try the Tuna that I saw on Guy Fieris diners drive ins and dives.

It was horribly overcooked and tasteless. We also ordered a burger with I believe Fontina. Terrible and hard as a rock.

I think it might have been because they were so busy but I had to change my review because anytime you spend $25 on a meal you should not have to be eating dry or overcooked food!"
L23qeWacyCZFjF9DL6o04w,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,3,"This is very good pizza for Arizona. I live off of Pecos so I stop in here for a slice regularly. Good specials around $5.

However if i want real NY pizza I head up the road to Nicantonis where it's not chain and he uses better ingredients and the pizza is the best in the Valley.

Keep in mind Venezias is a chain out of New Mexico i believe."
udrIB4tIAtZQOGAiukQ2Rg,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,2,i think this place is really overrated. the menu is extremely limited and small. it has to be the smallest menu of any fast food place. the food is fairly boring. their buger tastes very similar to a whopper but is much smaller. prices are a little high for what you get. just ok place.
YM-nYIHd99qUt9n62AxIAg,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,5,"this is a great mexican restaurant. i've been going to carlos obriens since 1985. the portions are large and oozing with cheese and sauce. i don't eat rice or beans and with the large enchiladas and tacos, you don't need them. you can easily fill up with just the enchiladas & tacos. everything has alot of cheese and sauce, covering the whole plate. the chimi's are huge. fantastic chips. they do have a nice bar with plasmas and you get free chips and salsa  whether you're there to dine or drink. the service has always been good. this is a large, good restaurant. they do have a happy hour in the bar. you can call ahead and order food and they give you plenty of sauces with your to go order."
thlAnPN1ApoNxSnok_fcvA,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"ok. i'm a fan of the food and decor, but if you're in a rush, this isn't the place for you. i've been here for breakfast a few times. the food is always very good with large portions. you are paying for those portions though. my chicken fried steak breakfast is $10.00 .  so if you're looking for a cheap diner, this isn't it.  you can get a breakfast buffet for this price at other places as well. anyway, the quality is good and it's loaded with cute country bear decor. however, it's always super slow to get our food. it's almost always very busy as well. there are breakfasts under $10.00. on average, probably $8 or so. they have a simple lunch menu of sandwiches and burgers. their dinner menu is VERY limited. they have a steak, chicken, and ribs dinner. they are all $15.00. thats about it. so, good on quality. good on portions. a little higher in price. bad if you are looking for something quick. give yourself atleast 1 hour after you sit down."
IyVdd_IqwUtzQDTxw2W9qw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,5,"By far, one of the best places to go during happy hour, Mon-Fri. 4-6:30. All drinks & all appetizers are 1/2 off. All. The food is great. They have a very large appetizer menu. My favorites on the appetizer menu are the wings (big) $5 during happy hour, ribs (fall of the bone - great flavor) with sweet potato fries or regular fries $6.50 on happy hour, or my favorite of all, The Monster Platter. Huge!! $11 on happy hour. The Monster Platter has wings, ribs, sliders, sweet potato fries, and onion rings!!! It's a must buy! You also get free food before your order comes out, and after you're done. I can't say what it is and spoil it.

They also have a regular priced menu full of all types of food. Average cost is $9 for a big burger, or sandwich. They have full dinners as well.

Drinks - All half off. All good. Only thing not half off are bottles of wine. Bottled beer is $2.50 to give you an idea.

The atmosphere is very cool. Nothing like it around. It's a 2 story western looking saloon with actual & real farming tools, and other western decor hanging all over the walls. There's a mecanical bull. This is not a country bar, though. All the decor is country, but it's far from a country bar, which is great. There's many big tvs everywhere. They show 80's rock videos on some of the tvs, and that's the music you'll hear. The other tvs are showing all sports games. Great place for music or sports.

We love this place. We've been going here for 5 years. Great food. Great atmosphere. Great prices. Fantastic tvs for sports & music videos. The service is top notch.

I've been to all the other places in Westgate. Don't bother. I went to Buffalo Wild Wings during their happy hour. Mistake!  Their wings were $12. I sat there thinking if I was just a few bars over, I'd be paying $5 for more better wings at Saddle Ranch!

Saddle Ranch is huge, and has a very large wrap around patio with 2 outdoor bars. People take advantage of the great happy hour pricing, and come in large groups. Great for any kind of group event, inexpensive, and quality."

G4X5w5vRQNEFUmrJo6JakA,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,2,"1 star for drinks. 2 stars for everything else.

My husband and I went here because we had a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate. I've been to Westgate numerous times, but never McFaddens. We went during happy hour, & knew we couldn't use it on anything happy hour, but it was ok, because none of our drinks or food were on happy hour anyway. We'd be getting $25 off of our bill of $50, so half off. The place was dead. There were 2 other tables with people.

The mixed drinks, horrible. My husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea. A Long Island has 4 different kinds of alcohol in it & a splash coke. His drink looked like pink lemonade.  He cringed when he drank it. Me, I hate the taste of liquor. I tried his drink knowing it's supposed to have 4 kinds of alcohol in it. It tasted exactly like peach juice. There was no alcohol in the drink. I would say zero alcohol. No coke either. It was peachy tasting water. We waited and waited on the waitress to come back to send the drink back. She didn't come back. He went up to the bar and told the bartender to remake the drink while he was standing there watching him. The bartender made a new drink. It was an actual Long Island, and looked completely different side by side to the original drink. It tasted like it should have. My husband told the bartender that the next drink he orders, he wants him to make it. My husband orders drink #2, from the same bartender who he already complained to. The drink was just as bad & awful as the 1st one he sent back. He took the drink back to the bartender, again, and told the bartender it was peach juice. The bartender complained, and copped an attitude, saying they don't over pour their alcohol. We weren't asking them to over pour. We were asking them to make a Long Island, that contains alcohol, and not serve watered down peach juice.

The tvs were good. The food was average tasting. The menu food was about $8-$14. They have happy hour pricing on some appetizers, and some drinks.

We were so angry about the drinks and attitudes, we had to leave. The $25 off didn't matter. I'm giving them 2 stars because we did get half off the food, my beers, and peach water.

If you're going for mixed drinks, don't go here. It's the worse mixed drinks we've had. When you complain, they turn it around on you, like it's your fault."
vyDW7_CHhDUJshMqaSjj0g,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,2,"I have really mixed reviews with this bar / restaurant. It's very casual and has a great outdoor patio in the front facing the semi-private street. I liked the atmosphere a lot. It's more sports related. There's multiple seating on the large patio as well as inside the bar. The bottled beer specials are unbeatable for a downtown bar. Beer, wine, and mixed drinks are 1/2 off. The bottles averaged $2 on happy hour while other bars average $4-$5 for bottles.. Happy hour outside on the patio is 3-6. It's continued to 7pm if you go inside the restaurant. Pricing on bottles is definitely, A+. They have a happy hour food menu with $4 and $5 pricing and a nice selection. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. My experience was completely soured when I ordered the Mexican pizza on the happy hour menu. Mexican pizzas are supposed to be pizzas hence the name pizza. This was a very cheap, flat cheese crisp with limited cheese and jalapenos.It was a cheese crisp at best. It was by far the worse aka Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I immediately complained to the server. I actually told her it was horrific, not a pizza, and the worse example of a Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I told her I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. She completely agreed!!! She also said it looked horrible and wasn't worth eating!!! YET, there was no offer to comp it off my bill or bring the manager over. I told her to tell the cook it was awful. She just kept agreeing. I didn't get compensated for it, no apology, just nothing. I left the entire thing sitting on the table. If you're looking for cheap bottled beer, a pretty cool atmosphere, and easy parking, this is your place. I couldn't rate it a 1 star because of the other perks. Not comping me and agreeing how horrible the food was is unacceptable."
tcgmfbWugkHI3FRrjlH6lQ,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"this is a great place to go if you're looking for quality food at AFFORDABLE prices and a nice cozy atmosphere! they specialize in steaks and seafood but have other choices on the menu. i think this is a romantic place. it's small,  the lighting is low, candles on the table, and just all around intimate. this is not a large chain type of restaurant where you will be lost in the crowd and ignored.  the steaks & primerib are great. the prices are very affordable, much cheaper then anything like outback steakhouse or black angus. i get a large steak for about $15.00 and the primerib is priced under $24.  there are numerous daily fish specials to choose from which range anywhere from $9-$13. there are all sorts of fish dinners. you get an all you can eat salad bar with all meals. the appetizers are good and all appetizers are priced under $8. we always get the calamari. they do have a small bar area in the front. THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS BEYOND GOOD. THE WAIT STAFF IS VERY FRIENDLY AND THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT WILL ALWAYS COME BY AND GREET YOU AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE HAPPY WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE. they treat you very well and appreciate their guests. i go to this restaurant for all special occasions.  as an added benefit, THIS RESTAURANT IS ON  RESTAURANT.COM    IF YOU GO TO THIS WEBSITE, YOU WILL GET $25 OFF YOUR BILL OF $50 OR MORE. feeney's is on 12st, just south of glendale."

UddEGVfbnmXxK6t2mXyicQ,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"i've been here many times. the thing that sets this restaurant apart from others is the view. the restaurant is located in the small airport. you sit by large glass windows and have a clear view of the surrounding mountains and small planes that are coming and going. i go here on two specific nites. tuesdays & wed's.  tuesday, they have an all you can eat buffet. their ribs are very good and also on the buffet were catfish (a rarity on a buffet) and stuffed bell peppers among other things. all three of these are my favorites. buffet is about $9.00 . on wed's, this is an all you can eat rib nite, $9.00. the ribs are good. they give you plenty of sides, bread, soup, and a salad bar, all for the one price. i've always liked the food and service. i love the view. if you get there before dinner, there is an airport giftshop so you can look around and pick up a gift for someone. they have a full menu including breakfast and a kids menu. go for the ribs or buffet nite. either way, you'll get the ribs. oh yeah, they also have an old fashioned glass case that revolves holding big pies and big cakes. good stuff. they also have outdoor seating so you actually sit right along where the planes are parked and close to the runway."
m4yD7dvz998cXM51GbRL_Q,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"I've enjoyed Mel's every single time I've been there. Note, I've only been for breakfast. This is the diner behind the famous 70's show, Alice. The iconic Mel's sign is still standing. There is some retro throwback to the tv show inside. This is a classic diner. No frills, but great food. The skillets are hearty, the french toast is good, the menu is priced very well, and the service is great. My go to is the country fried steak skillet. There are plenty of options and a lot of daily specials. This is next to the fairground at 17 ave and Grand. I especially enjoy the no upcharge for egg whites. If you want a nostalgic diner experience with good food, it's a good place to go."
UCh5BkHQ2vC7XFG2qOJsFA,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,2,"i just don't see the big deal with this place. i've heard about it for years and was actually excited to go here. and i do love to bet on the horses as well and they have off track betting. yes, there is alot of sports memorabilia, mostly college. lots of helmets in display cases. the bar itself feels dirty to me. it's dark and no frills at all. the tables and chairs are below average or average at best. the tvs suck. they have small tvs up towards the ceiling so your neck is cranked up. they have 2 large tvs that are kind of dark. there will usually be a couple of groups hogging those 2 big tvs, so if you want to see your game, you'll be stuck looking up at a small tv and those are usually a little dark or blurred. they have a separate area for horse betters. i don't like that they charge you to sit in that room. the only place to sit in that room is at your own personal tv like the 2nd level at turf paradise, so they charge you to sit there. the food was ok. we were there on a friday for all you can eat fish. well, after ordering several rounds, we found out it wasn't all you can eat. we had to pay for all of it. come on, 99% of places have it as all you can eat fish fry on fridays. the beer was cheaper. i have no idea about mixed drinks. the only reason i would go here is to walk in, look at the memorabilia and leave. also, if you have a large group, i would recommend somewhere else. these tables are small and you would have to push together a few tables. the bar only has a small area of tables."
qJLMG55i5yVOIBgktZK5uA,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"i can only speak about the happy hour food at this restaurant which are all of the appetizers.  i've eaten 1 other time here in the main dining room. ok, during happy hour, the appetizers are 1/2 off. the appetizers are outstanding. you can only get the half off in the bar area, which is also decorated nicely like the restaurant. these aren't ordinary appetizers. there's excellent calamari with a unique dipping sauce, coconut crusted shrimp (large shrimp), an asian flavored chicken & nut lettuce wrap (sizeable amount), and a variety of other appetizers. the appetizers are always good and each are under $4.50. drinks are reduced in price for happy hour. i've always had good food here. the one time i dined in the main area, my meal was large and good quality and was fairly priced. i would give this a big a+ if you are looking for quality appetizers at 1/2 off and sizeable drinks at reduced prices. the main dining area is attractive, different, and they offer alot on their menu."
6KqLBLkHw78t33qObWJxpQ,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,1,"was super disappointed eating here. i saw this restaurant on guy's show, diners drive-ins, and dives. on the show, they showed numerous awards that this owner has won for barbeque. i specifically went for the pulled turkey. i've never seen a barbeque place cook a whole turkey and pull it for barbeque. well, it was very dry. plain all around bad. it had no flavor. it was like eating dirt with barbeque sauce poured on it. the sauce wasn't particulary good either. my boyfriend had a combo platter of 3 meats. they looked as dry as mine. the only thing i liked about my meal was the potato salad. i wouldn't go here for barbeque ever again. i don't know how they made it on a national tv show. maybe their other non-barbeque food is good. maybe the catfish?"
3QQEc5QUP-h6LCkUZQEYQw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,3,"santisis is a place for any sports fan. this looks like some stupid little place from the outside, but it's large and is divided into 2 bar areas. one are is the main large bar with a variety of tables, the big bar, and numerous tvs. the other area is a smaller bar area with tables, darts, pool tables, and a smaller bar.

THERE ARE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES.
the positives:  there are NUMEROUS FLOOR TO CEILING, AND WALL TO WALL tvs. there's tvs on every inch of the walls, large and small. you will see all sports all over the place.  the menu is extensive ranging from your typical wings, to italian, to seafood, to pizza, to barbeque. they are known for their excellent pizza. they do have a happy hour, but i only believe it's for their draft beer and they are known for their monster beers, i think $3.00 or $3.50. the bar is big with alot of tables. large outdoor smokers patio.

the negatives:  it's very dark, almost like a big cave. there are no windows. it gets very crowded and the tables are practically on top of one another. there is zero room to manuever around all of the different tables without knocking into someone. there are alot of really drunk people in here so it doesn't help that there is super limited room to get around.  there are no reduced food prices for happy hour. COME ON, every bar in the entire area accept for padre murphys has reduced food prices or free food during happy hour. they have a $9.00 buffet on fridays from 11-1 with all you can eat wings, pizza, and a couple other things.  their happy hour drink prices are fairly limited depending on what you drink. regular priced drinks are on a higher end. the beer is ok, but if you start drinking shots and mixed drinks, it's higher then other sports bars. their menu items are pricey. just a basket of chicken strips is over $9.00 .  other items range from $7.50-$16.00 .  if you want to watch sports here, GET HERE ATLEAST 1 1/2  HOURS EARLY. gamedays are extremely crowded. the service is actually pretty good considering how busy they are. even though they have tons of tvs, they'll have something stupid on some of them that no one wants to watch, and have the important games on the others, so just because there's alot of tvs, doesn't mean you'll have a clear view of the game you want. and they won't turn the stupid things off. BEWARE, if you are a soda or iced tea drinker, they will give you 1 free refill and charge you for all the rest. they DON'T tell you that until you see multiple charges on your bill.

so, sports,  really good.  tons of tvs. quality food, but pricey.  no food specials for happy hour. ok drink specials on happy hour only. otherwise, drinks are higher then other places. great pizza. very cramped.
suggestion; GO TO RT OSULLIVANS 59 AVE & BELL RD if you want a nicer sports bar with better pricing and also has a huge amount of plasmas everywhere."
-YGePLsJ2pYccR3oaeCSAw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,5,"This restaurant is located in the Embassy Suites hotel. Don't let the expensive hotel fool you. The prices at the restaurant are very good and affordable. I specifically go here for the huge prime rib. It's awesome. I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Stop wasting money on expensive smaller prime ribs at Outback or some other steakhouse. The large prime rib here is $16.95 and comes with 2 authentic southern sides of your choice, soup, salad, and rolls. It's a great price and great meal. You can get the still large, but smaller prime rib for $13.95. There's so much good food and large portions, I rarely finish it.  They also take Restaurant.com gift certificates. Our 2 large prime rib meals come to $35.00, and you get $25.00 off of that!! You can't go anywhere and have 2 big and complete prime rib dinners for $10!! Their other food is very good. I've had their crab cakes, chicken dish, and all their sides. Their sweet potato souflee is awesome. Green beans almondine, so good with the bacon. If you want to impress someone, take them here. The ambiance is classy, beautiful, yet you can dress casually. Use a restaurant.com here and your date or group will think you've spent lots of money, when in fact, it's very cheap. Their other meals range from $8-$15. They also have sandwiches, burgers, chicken, seafood, and pasta. I'm getting married in October and we're taking our wedding party here and out of state relatives. I'm getting a restaurant.com certificate - If we spend $150 (which we will with a large group), we get $75 off that bill !! This is a great place for quality food, a beautiful and romantic atmosphere, and cheap dining.  I'm giving this restaurant a price range of cheap because you can use a restaurant.com for lunch or dinner and the bill ends up being very inexpensive. There is also a nice bar right next to the restaurant. You can also eat in the bar and watch the plasma's if you want."
MbAsfN3wwV22K7GZsgcBqA,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"cool atmoshpere. very pleasant and relaxing. menu prices are higher. they averaged $12-$14 a person. the food was very good. they do a different take on mexican food and have many choices on their menu that are not the typical mexican dishes. they add seafood and you can immediately see and taste the quality of the food. i just thought it was pricey. they have a full bar with happy hour prices and a nice outdoor patio for sitting. if you want a very good and different mexican food experience, this is your place. however, it is more expensive then alot of mexican restaurants. they belong to restaurant.com, so you can get huge discounts on certificates for eating there. good all around place. i just didn't the like the more expensive pricing."

J5ebC7fKqrSF8KuS8d6hgw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"This is the first time I've ever been here. I went because I was given a gift certificate. We went for dinner. Expensive. Quality. Upscale but very casual dress.  Large wine selection. Bring your wallets.

Dinner - I ordered Pork Osso Busco - $25.00. It was served on cheddar mashed potatoes with well flavored zuccini, squash, carrots, and cooked vidalia onions, and a southwestern spicy green sauce all over it. My dinner was large, and the food was fantastic. The meals here have a southwestern flair and are upscale.

My husband ordered Carne Asada Quesadillas served with rice & beans $23. He thought it was very good. The portion size was average.

We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer. It was $14.00. You only get 4 shrimp. Although very tasty, far overpriced for 4 shrimp.

All salads & soups are extra money. A dinner salad, alone, is $7.00. Dinner prices are $18 (the lowest) - $25. Average price is $23. Again, soup & salads aren't included in any meal.

The ambiance was nice. Very appealing. Casual. I thought it was loud. It was busy.

Sandwiches are roughly $15. I noticed most people in the restaurant ordered sandwiches. Definitely cheaper than dinner.

The food very good. My portion size was large. My husband's very average. The 4 shrimp very good, but way overpriced for $14. Most of the appetizers were around $9. The food here is unique, flavorful, upscale, but you are also paying more $$. We ordered the chocolate multan lava cake. $9. Good, but very small.

I didn't have to pay for anything, since someone gave me a gift certificate. Personally, I couldn't afford $25 dinners, $14 appetizers, $7 salads......

If you don't care about the cost, it's a very quality place for food & ambiance.

They have a good happy hour in the bar, only. a variety of $6 unique appetizers. $3 bottled beer, $6 wine.

Nice restaurant for a romantic date, or go during happy hour for quality appetizer for $6. Happy hour is in the bar, only."
e-Hw1QkvwM2wN5Wm7p_msw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"i like old country alot. the selection and quality is better then most other buffets in their category.  for dessert lovers, they offer a much bigger selection. i don't eat anything with sugar, and this is one of the few buffets that offers any kind of sugar free dessert. hometown does not. this place is much better then hometown in all ways. however, old country is not open during the week for breakfast. they have  nice dinner items such as cooked to order steaks, roast beef, shrimp, and alot of other choices. pricing is fair."
ydt5yifyYhF5s430llv_Hw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,3,"I loved the atmosphere. If you're from Glendale or Scottsdale, it's very much like the Sandbar, just a lot bigger. It has a huge outdoor tropical theme patio. There's a huge indoor bar and many tables and booths. I went here for the 1/2 off appetizers and 1/2 off drinks. Bottled beer was $2. The appetizers were around $4. I ordered the drunk shrimp and wings. The shrimp were very good and came with a variety of sauces to choose from. The wings were average, but they gave me a lot, 18. Don't know why, but good for me. They definitely have a party atmosphere, kind of like something you'd see in Cabo San Lucas . They have misters all over the patio. I liked everything about the atmosphere and prices on the appetizers and drinks. The only downfall is I thought the bartenders at the bar were all unfriendly. They never smiled or asked how the food was. If you're looking for ""personal and friendly"" bartenders, it's not here. I think they're too busy. It's a very busy place. The other thing they don't tell you, is they place a hold authorization on your card. My bill was $28. When I got home, I looked at my bank account. The bartender put a $25 hold on my card and a separate $75 hold on my card!! So, for my $28 bill, they had $100 pending on my account. I called and complained to the manager the very next day. He said it has to be my bank because they will never put a $75 hold on a card. He did say they do put the $25 on it. I confirmed with my bank it wasn't them. I called him back. I told him who the bartender was who did it. He was very nice and apologized, and said he had no idea why she would do that. I had to wait 3 days for the $100 authorization to drop off. I would've ranked this place 4 stars if the bartenders were at least a little friendly and they didn't put $100 hold on my card for just me."
VbuqVOVUT4HYXKI6B_S59A,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"Loved this restaurant. Someone called this a bar. It's not a bar. It's a modern, classy, but very comfortable & casual restaurant with a bar in it. There's a lot of grey slate used as part of the decor. Very attractive restaurant, bar, &  atmosphere. It's cool, has different areas to sit in the restaurant, as well as seating at the bar and to the side of the bar. They have a great outdoor patio covered with pretty red tarps for outdoor seating. I liked the entire layout & atmosphere.

We went on a Sunday. We just missed happy hour. They have happy hour every Saturday & Sunday until 5pm. They have a $6 special on a 1/2 pound angus burger, and you build it with whatever you want. Great deal! Appetizers & drinks are reduced. They have a short reverse happy hour from 8pm-9pm on weekends.

We used a restaurant.com, and got $15 off our bill.

All burgers are 1/2 pound angus beef. . I ordered the patty melt with very sauteed onions and mushrooms,and melted cheese. Very good. The onions & mushroom were fantastic.  It needed no condiments. My burger was $9 and came with a great variety of side choices, I got the sweet potato fries. Good, with a light flavor.

My husband ordered the steak wrap which was served on a healthier wheat tortilla, with sliced steak, and lots of sauteed vegetables in it. Very good, too.

We ordered the hot crab dip appetizer. This is a must buy. Fantastic!! This comes with home made potato chips, and a bowl of delicious hot creamy crab dip. This was awesome. $9.00. They serve it with way too many chips, but you can always bring them home.

For a Sunday, the restaurant & bar were busy. We got there just after happy hour ended, so there were people there from earlier taking advantage of happy hour food and pricing.

The service was outstanding. The wait staff were very attentive and constantly refilled our drinks.

Everyone around us was having a very good time. Definitely a great place for food, atmosphere, modern, cool, and comfortable. It was interesting to see all of the high end cars in the parking lot - Escalades, BMW's, Porsches....yet they were all there drinking the cheaper drinks & food on happy hour.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of tvs. There was one in the bar area. I didn't see another one. I'm a big sports fan, so I would want to be able to see a tv here or there in the restaurant or a couple more in the bar area.

Highly recommend. Great food. Great atmosphere. Very casual, but modern and nice. Prices for entrees range from $7.50-$22. The average prices were $8-$11."

THERE IS ALSO OFF TRACK BETTING FOR HORSES!  in the main room is a bar surrounded by tables. i think it looks pretty cool. all the tables have black table cloths and candles. there are multiple tvs for betting or sports.  the food is advertised as ecclectic. the menu is large with a great variety of food. this is not just plain bar food. they have ribs, steaks, calamari, sandwiches, burgers, chicken, pasta, etc....  i think the food is really good. the steaks are great and they give you plenty of quality vegetables for sides. the salads are large and they have a variety of specialty salads. appetizers are priced better then other places. they have a cheap appetizer menu 7 days a week for happy hour. appetizers during happy hour are ONLY $3.00. they have simple appetizers like wings up to really good like calamari. 3.00! they are known for their deep fried pickles which i find good. if you are looking for a more quiet place to sit other then the bar area and tv area, there is a separate dining room. i've never been let down by their tasty food and quality service. you can go here for a good party time, a romantic dinner, or a family dinner. good all around place. they have a smokers patio with misters."

whAwdYVty-jSNRhrYT2zHA,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"this restaurant has really good quality seafood. the menu is large. the restaurant is large, romantic and has a separate bar area. it's very pretty and classy on the inside, but not snooty, meaning you can go casual and relax. the food has always been good especially the catfish. the prices are ok.  they're generally anywhere from $11-$15 for a really nice meal. of course there's pricier choices depending what you're getting.  it's a great atmosphere especially for a romantic date. the only downside, IT'S ALWAYS PACKED WHETHER YOU GO THERE FOR LUNCH OR DINNER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK. IT'S ALWAYS SUPER BUSY. if it's an especially busy nite like a friday or saturday, they will give you a pager. sometimes the wait is over 1 hour. alot of those people go to fridays directly next door for cheaper drinks then go back to pappadeaux when it's gets closer to getting a table."
up-RKqEfV9iIrtc6iyCDfw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,2,"I've been here for breakfast a few times. I have no idea why this place is so busy. It's way overpriced on every single meal and not any better than any other breakfast place. I find the food boring and small. The standard price here is $9.00 or higher. There may be 3 items cheaper than that and they're all small. Their ""cheap"" breakfast is $4 for 1 egg and hash browns. I find that unacceptable. I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. You can go to Country Boys at 35 ave & Cactus for their standard $3 special with 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and meat and you get multiple breakfast options for $3.00 at Country Boys. The cheapest other  breakfast on this menu is $6.75-$7.50 for french toast and meat. Otherwise, you're paying $9+ for everything else. I've had the corned beef omelette, twice, boring, flavorless. Today I had 2 very small eggs, small portion of hash browns, and biscuits & gravy. The biscuits were large and homemade. Gravy flavorless.

I just wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Pricey. No flavor. Small portions. I'm only giving it 2 stars because they do serve giant pancakes. Get their pancake breakfast and split it between 2 people. I feel my self aggravated after paying so much for a meal when I'm leaving still hungry.

Jj8ubiwwuCR-rrhrrjcryw,EzOF8RLzbcsA9EwMYlUfsg,4,"Not an oxymoron...Great service Vietnamese Restaurant

I've been here several times and it is about time I gave my review.  I'm from So. Cal so I grew up with very good Vietnamese food.  It is one of my favorite places to come to in the Valley because of the food, friendly service and all this for an affordable cost.  This is a true dive or hole in the wall for sure, but the food makes up for the lack in decor.  Besides the Pho, the Banh Xeo (Crepe) and rice dishes are very tasty as well.  You have to realize that the cost of gathering all the ingredients and cooking it yourself would usually be higher than coming to eat here for any meal.  And if you happen to see Banh Bao on the table in front, you have to try it.  They do not serve this daily which they should, but it is a white pastry filled with steamed barbeque pork and some hard boiled egg.  When you get it fresh, you'll thank me for tasting this hidden gem.  Hands down best in the valley and rivals those made in Little Saigon, California.

The ROA (Ratio of Authenticity) is usually 0.65-0.75. (# of Ethnic Patrons (Vietnamese in this case) / Total # of Patrons) at any given time which for me is pretty authentic for Phoenix.  I've been in other Vietnamese restaurants which were supposedly voted the best in the valley, but is horrible by VN standards.

I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the decor."

Skillet corned beef hash is delicious.  Belgium waffles cooked with perfect combination of crispy outside with moist center topped off with there signature ""Butters"" syrup.  It is clear why there is always a long wait on weekends.  Our waitress very cordial and aware of her table and cleanliness of the table.  There was little spillage from our orange juice and she quickly alerted another wait staff to help clean our table.  She came to check on us twice.  (Once is considered standard).  The decor is Clean and modern and impressive.  On a first impression Butters delivers a strong showing on what is basic of American breakfast staple.  I would have to go again to check on consistency."

Service was abundant and constantly on the move. Smiles/laughter/rushed looks/attentive and enthusiastic attitudes. Busy. Front table stocked with homemade cookies and giant slices of plain cake (but cake that is unassuming--packed with oh-so-amazing flavor--looks are deceiving!) Take some home on your way out.

Had the pig knuckle pho with pig's blood. It was amazing. The spring rolls are huge and cheap. The pancake was perfectly crispy and huge. The bbq pork and fish cake bun was served with lots of meat in a huge bowl and we had more herbs/lettuce/limes, etc. than we ever could want or need. The shrimp stuffed tofu was ample. The whole meal for two was under $30, including a Thai coffee and iced tea. We were stuffed and walked away with leftovers."
DMyoxEaTGTakZxWgh1D5bw,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"I wasn't expecting to be impressed, but I was.

Normally when I see a high traffic/expensive restaurant adjacent to a mall I'm skeptical, but today I was hungry and didn't want junk. The posted menu seemed inspired so I went in for a solo lunch at the bar. Very clean eating here, but they truly bring the flavor, and you will not leave hungry! Excellent choice for lunch or dinner.

Started with Pellegrino and black coffee. The bartender was friendly and helpful.
I like exploring the different methods of cooking chicken tortilla soup so I started with a small cup of that. Normally I prefer a clear, strong broth with lots of chicken and cilantro. Seasons' version is creamy and thick. The fresh cilantro is there, as is the roasted bits of chicken--really liked that-- but it was almost too thick for me. There were a lot of tortilla strips on top as well. If that's what you like you will love this version. The flavor is very good.

The tuna tartare starter was the star, and had I known I'd be fuller from the heavy soup, I'd have made it my lunch entree. I was expecting sliced tuna, but what I got was so much better! They serve diced raw tuna over a bed of avocado/wasabi mousse that has a thin layer of pineapple salsa. The whole thing is molded like a larger sized tuna fish can (to give you an idea of the size). It is served with a cone of extra crispy/spicy flat breads. I loved everything about this dish!

For my lunch entree' I ordered the red mole beef brisket tacos --with lettuce wraps rather than tortillas (they give you the choice). There are three ample tacos to this dish, served with sides of cilantro/verde sauce and red mole/chile sauce. These tacos were amazing. I had to take my time as I was full from the tuna.

Very good experience. Definitely going back!"
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,3,"Three stars because it is very average. Not bad, though. Our definition of pizza is what one gets in Naples. This place doesn't disappoint in terms of crust--it is wood fired. Their red sauce is good, also. However, the parmesan is melted, and the mozerella is stringly. All the cheese is overdone. The menu choices are limiting---the combinations offered are Americanized. You'd do well here to make off menu requests, probably. The Sonny Boy would be better if the olives were sliced---the presentation of whole olives on the pie is luxe, but the bite, while delicious, is too overwhelming. The rocket (arugula) on the biancoverde was not baby rocket, and it was dull--a bit past its freshness date, and with no spicy zing. The cheese was overwhelming, and overall flavor was bland. Would not order it again. This place is in a good location and is priced high --and hyped up--for tourists, although many locals love this place. Our lunch bill for two pies, two salads, two peronis and one glass of house wine was $77, not including the tip. If you want true Napoli pizza at a much better value (& less touristy), go to Pomo, a place which feels more Italian, has better cocktails, authetic Italian desserts, and is (slightly) less expensive."
momjERcb6G6ienrfPuNArw,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,2,"Was excited to find a pho place near Costco on I-10, since I shop there semi-weekly. I live in Laveen, which is not close to any pho--and I LOVE pho. I typically go to Glendale or north Phoenix for pho. I have tried almost every pho place in Phoenix, and this one would have been an excellent addition to my rotation because of where they are located. Despite the two stars rating I would go back to Pho Du Lat again if I am ever shopping at Costco or Total Wine, and having a craving for VIetnamese---however---let me be clear that it is only because of the location. But I'd be complaining about how much they charge for what I get AND the lack of some very important essentials. So, if you want an EXCELLENT pho place to try--THIS ONE IS NOT IT. Let me explain.

The restaurant is a good size and clean. Bathrooms are clean. Service is fine. Not spectacular, but basically good. You can get in and out for lunch in a reasonable time. The staff is lackluster, though. Let's just say unenthusiastic, okay?

I ordered a dry noodle dish (I chose egg noodles) that came with fish ball, pork, chicken, beef ball and shrimp. I ordered it because it comes with the pork broth on the side, and the entree has a *spicy* star next to it, and I like spicy dishes.

The server asked me on a scale of 1-5 for hotness. I chose a 4. So...let me tell you what I got....
I got an unusually small serving of food. A small portion of egg noodles that were cooked fine (but sticky, which is common, so I had to use my broth to separate them--not a big deal), but the meat was so freaking skimpy. There was a fish ball a little bit smaller than the diameter of a quarter. The beef ball was somewhat bigger, and cut in half. There were two medium/small shrimp (the menu says ""jumbo""--but they aren't remotely jumbo) and there was a few strands of bland, boiled/rubbery flavorless chicken and two tiny, thin pieces of pork. The meat sat hidden under the small portion of noodles and on top was a smattering of ripped up romaine lettuce. The broth, as advertised, came on the side. The broth was good, and contained the grilled shallots. This dish cost $8, but you or I would have spent about 99 cents making it, if that. The heat level was around 1 or 2 at most. I had to request chili/garlic paste----and she returned with a meager tablespoon in a small dish.

There were NO herbs...No cilantro. No limes or lemons. No fresh, cut jalapenos. No fresh, chubby bean sprouts. NONE of the tables had any garlic/chili paste, spoons, chopsticks, etc.

My solo lunch included iced tea and an order of vegetarian spring rolls. The spring rolls were pakced tightly with romaine and lacked any herbal flavor. The sauce was primarily fish hoisin sauce with crushed peanut in it. I much prefer a thick peanut based sauce with chili flakes. This stuff was okay, but not what I prefer...

The total cost (NOT including tip) was $15.09. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR LUNCH. That being said, if the food was outstanding and worth driving to, I'd have happily paid $15 for it. It was NOT THAT GREAT. It was...MEH."
gSPqD1DR3lzgoaifIhdF_w,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"Squid Ink is a sushi bar located on Central Avenue in downtown Phoenix (most central/southern-most edge of the downtown area). There is a fee for the parking garage, which is located in the same building. It is very convenient.

The hostess who seated us looked rather unkempt, and she had pimply shoulders, which were exposed in a stringy tank top and kinda gross, but she was friendly. At first, the service was slow. We didn't know when the server would come and take our order--granted the restaurant was full, which is actually a good sign.

Once we got our drink order in it took a few minutes longer than we would have liked, but then things got rolling. We ordered several courses, and quite a lot of sushi. All of our food came out rather quickly. Way faster than I would have imagined for any restaurant, much less a sushi bar (which typically takes more time).

The miso is excellent. The seared beef dish was incredible--the meat was tender, like butter. Amazing! The cooked salmon with the kale salad was ""the best ever"" according to our table guest. The sashimi platter and suhi roll platters were just a scosh sparser than we would have liked, but the fish was impeccable. Really. Wow!

House chardonnay was buttery, not metallic. Water and tea were refilled with regularity, and as the food arrived we realized the whole staff worked very well together as a team. More than five different people came and went from our table, making sure we were taken care of. Everyone was friendly and professional.

Over all the value was very good. The prices were good. We loved our meal and we are definitely going back there!

If you sit outside there is a misting system, so you stay cool. Plus, the people watching is really fun.

Happy hour is all throughout the week--half price ""starters"", so that's always a good deal.

It took a long time for a server to stop by to greet us.  I ordered a glass of wine and didn't get it until my meal (after the appetizer and salad).  Our waitress had clearly forgotten to bring it to me.  When she finally brought it, I had even forgotten I had ordered wine.  ""I thought you would want it with your main course,"" she excused.  What?

We enjoyed the bruschetta as an appetizer.  The salad was ""meh.""  We ordered the prime rib risotto special, which was good and had a nice kick of spice in it.  No one asked us how our food tasted.  No drink refills.  No one cleared our plates, even after we had finished paying.

The servers reached across the table to serve and remove plates instead of properly from the left/right.  We were even asked to hand them our dirty dishes.  The plates they could reach were removed before we were finished with them.

I ordered my steak medium rare.  My steak came out very undercooked and rare.  I didn't eat any of it, I only sliced it down the middle with my knife.  I informed the waiter that my steak was undercooked and they brought me back the same piece of meat, overcooked this time to medium well and turned over to look like a new steak.

Also, it is common practice for steak houses to brush their steaks in butter.  The steaks at Ruth's Chris were served swimming in a pool of butter.  Pools of butter were also collecting in the appetizer and sides we ordered.

I dine at prime steak houses frequently and expected the service and quality of a prime steak house when I made my reservation at Ruth's Chris.  I would not consider Ruth's Chris to be worthy of my dollar or my patronage."

The hostess kept taking her feet out of her shoes and wiggling her toes in the air, which I couldnt help but constantly notice throughout dinner.  The service was okay, but our server never checked up on us to see if we liked anything or if we needed anything else.  I also didn't like that while having a nicer meal, the view next to us was of a bar scene and people playing lawn games, throws off the mood a bit.  The king crab toast was pretty good, I liked the orange in it.  I tried the cajun shrimp with red potato, corn and grilled bread.  It came out on a platter drenched in sauce that was so spicy I couldn't eat it.  Generally, I like spice and cajun seasoning, but this was too much and over everything (including the bread which had gotten soggy from the sauce) so there was nothing to even cut it with.  The shrimp were tough and overcooked.  Our server didn't say anything when he came to get my plate and I hadn't eaten much of my meal.  The burger was so soggy that the bottom bun fell apart.

kblFxfo_xnMUZF0U0aGXQw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,4,"Modern decor and great service.  Sunday happy hour brought us Asian nachos and a tootsie roll.  The Asian nachos were inventive and pretty darn good.  Tootsie roll was pretty standard, and missing the sauce.  Not amazing, but good.  I'll be back."
apdb7MGnmnx6nGWBJ0ch_g,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,What a cute place!  I got a mocha raspberry latte and my friend got an iced coffee.  The salted blueberry muffin was pretty good.  Prices are reasonable.  This place is great to relax and work or to catch up with a friend.  Great outdoor patio for when the weather is nice.
R-Me-p4Rbb0q-2pjSzyDbw,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,1,"I don't understand how anyone could give this place a good review! The food was DISGUSTING! I ordered the mushroom and swiss omelette. The eggs were dry and bland, the cheese tasted like the individually wrapped kraft slices, and they used canned mushrooms.  My boyfriend got french toast, which was made with cheap bread and had huge clumps of egg hanging off of it.  The orange juice was the most horrible tasting juice I have ever drank.  Will not return."
AnOb3EDRIwfVayPWddr78g,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,2,The service was good but the food was awful. The nachos were terrible. The bun was extremely soggy on the chicken burger. The Cajun chicken on the chicken Caesar salad was essentially chicken covered in an extreme amount of raw spices that weren't cooked onto the chicken. I couldn't even eat it.
_mg5bYknpZgaWSfjQVmrJQ,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"We love Spinatos! We have been to the Tempe, Scottsdale, and their previous Phoenix location before they relocated. We picked up a pizza to go tonight and it was as good as always. Their new location is beautiful and they were packed!"

The burger, fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit, fries with gravy on top and fries with bacon and cheese on top are all heavenly. Fried avocado Po' boy was also divine. Add a few hurricanes and I was a happy camper."
VyVIneSU7XAWgMBllI6LnQ,7iljWwtMZPH6gjDY9DKa6Q,5,"I have been here several times now and this is hands down the best BBQ I have ever eaten in my life! The meat is SO tender and delicious and the sides are heavenly.  Any appetizer is amazing- I love the Q Rolls!  Basically, you have to go here to understand!"
FscCtUIsAL8cBL-S-A4FEQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,1,"I just found a maggot in my food here!!!! Stay the hell away from here !

I immediately called the waitress over and she took the plate away before I could take a picture and unfortunately after eating almost half of it. She came back and said the chef would comp that plate only because they dont have those types of problems and dont know how that happened. As I was sitting there thinking about what just happened I asked to speak to a manager. She said let me get them, I heard a lot of yelling in the kitchen in their own language and she came back and said they were gone. I advised her that I was going to call the health department and she then said the chef would completely comp our entire meal."
Yb2lzZilR6vnx0fffPSx8w,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,2,"The barista seemed nice but came in for tea....didnt like their teas as much as Jarrods down the street. I might come back to try their coffee but not sure.

Bad vibe....Had 2 filthy couches ( I felt if I sat on them I might get bit or something, mind you I am not boojie or anything...It was just gross ), a pool table, and several high top tables. Felt more of a bar that served food than a little coffee shop. The bathroom is dingy and smelled like urine (again reminded me of a bar ).

However they make some baked goods and tried their zucchini bread....not too bad. I also bought some other goodies to bring home....

They also sold ice cream, I believe Thrifties.

But honestly not sure if I would come back there...been there, tried that type of thing !"
Xg7gOJjwtzmFGBxtSfOBlA,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"There is an authentic Vietnamese vegetarian menu...Just ask for it!
This place is great...they cater to meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans who want either an authentic Vietnamese fare or the traditional American Vietnamese fare. They even have different menus too. I always order from the authentic Vietnamese vegetarian one....But be aware...they have A LOT of options on their menus!
If you order from the authentic Vietnamese menu, your order will take a lot longer than from the regular menu...and you can tell, they take their time in preparing each dish. Its definitely worth it ! So dont be in a rush here... ..

Everything I have always ordered was delicious.  They even have brown rice!  I just dont care for their fake pork substitute in anything. Not a fan of the fake meats but their chicken substitute and their beef substitute in their authentic dishes are pretty good.

We always order one their salads as an appetizer, they are all delicious with their unique flavors. Lotus root with mango salad is probably my favorite. Veggie pho, lots of noodles, soups and rice dishes...too many to list.

The owner is real sweet too. She always checks in with you to see if you like the dish.

We will definitely be back to check out something different from their extensive menu.

Place is across the street from Mekongs plaza tucked away at the corner of a strip mall, near a smoke shop. Its two restaurants in one......"
sUAJOwb1yFaSDreFADEO5Q,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Came here on a Wednesday night and it was empty. I was leary but also thought about my fellow Yelpers saying that them too were sitting with an empty restaurant and mentioning service was slow. I decided to give it a try since this was the closest restaurant by the Mesa Art Center and we were really hungry after class and boy were we pleasently surprised!

Ordered the veggie spring rolls that were very delicious btw. Flavors of ginger and pepper with mushrooms and glass noodles and other veggies were really tasty. You can tell they were made fresh and not store bought rolls ( I hate when asiain restaurants do this ).

Lil guy got the vegetarian pad thai and he was very happy...I tried a bite and it definitely wasnt that overpowering sweet sauce they put in other thai places but more of a touch of smokey tamarind sauce...very good!!!

I ordered ( I cant remember for the life of me what it was called but ) a plate of steamed veggies broccoli, carrots, & cabbage combo with fried tofo, served with rice and a side dish of peanut sauce and another side dish of a spicy lime sauce and OMG together the flavors were DELICIOUS!  I must admit, it looked pretty plain when it came out and I was starting to second guess my choice but after I tried it....I knew it was the best decision I made !! Soooo good !!!!

Waiter was nice and helpful but we did have to ask for waters after our food came out. He probably thought we were content with our coffees we brought in but he never even asked us what we wanted to drink. Probably my only complaint there and it really didnt bother us that much since he brought it right out.

Restaurant has plenty of seating. Clean and open. Plenty of tables and booths.
Bathroom was pretty...better decorated than the restaurant ~ odd !
Wait time for our food was minimmal so we were happy about that too!!!

We will definitely be back !!!"
iNbAht5CVY4KH_cympbHMA,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"Updating review: THEY NOW HAVE VEGAN CHEESE !!! Regular crust and red sauce are also vegan too....Lots of veggie options as well....It actually was pretty good too. Can now definitely eat here with the family !!!
Staff were pretty cool here too.....a homeless guy came in for food and the guy working today was really good with him and treated him like a human being.....it was good to see, I wish more establishments in the area did the same ! Not sure what the dudes name was but he definitely was a good guy...good hearted dude !!!"
S5o2kplwZtc9XWdktq_GcQ,ib-M7U7ddqD1Ues7xcqOxQ,4,"So happy to see their wait staff change from all white top to bottom to now just a white shirt, tie, black pants and black shoes. Not sure why in the world they made their staff where all white at one time....it was not clean at all....it was actually disgusting seeing them especially their shoes all dingy from their floors....ok rant over, now on to my review for the evening.

Arrived at 9pm for dessert and coffee with the family. We were seated immediately, with waters only moments later.

We all ordered cheesecake and coffee. My favorite is the tuxedo. The combination of the sweet cheesecake paired well with the bitterness of their plain cold brew.

Server, cant remember her name....sorry but she had a sweet Mickey Mouse tie....lol...was very attentive and nice !

Didnt wait long for our order , we were in and out within 40 minutes !!!

Will definitely be back to this location."

pjpUOlJLlkIxBZ5BquA2PA,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,David the bartender is an awesome multi tasker. I sure wish i had an employee this talented and professional. The food has been wonderful so far. Fresh and imported ingredients. Even my body builder guy enjoyed the food.  Most of the time he is anti Italian food. Pomo has a great atmosphere in addition to pleasant people service and outstanding food

The perfect dining experience. Ill have to blame that on Brittany.  She was attentive, on point and spectacular at customer service and the cooked had her back by cooking us perfect burgers. She suggested the perfect drink and treated us as if we were her friends and she was our hostess.  And if course i had the best company in the house. Thanks Flemings for having us tonight. Doesn't matter if we are dressed up or dressed down we always get the great service"

Fish tacos are not fishy but definitely filling, chefs enchilada soup was sooooo good, guacamole burger was very juicy n tasty and the cheese n carne asada dip is amazing!!!  Enough of what I've eaten. Come out n try it for yourself. Best bar food by far!!!!  Any football, baseball, hockey game, fight you want to see. Its here. Great for team get togethers.

The serving portions are perfect, I saved some for dinner so I can enjoy the food twice in one day.  Since I left Texas I've yearned for that perfect culture food, destination reached. The atmosphere is happy, colorful, fun. Totally reminds me of my Texas roots.  Will definitely be returning here especially when the family comes to visit"
fSBhe0A6Dfa8JCYccfpMog,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,The best bagels in AZ. My favorite is the Loks bagel minus the onions on a toasted everything bagel. Cal and his cree have this down perfectly.
8yAVuMwtijEosdjiCrtyXQ,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,"This is priced so perfectly. If your company is on a budget. This place is budget friendly. Not only is the pizza good but so is the customer service.  Gluten free pizza?  Its the only way to eat pizza, well, at least for me it is."

No biggie, no charge. But man o man. It Was fantastic. My mai tai was so beautifully created too by the young male brown, wavy haired bartender.  Who i must say is outstanding at customer service and well rounded. He will go far in any service business. Wish he worked for my business"

This IS the PIZZA joint. The Gelato is always good on the way out too. Today, I'm just full and content with my drink and great pizza."
gBsrs7a3w6g1YXJL2uwixw,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,Great Pizza and they are quick too.  My favorite is all meat with veggies.

The non sweet tropical berry tea is so refreshing and service was outstanding although, i didn't get his name. Tall, dark hair, charcoal gray/black pita jungle shirt with a tattoo on his right arm, something about love cant remember  what it said. The hummus trio was really good too. The pitas get really hard fast. They're nit as fresh as they used to be when they first opened.   Overall, enjoyed the experience. My company was the best.  He was the icing on my cake"
ITOa1olD2HTgEVOnH8zVog,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,"This mexican food is amazing.  They are always on top of their game.  I enjoy taking friends there and enjoying some great comfort food when I have some spare time to get out of the shop.  My favorite is the taco burrito.
It is ashamed that the old partner will not allow the phone number to change or release this account to the other partner they split with as to convenience the customers to call direct from YELP.  BOO! on the previous ex partner keeping this yelp account hostage."
N5B7OBTyNGgwU_Y2fwNcyw,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,The food is super amazing. I had the chicken rotisserie with Mashed potatoes. I am full but not feeling super stuffed. Zoe was our waitress. She has a great personality to go along with her beautiful self. The Sangria is so flavorful and went down smoothly. My husband had the bbq plate that was the community special.  The cornbread was amazing!!!!!  Can I say amazing again!!!!  No complaints here other than the glare of the sun. You must try this food.
ivAe-BA1y3DOyRUKHdPnQA,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,The service was fabulous!   The food was outstanding and freshly served. The chefs are very meticulous and create a beautiful delivery of the food.

SOOSUg-ugRI8dRQ96r5Fxw,v9KLzK_2OnsWqqyAIFck-w,5,The machaca burrito is my favorite!  It is so good and filling. Thanks Guys for making great food in our community!!  My grandsons like the beAn and cheese burritos.
SzTK3GPoFIkb6k322f1Mmw,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,2,"First time eating here and was unimpressed by the terrible service.I walked in, saw it was an order and pay before you sit place, which is fine, but  I heard they had a bar, so I asked to sit there.The hostess was nice, and pointed me towards the bar.Thats when things went downhill.I was the only person at bar, as I was meeting someone.When I Sat down bartender was hiding in the corner texting, and didnt notice, acknowledge me or even say hi.I sat there a good 10 minutes bein g ignored.Then the So called manager (who is terrible at his job).walks to the bar, sees her hiding and texting, sees me sitting there with no drink, no menu, no nothing, and he says hi amd just walks away.Unbelieveable!!!! At that point I was getting ready to leave but figured I should at least say something, so manager came back and was just standing around bar area, ,at this point its been about 15 minutes of being ignored).I try and get bartenders attention but she doesnt notice, so finally ""manager""sees I am trying to get a drink and tears her away from her texting.She was nice and apologetic, but an awful bartender, had to ask for water refills, never cleared plates, just kinda ditzy.We ordered a pizza and a salad.They were both very good , especially the pizza crust and cheese.But this restaraunt is run by a bun ch of giggly 19 yr old girls who create a high school atmosphere.Also the older male manager is clueless and seems to let these kids goof off I nstead of work.While we were waiting for our pizza, I saw it sitting in the window and 2 employees walked right past it, and proceeded to go chit chat in the corner instead pf running the pizza.Clueless manager ended up running it after it was in the window for 5 minutes.Also there was a waitress there standing in the dining room giving dirty looks to one of her tables and loudly complaining.weird.This place has so much potential, but its run by bad management and apathetic high school girls.Also, if they got rid of the whole order, pay, sit thing it would work much better.Its a shame because the food is good, but ill never go here again after the horrific service."
fOnpoMXToa5Qiyg95E6ENg,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,1,"So after hearing only god things about the place I decided to check it out and see what all the hub bub was about.needless to say,I was very disapointed.we went in around 2pm on a Tuesday.it was not very busy which I like.the less than friendly host/server seated us promptly at a table with dried ketchup stains on it.really??.we asked to move to another table and she obliged but proceeded to give me a dirty look.I know they're famous for their breakfast but I was in the mood for a salad so I ordered the grilled chicken salad.my friend ordered the hungry man breakfast.when I got my salad it looked like something you'd buy at the grocery store in a bag.it was cheap old looking lettuce that was soaking wet.there was barely any chicken in it.and what little chicken I got was stringy and fatty.also the dressing looked and tasted expired.my friend said her breakfast was o.k. but nothing special.when the server asked how the food was I said not very good and explained why.she offered another salad but I declined due to loss of appetite.she didn't even tell a manager or anything.which I don't really mind anyhow.especially because what appeared to be the manager,or should I say,""micro manager"" was too  busy loudly berating one of the employees in front of everyone for what appeared to be just asking a simple question about procedure.very unprofessional.the whole atmosphere inside was unprofessional.the servers look like trailor trash covered in tacky tattoos which some love to show off by cutting off the sleeves of their uniform.now I like tattoos and have some but don't go out of my way to show them off.especially while working with the public.also even though it wasn't busy the server made us feel rushed like we were a bother and dropped our check off while my friend was still eating.then when we were ready to pay we waited almost 15 minutes for no sleeves mcgee to take payment.wtf?bottom line is that the service was awful the food was big in portion size but lacking in quality . I really don't see why everyone loves this place.maybe the breakfast is better?not sure all  I know is I won't be back.if I wanted to be looked down upon by trailor trash i'd move to alabama."
zwNLJ2VglfEvGu7DDZjJ4g,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,2,"I have eaten at arriba several times over the last few years and its usually the same.first of all,I don't know how the hostess even still has a job.she's rude,never smiles or says hello when you walk in.she just looks you up and down and says ""how many?"" In a monotone voice.when its always just me and my boyfriend.what are you blind?then she always no matter what, manages to seat you directly next to the table with screaming kids and babies even when the restaraunt is empty.and she always picks the smallest most cramped 2seater in the house.I understand if it's busy that it's her job to seat according to the flow of the restaraunt,but even when it's dead she does this.we have to ask to switch tables everytime we go there.and no,I have never done anything to piss her off.don't even know her.I just recognize her cuz she's been there forever.anyhow the food is usually pretty good.the bean dip is excellent.the service usually always sucks though.you have to wait forever for drinks and refills even when its not busy.I did actually have 2 good severs there once and was impressed,but usually when I go,I expect bad service.there's even worse service at the bar.I've actually have sat down,got ignored and had to say ""hey can I get a drink""again,it was not busy,so no excuse.the bartenders always too busy watching t.v. to acknowledge you.also,most of the servers look like heroin junkies.no lie,missing teeth and everything.no wonder the turnover rate is so high.but I will say the foods not bad."
sBc7xW4BTuY7E4hnIHgSYg,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,4,"the food was great.i ordered the chicken and vegetables and it came out hot,fresh,and big in portion size.the pieces of chicken were big and plentiful, not stringy or fatty at all.the brown garlic sauce was amazing too.the service was excellent.
try the pomengranite martini,it's delicious and only cost like $5.75 for a decent size glass made with sky vodka.i expected it to cost $7 or $8 when i saw it,but was pleasantly surprised when the bill came.
the decor is modern,clean and sleek.however the location is kinda drab.it's in a fry's parking lot next to a coffe shop and pizza place.
the hot and sour soup and spring rolls are to die for too.
i definately reccomend this place."
qdHFUvFhZjvNie3cZiJb9w,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,2,"We went to arrowhead grill for dinner.I had the salmon.it was good,but plain.no seasoning or sauce.also everything is a la carte so if you want a side of veggies it costs almost $6.it's also very expensive in there.(which I do not mind if it's worth it.)but it just wasn't.food was good but not fantastic.the owner seems more concerned with schmoozing with 90 yr old customers who look like they have $ other than getting food cooked on time.I waited forever,like 30 mins.for my salmon while he was parading around the room with a phony grin on his face kissing only the old wealthy looking customers asses.he totally ignored anyone who appeared under the age of 40.I actually did not want to talk to him anyway,but if youre trying to appear as if you value all your customers don't pick and choose what tables you visit based on age,money,etc.btw I am in no means poor or raggedy looking,and tip better than most people.the service was o.k.nothing great.a few forgotten items,but I think it was because our server was new.she was very nice and apologetic so I did not mind so much.the decor was o.k.they try to say it's fine dining,but it looks like a regular ol restaraunt inside.in my opinion you can get the same quality food for a lot less at outback."
ehCFJyvrw-1_UUwoVV4L8g,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,5,"I love Grande Pizza!I have only eaten here a few times,but it was awesome!
The pizza is good old fashioned east coast style.IE:big and tasty with thick crust.
The service is always friendly and professional,and the place is run by real Italians so they really know thier stuff.
The inside reminds me of the good ol pizza and sub shops that i used to frequent back east.Walk in,order,pay,then either sit in a booth or take the food to go.
No annoying fast food atmosphere,no having to talk to waiters if you're not in the mood,just good quality pizza from a well run establishment.They also have subs,salads,and italian dinners on the menu.I have only had the pizza so far because it's soooo good.
The location is a little hidden.Its in a strip mall near a gym and a filibertos on91st.ave. and union hills,but it is definately some of the best pizza in Arizona."
NpFtNc51LaZr8Y5_o2wRaw,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,4,"Always have had great food and friendly service here.
The bread is excellent and fresh.
Service last time,when we sat at the bar,was a little slow and clueless,but she was very friendly and meant well.I'm not one to get upset easily over a couple of forgotton items.Had to ask for our waters twice because she forgot both times.
But still,had a good time and great food.
Prices are very reasonable too.
I highly reccomend."
-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,5,"I  only have eaten here once,but was impressed.the pizza was excellent and the side salad that you can add on is one of the best ive ever had.also,being italian and from the east coast i have had some of the best italian food in the country, and i think la piazza al forno ranks right up there.(especially since arizona has the worst italian food/pizza in the country.(inmy opinion,and many others too.)
the lasagne was out of this world.it reminded me of what mom used to make.Excellent marinara sauce as well.
the service was average.nothing special.
Being a server mysel,f i like that they won""t split checks or seat groups until they have all arrived.Hello........it's a small restaraunt.they can't ""hold a table for your party and miss out on business just to wait for a group that may or may not show.
also sometimes splitting checks is a nightmare if the people are old, and keep switching seats,ordering in intervals,and changing thier drinks everytime they order a new one.its very time consuming to split checks when the guests do things like that.also, with the limited space they have ,i think it's a good business decision.
usually people who are so concerned about splitting checks are cheap,don't tip well,use coupons,and order the cheapest thing on the menu and drink only water anyway.
if people are that concerned,they should bring cash and do the simple first grade math to figure out what they owe.
anyway i highly reccomend this place."
Ps5kdt-BC9zahJasErkd5Q,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,4,"About a year ago i used to dread coming here only because of the long lines and incompetent  employees,but have always liked the food so i chose to endure it.But my last few visits have been much better.They hired a bunch of new people who are fast and friendly.no more are the days of waiting in line for 20 minutes while the employees slowly prepare each meal,while dilly dallying.The food is always good,and the portions are huge!My only complaint is,if you go in after 9,they're usually low on meat so you end up with less than you'd normally get if it was earlier. they should really have enough prepared for the later crowd because there's always people in there after 9.Other than that,i have nothing bad to say.I am very pleased that they have stepped up thier game when it comes to service.Keep up the good work guys."
UsJMY1BCxlZUs614ONTlfg,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,2,"I used to enjoy coming here a few years ago,but it sure has changed.T hey blast awful music on fri and sat nights.all played by a clueless d.j. who only plays a cross between bad rap,techno,and whiney hipster music.they used to play a variety of rock,rap,alternative,classic rock, and rnb which was fine.
The food is actually pretty good and they have .a great happy hour.
I usually only come here on weekdays now,and it's always good on those days.
Service is usually good,and they have$1 tacos on wednesday afternoons.
Had excellent service by the bartender last time too.
but i will never come on a weekend.they're trying to be a dance club now,and failing miserably.
Nice outdoor patio though."

dPGs5b0N9MarZjVgQVelGQ,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,4,"My boyfriend and i just ate there afew hours ago and it was great.our server was very nice and sweet.they served my soda in a huge glass and refilled it as needed without me having to ask.the wheat bread they give you before dinner is awesome.the white not so good.I ordered off thier new light menu.(called skinny something or other don't remember)I had the chicken soft tacos.they were excellent.I couldn't even tell they were low cal.they also had cabbage in them and the cilantro was seasoned nicely to add lots of flavor.my b.f. ordered a burger well done and it was cooked just right.I never eat burgers but I tried a bite of his just to see,and it tasted great,like it was fresh off the grill.the rice that came with my tacos was very flavorful and a good size portion as well.the only complaint I had was that as I sat down,I noticed a lil black hair on my napkin/linen.luckilly I saw it before I used it.I asked for a new one and the server was nice and apologetic about it.honestly it was so small I can see how it was overlooked.these things happen.I don't blame anyone for that.overall it was a good dining experience .(minus the hair of course)."
cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,3,"I went here for the first time after hearing rave reviews about it.I was never offered any ""free samples"" that everyone keeps taliking about:(.The kid at the counter knew it was our first time there too.He was very nice and helpful though.
I thought the food was pretty good,but did not really like the menu so much.It seems like the only chinese chicken they have is either,ginger,deep fried,or jerk.All of which I'm not a fan of.Oh yeah they do have terryaki chicken,which i ordered.It was pretty good.Also the white rice i got was perfectly cooked.I sampled some of my B.F.'S Jerk chicken and black beans and they were delicious!I usually hate jerk chicken,but Chino Bandido's is awesome.
I thought the food was good,nothing special.I really did not like the ordering process.(fill out a form and hand it in???)weird.Also the decor is dingy,drab,depressing,and dirty.Reminds me of a high school cafeteria.(only not as clean).
The cookie they gave us with our meals was really good too.I think it was a snickerdoodle.
Overall the food was good,but i don't see why everyone acts like it's the best food ever.It's not THAT great.
T he atmosphere is what really turned me off.I'd eat here again,but really gotta be in the mood for it.I know it's fast food,but it got a little annoying when every customer who came in after us decided to sit RIGHT next to us even though there were plenty of empty tables.And they all had loud, whiney kids with them too.(obviously not chino bandido's fault)but still annoying."
RtnTbhWYw4QjKhoTBV37OA,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,2,"Have not been here in a while.Always had great service in the past,so went last night for a beer and some food.Got acknowledged pretty quick within seconds of sitting down.I didn't know what kind of beer I wanted so told the bartender I needed a drink menu and a minute or so to decide on beer.Well that was a huge mistake because he never came back to take my order.Granted, they were busy,but I seriously sat there waiting to order a drink for 10 to 15 minutes.I wouldve just left but was with friends who had got there before me and already had drinks.There were about 4 bartenders behind the bar, all of which ignored me.Finally, We had to flag one down after he came within our vicinity to take orders from people who arrived well after I did.I understand they were busy, but Even when they got a little breather, They would hurridly walk like they were doing something important only to see them stop and do something like fold a napkin, or put down a fresh coaster for someone who already had a drink.I wanted food, but knew that was never gonna happen.So I didnt bother asking for a menu.I finally again got one of thier attention and ordered off of memory.Food was good but pricey for the size.Also the garlic chicken noodles barely had any chicken in it, but still was good.The atmosphere was ok except for the fact that they had the ac blaring on  57 degree night.I got so uncomfortably cold I had to leave.It was warmer outside.No need for ac when its less than 60 degrees outside.Service did get a little better when the crowd thinned out, but overall it was a pretty annoying experience.Definately not worth the headache."

yGMCl0vYigshkXiZFIDTNw,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,1,"Ugg the service and food was just awful.Last time i ate here it was good,but last night was ridiculous.The server was rude and apathetic.She moved at the pace of a turtle,never smiled or showed any interest in how our food tasted.She let us sit with empty drinks for 10 minutes. i have never seen such a poorly run restaraunt in all my life.IT was not busy,and food took forever,along with everything else.When my chicken finally arrived,it was stringy and undercooked.I dont know how they managed to not cook my chicken properly,since i waited a half an hour for it.when we left the clueless manager was sitting on her butt at the bar,smiling and waving goodbye,like she thought everything was a o.k.I will never eat here again.the only good thing was the bread, which they are very stingy with the portion size."
vKKSF1_1JNnRMaoNPQb5Lw,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,1,"I dont get why people wait hours to eat here.The food is average at best.It is also kinda pricey.The restaurant is so small that you're packed in there like sardines. I literally felt claustrophobic eating there.There is always a wait of 1 to 2 hours even during the day.Food takes forever, like an hr wait after ordering.Also the restaurant seems to be badly managed.Ie, rude hostesses, one server with too many tables to handle, while other servers are standing around looking bored.the pizza is pretty bland too."
cCX_cpuuzTI3lDUyKFCnAg,axR0oeEoCfWD61VbV4Qohw,2,"I have always liked the food there.better quality  than taco hell the issue is with the terrible service I got in the drive through. es.they have 99 cent tacos.which is the only reason I stopped there on a tuesday.I was greeted rudely
Literally ya I'll b w u in a min.int a rude tone.it   this was at 1150 pm.well after sitting in silence for 10 15  mins.I was deemed worthy to place my order,4 tacos.when I pulled up to pay,the charged me full price!so I said its ""taco tues."" 99 cents a piece.to which the rude snot face teen said in a condenscending tone""uhhh todays wed.which made me question if I had my days wrong.after thinking n checking calendar I realized  it had been wed.for all of 10 minutes.and I had tried to place my order at 1150  but was left waiting to order for 15 mins.when I explained this to worker,he could care less and shrugged.very unprofessional.so I paid  full price for something that should've been half the pice. I wanted to complain to manager but was  in a hurry the douche working there is a lil punk.I suspect he made me wait just so he can act like a douche.(on  a power  trip).I work in a restaraunt n the rule is if you're ready to order,the time u pull up should be counted.not the long time it took to be acknowledged. I will never go here again.I don't need rude service."

Got dragged here a couple of times by a group of friends.the hostesses were nice and friendly,the decor was laid back,the food and service was just awful though.the beer tastes like it came out of dirty taps.it was skunky and gross.waited 15 mins.for server to waddle over to us.she mustve thought she was hot stuff because she had on a really short skirt and was about oh....60 lbs.overweight.gross!good if your on a diet I guess.she acted like it was a privelage to be served by her.as she was too busy talking to co workers in the middle of taking our order.the food was greasy and mediocre.the grilled chicken tastes frozen and is full of fillers.my friend said the wings were good though.the cliental consists of loud, drunk,demanding old people.we got stuck next to a group of like 10 of them and everytime any server walked by they demanded something loudly and rudely.I was shocked to see that every server dropped what they were doing to cater to these gereatrics.it really affected our service along with other peoples who were sitting near us.then later that night they had live music.it was just some stuck up hipster with an acoustic playing the same tired old cover songs we've all heard a million times before,mixed with his desperate need for attention by chatting up the drunks at the bar loudly over the microphone.the music/cries for attention were soooo loud we couldn't even carry on a conversation without screaming at each other.the whole scene was just annoying."

The service was great'as was our pizza.the decor was cool.lots of t.v.'s and very  clean.the only thing that I didn't like was the overzealous managers coming to our table asking us if everything's o.k. several times by several different managers.ANNOYING!!!!! We also could hear them yelliing at their employees while they were in the kitchen.very unprofessional.felt bad for our server because she did an excellent job,but her managers were  loudly barkimg orders at her'and everyone else there.geesh! Glad I don't work there. Id probally come back for pizza sometime,but don't like to frequent establishments tjat treat their workers  poorly so  I doubt i'd become a regular."

Besides that, the restaurant isn't sure what it wants to be.  Limited menu.  Unhealthy choices (duck fat fries?)  I got the lamb burger for $14.  Are you going to be a gourmet restaurant or have a variety of items and prices on the menu?
From the name, I expected pulled pork sandwiches and the like.  But none was to be found.  It really needs to figure out what it's going to be.  And fix that sewer smell!"
t_J_ykCkOkZPlmlJuDnkzg,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,4,"Resurrected from the closed Chuy's.  Almost exactly the same.  Walk in, order at the bar.  Self serve chips bar with salsa and shake.  Local crowd at the bar.  Everything that Chuy's was.  Even down to the roll of paper towels on every table.  The only difference I noticed was that instead of a stuffed animal to give you for your order (as a marker for the server), now it's a numbered small orange cone.

Love the mesquite salmon dinner with mex rice and beans.  Good place to catch a game on one of the many TV's.  Sort of a Mexican/Mesquite/Sports/Local hang out.

Recently had the large nachos.  Awesome!  Huge.  I could not eat a thing after finishing it!"
gE07l6v5mp5TPM4awcm5Xg,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,4,"Great burgers and salads.  Both about $10 bucks, but the burger is 10 oz.  Try and find that anywhere.  Nice waitresses and I've heard the wings are good too.
Overall, a good place to watch the game.  The bar seems to be filled with regulars."
jqv3JbLv6K9Sgukf5fijOw,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,3,"Do not be confused by the name.  This is a Native New Yorker restaurant/sports bar.  It's a brand new set up, and must be part of their attempt to rebrand and upgrade their look..  TV's all over the place.  Wings, pizza, burgers.  What Native is famous for.  Great place to watch the games.
Had a burger and fries.  Good.  Only complaint:  the ventilation system wasn't on all the time and seemed to come on full blast with AC.  So you'd freeze for a while and then it would go off.  This is the winter (right now).  So I can imagine it will be a great cool place in the AZ summer.  But ladies, bring a hoodie for when the AC comes on!"
HVyxN-G8NOfUHo2cEnilVw,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,4,"Love this place.  Pick up a stainless steel bowl, fill it with your meat, then veggies, then seasonings and sauce.  Bring it to the grill.  Awesome with brown rice as the starch.  They do have gluten free sauces and options.  Healthy as you want to make your dish.
They use canola oil (not the best, but much better than soybean oil!).
Great place and you make it the way you want it."
4CdqGdbYBjRCyvUDx7ppYQ,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,5,"This was without question, the BEST $7 organic salad I've had to date.  (No protein)  They let me substitute other ingredients when I omitted some.  Unlike other places that just give you less of a salad, this one was awesome and filling.
And the price was right for organic too!

This is my second visit.  Awesome salads both times!  First time there though, they did have a major fishy smell, but it seems to be gone now!  Yeah!"
OwZM33ZI8LZVknaLICWIhw,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,4,"Reasonable prices.  Some Mediteranian restaurants will charge you $3 extra if you don't want all rice and want to do half a salad, But at the ZK, half and half is the standard, and for about $10.  I did a lamb and all rice dinner.  The lamb was ""buttery"" which hopefully was ghee and not seasoned with herbs the way most do it.  The rice is awesome although I have been there a couple of times and once got a little bit of saffron rice on top, and the second time got a lot. Definitely had a good experience, and worth the money.
Not much for ambiance, but hey, I was there for the food."
2OkYkQRItlqbKw9Mz7flCA,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,3,"Been here for years.  They have the BEST NACHOS in Phoenix.  If you're in the mood for a huge helping of chips, cheese, jalapenos, and all the rest, this is the place to come!
This is all I ordered and could not eat anything else for hours."
yNBVOKSZN_AIjSJdhF_rqA,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,1,"First visit to Garbanzo's.  Was not impressed.  Food looked like it was sitting for quite a while.  They try to play it as ""healthy"" but there are so many Med restaurants in the area that just absolutely clean their clock.
The use ""non-hydrogenated"" oil (canola) to deep fry.  But when you look at the ingredients for their salad dressings and sauces, they have ""hydrogenated soybean oil"" in just about everything.
Not healthy, not fresh, and not impressed.  Everything looks like it comes right out of a plastic bag from some corporate office.  Definitely not a Chipolte!"
CV0knwCFA-x-8jJHot6Few,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,2,"I don't get all of the great reviews.  Yes, the owner is constantly there, that's nice, but its the food that counts.  I did not try any of the soups, which I hear are very good, but if I had to sum up the dish I did get it would be PLAIN.
I got the steak kababs with rice and tomato.  The steak is seasoned with salt and pepper.  That's it.  The rice has ""vegetable oil"" and some ""vegetable seasoning"".  That's it.  No Ghee, no saffron.  The tomato wasn't even grilled, just sliced.  The portion of rice was good, but there were only about 5 small pieces of steak.  All this for 9.99.  I think it was the most expensive item on the menu, and certainly not impressive."
APXWKd1N-COyUdncd_FdyQ,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,5,"A definite hidden GEM!  Loved this place!  Owner and his wife there and run it.  All stuff made from scratch.  Uses the healthiest ingredients he can find and he will tell you them if you have any allergies.  Makes his own BBQ sauces.
Had the special, a half beef and half pulled pork burger.  Fries were hand cut.  Awesomely seasoned.  Definitely worth your while to find this place as it's kind of in no-mans's land (Cave Creek south of Greenway).  But worth the trip!"
2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,4,"Love this place, but let's get the prices and days straight.  They are CLOSED on Monday.  Tues-Thurs the lunch buffet is $9.99.  Fri $11.99.  Sat/Sun $12.99.
I haven't noticed a difference in the food selection on either day, but maybe I'm missing something.
First thing I like:
The have real Basmati white rice.  Tasty.
Next:
The always have a good selection of soups and dishes on the buffet although lately, haven't seen any goat curry, only fish.
The bad:
Usually I go later, around 2 and the tea is either out or cold.  The paneer can also be gone.  I guess I have to get my act together and get there earlier!"
_E6j0AVb3lkLBLzvPHInXA,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,3,"I like the concept.  Roll fresh ""Angus"" beef into meatballs every AM.  Smash them just before cooking.  But in reality, all beef is Angus.  It's the most popular type of cattle in the US.  And they must use the lowest fattiest (85%?) cut because the burgers are greasy.  And they come in either 5oz or 7oz patties.  Got a small smash and a side salad.  The salad was OK.  Burger with lettuce wrap had no wrap.  Just lettuce and tomato on the side.  So I had to eat my burger off the plate.  And it was greasy.  So not sure what to make of SB.  May try it again, but with In and Out so close, it's tough to make the move to SB.  If only In and Out had sweet potato fries!"
Kykw3ho8wHtLV6gr9qbWTg,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,2,"Great, a restaurant that serves organic and gluten free!  But wait.  Sat at the bar, ordered an organic salad.  Came with mixed greens, a small cucumber, some shredded carrots and every other ""add on"" was minuscule.  The dressing was supposed to be olive oil, garlic and lemon juice.  No lemon taste what so ever.  Just garlic.  Like ""burn your mouth"" garlic.  AND the mixed greens had several ""old and bad"" sections that I had to pull out.  Shouldn't the cook have done this before he served it if the greens weren't fresh?  Bottom line, expensive ($15 with tax and tip) and not huge portions of the organic veggies.  I could have bought a bag of organic greens at Trader Joes for 3 bucks and had the same thing!"
IAqyeVG1ZMrv7hiV3FAB6Q,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,5,"This is the best chinese buffet in North Phoenix.
Pros:  They have a sushi chef.  Try finding that anywhere.  They have all the regular dishes you'd expect at a chinese buffet.  Good quality and hot.  Cheap.
Cons: Limited on the salads.  Sometimes, something that looks like a salad or just plain lettuce.  The front door hasn't been cleaned since 1962.  The men's room urinal has had a black plastic bag on it since I've been going there for 3 months.  (Come on, fix the damn thing).  Both bathroom doors have not been cleaned since, well you get the idea.
Overall, I drive past a couple of other Chinese buffets to get here.  It's worth the trip."
cKRMmytHxaSt8F0SMEzKqg,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,3,"A-OK, but on the expensive side.  I did get the 8.99 nachos with shredded beef and they were awesome!  Huge.  Should not have polished off the entire plate, but couldn't help mystelf!  Better as an appetizer for 2 or more.
Was talking to a fellow customer next to me and he agreed that they are expensive and other Mexican restaurants are just as good and cheaper."
G8k2E3oYHHl2o4lNJQwR-g,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,4,"Love Eden's Grill.  Great basmati rice, all yellow which I'm hoping is ghee.  (unfortunately, I found out from the owner that it is saffron rice with ""vegetable oil"".  This usually means ""soybean oil'.  Since soybean it probably the cheapest and worst oil to use (endrine disruptor), that really makes me not want to frequent the place that often.)

The steak kabobs are awesome, seasoned with some herbs and not totally garlicy or spicy.

Very small place and hard to find in the corner of a shopping center (ACE Hardware) but well worth the trip.  The lunch portions are smaller and cheaper so get there before 4.  One day I was running really late and they had changed to dinner.  Wow, much bigger servings but of course, I ate it all!"
eMnCAvoCsZ3L1UuI4A0Vtw,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,1,"Watch out if you think GC has healthy food.  If you go in and eat only the vegetables, they are soaking in MARGARINE made with hydrogenated soybean oil.  Soy is genetically modified and an endocrine disrupter.  For real butter, you have to ask your server - the ""butter"" they have out is actually margarine.  They use soybean oil for their deep fat frying (but this is not unusual.
I thought it was a good place to go, but the brussel sprouts/carrots/green beans, etc. are all swimming in margarine - which they determined years ago to have massive trans fats and to be worse than butter.
It's good to know that GC will save a few bucks at the cost of their customer's health...."
HVzH8CO3e1-tjr97cF_8LA,uQk-uhTYtXAjcRjKUZkcMg,1,"This could be a great sports bar.  Great place to watch a game.  But the service is just incredibly bad.  Was there during the NFL championship games this past Sunday.  Now these are the two best games of the year, so you'd think the restaurant would be properly staffed.  But NO.  The few waitresses that they had were running there heads off.  Tables sat with plates and checks for almost an hour.  Drinks went unfilled.
I orderd a burger and it came raw.  Not rare, raw.   When I sent it back, it came back raw.  So the service stinks and the cook stinks?  I asked for a new burger.  The waitress immediately said ""what, after you've eaten half of it?""  Obviously, they haven't been trained in customer service. I had to say, ""I've been trying to find a part that was cooked"".
All they needed was an extra ""bus boy"" or two.  Some to clear the tables, refill drinks, take away plates, etc.  But none to be found.  I feel sorry for the waitresses.  It is staffing issues and customer service training.  Do you think they gave me more fries for their screwing up my order twice?  Of course not.  I don't think this place lasts too long.  When an older gentleman came in and was setting up a large table (by himself) I said ""don't expect too great of service today"".  He said, ""oh, it's always like that.  That's not why I come here"".  Enough said."
oO5jC3tOmvIy7JDExKYl2g,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,3,"Take into consideration we visited on a Sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere was flat. Music is ok - every once in a while a good country song would come on but it was hit & miss. Wait staff is also hit & miss - some nice but ours wasn't very proactive in getting waters etc. Drinks are pretty good. Food selection wasn't as good as other places, but it had good flavor - each of us had sirloin steak. If anything is a plus, it wasn't busy at all so we were served quickly. I don't like to use reviews to compare to other restaurants but can't help & compare to TX Roadhouse because they are so close in style and food, but I'd have to say TR edges this one by a slight margin because their staff is more engaged and atmosphere is fun."

At first I thought it would be a tough bite, but it was tender & delicious. Highly recommend. Brady's BBQ sauces on the table are also great on their own."
DzZbZR7zgsho_XM6mhOCZg,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"Like the flavor of the espresso; nice change of pace vs *bucks. Big selection of coffee syrups. Pastries are really good & good selection. They also have a wide variety of cafe breakfast & lunch choices - haven't tried any yet so can't rate the food though.
Also, on a hot day try the ice toddy with your favorite syrup, it's a great way to go!"
Bqa0TLWAU5ALFrWnuT8E0w,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,3,"Love the food here but this location is rarely ever staffed well so it takes a long time to get your food, especially weekend mornings. So if you're in a rush in the morning, you may want to pass. Downside is that there's not a lot of good breakfast places around here so I can't offer an alternative."
aCkAmpBmEJCeRBJ5_Q2D-Q,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,4,Great service. Food was pretty good. Love the crust on the pizza. Dessert was also delicious. Table shared a cookie sundae & it was very sugary sweet but we enjoyed it.

w2gXToEf9ba78Qfmp42YRQ,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"Just had a great experience so had to write about it. Stopped for drive thru lunch & it was super fast. I believe the manager was helping run the window & she was friendly, yet in full control of operations. She caught the fact that we asked for a special order that wasn't done right & had it corrected before serving the food. Even with the remake the check out speed was far faster than any other Chik Fil A location & most other fast food chains."
5kafliYagjermFOJEoaSYw,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,4,Pretty good teriyaki chicken if you're in a hurry. Been here a few times & they've had great customer service. They were literally faster than the Starbucks next door where I only bought a simple latte.
vrKcFQPxj1Zzyj93yl-t6g,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,1,"Tried to go to Top Golf for the first time today. As we made our way up the steps this morning with a driver in hand we were stopped mid way by what looked like a Manager (I purposely say ""stopped"" vs ""greeted"" because her demeanor was nasty). She berated me & my daughter like naughty children - keep in mind I'm middle aged.  The associate was unapologetic when she proceeded to say, and I quote ""There's 2 things. Number 1... You cannot bring in your own clubs. Number 2... There's no drinks allowed.""
OK - the whole point of going out this morning was to try out my new driver & spend a father-daughter day with my kiddo. My daughter was carrying an unopened bottle of water, it's not like it was a soda or a bottle of Jack Daniels. Get over it lady.
So to your establishment I say: number 1 - the whole point of a driving range is to practice with the equipment you have to improve your game, so your rule is as ridiculous as telling a bowler they can't bring their own equipment into a bowling alley & number 2 - it's hot in AZ & it's appropriate to carry water with you when playing an outdoor sport.
This place is a racket.
My guess is that they can't trust customers with golf clubs & are worried you're going to steal theirs. Guess what? If you can't figure out how to come up with a process that protects you while allowing people to enjoy the game as its intended to be, you don't deserve to be in business. And while you're at it, next time apologize, even if it's insincere I might not be as tempted to take time out of my day to write a detailed review about a horrible experience that you delivered before I could even get my foot through the door."
mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"We tried the teriyaki chicken and Asian spicy chicken. Both were very good!  If this was located a little closer to us, we'd definitely come back on a regular basis. Wide variety to choose from on the menu including crab puffs, edamame, etc. If I could rate 4.5 I would - the only downside is that it's small inside so not the most welcoming place to eat, but if you want something delicious on the go, this is it."
j0pppFcCeTnmBduZ30gGiA,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,2,"We tried chicken & carne burritos & a salad. Really good flavors across the board. Food itself is fine, no complaints there. Major problem is their service & line setup - it wasn't all that busy the day we tried it and yet they rushed us through the line like there was a fire. I get the fast casual concept, but that was ridiculous! There's no point in pushing people through choices when there was a bottleneck at the cashier and we didn't get our food any sooner had they taken a second to clearly explain options or give us a chance to even see what all toppings are available (they didn't design the queue well and you don't see your options until you're right on top of them). Staff didn't communicate well & just about made the wrong burrito before my family noticed and spoke up. Also they just assumed everyone wanted rice & didn't ask. Price is high too for what you're getting. Chipotle & Costa Vida are superior. Likely won't go back but flavor of the food is the only reason they rank higher than 1 star."
v_ubyYwllvUW1No-hKhsbQ,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,3,"Last couple times we ordered out, the pizza was too greasy. Bummed because when the place first opened it started off great. I think they're just too busy to take time to be mindful of olive oil they're adding or maybe the cheese they're using has changed. I don't know - hard to tell.
I still crave it once in a while, but it's easier to talk myself out of the indulgence knowing how oily it has been lately."
fEL4pMI3cilYHwcSH2ltpQ,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,4,"Tried this location a few times now and they seem to be well staffed, which I really appreciate - food served pretty quickly. Plus, we were happy to find that not only are the subs great but salads are also good, especially for a sub place. Would give it a 5 but they messed up one of our orders."
-CfFjcCcGGDM9MVH_d42RQ,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,A little expensive but food is very good! Staff was friendly and attentive. Nice ambiance.
SIqwJPn603ChWpxneRpVag,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"So far I haven't had a bad experience at any Jimmy John's but this location is exceptional. Been in a few times & staff is very friendly. And of course, super fast. Only downside is you have to be very careful to tell them if you want an ingredient off the sub because they're almost too fast & we had one mistake, but it was no big deal."
jPQxZTuFhuVHsu-DI4hm2A,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"Been going here off and on for many years. This isn't as close to home as it once was, so before today it had been a long time since my last visit. Can't believe how consistently good their teriyaki chicken is!!! If you're looking for healthy options you can get white meat & brown rice; plus they have other low carb options (haven't tried them but they're available).  5 stars all the way!"
D2_y52mbmTrNLHux6aCrIg,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"Great customer service, very friendly. Steaks are good for a value & without the need to dress up. Mix drinks are very good. Not much to complain about - used to be busy all the time with long lines but lately it seems they've figured out how to move people through quicker."
ipFobdM6X_4SNMA9ZBfdAQ,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,3,"Let me start off by saying it pains me to give PJ less than 5 stars. I'm a big fan of Pita Jungle and have been to this location many times but recently it's been a disappointment. Food has been good as expected but clientele at this location, coupled with pretty slow & unfriendly service, has us driving out of our way to go to another location. Place is a hot bed for little kids and babies. I'm not oppose to families w/ little ones - I have one myself, but if you insist on having your kids run around the restaurant and/or cry their heads off please consider a pizza place. On more than one occasion we've ran into this on weekends so it's not a one off situation. When I'm spending that kind of money all I want is a little kick back, relaxing atmosphere & good service, not inconsiderate clueless patrons."
-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,3,"Funky decor; friendly, fast service. Like the casual atmosphere & open, airy dining room which is great on a nice day. Great salsa. If you're looking for untraditional flavors this is the place to go. We ordered carne tacos, quesadilla and chicken salad. Carne was sweet, which was interesting. Chicken wasn't all that great - I would almost score this place a 4 but chicken ruined it."
EUhjQecCVsyxPXE20DFsaw,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"If you're in the mood for seafood, this place never disappoints. Fast, friendly servers. Food is delicious! Rarely has super long wait times, which is nice."
LnIO_JtoDS1xLfTHWuV_ug,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,4,"Salsa is really good, especially if you like it hot. Normally restaurants tone down the hot salsa but not here. Food itself is pretty good, we tried the burritos. Atmosphere is authentic. Service is average, friendly."
g-I48SaHtdIGR5ZEoVeNFw,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,4,"Very good sushi. Service is friendly and fast. Prices are pretty good, basically what you would expect for sushi. They do have some pretty good specials though. Small place so not much to say about atmosphere."
5S4qWTntF4S-JNTbPNyYPw,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,2,"First off, the product itself (coffee, food, etc.) is good, so that's why B.R. gets more than one star. The major issue has always been service and as of today, it's now also the atmosphere.

Service: I'm hesitant coming here when I'm in any kind of hurry. It takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes on avg., even for simple espresso orders. Staff is very friendly so that's a plus, but there's no sense of urgency. I'm ok with the chilled, laid back speed on the weekends but not during the week. I was able to look past that until today...

Atmosphere: it's a mid week morning and the parking lot is packed (unusual for this center). Turns out that it's a bicyclist meet up. Thankfully only a couple riders stopped in for coffee at the time I showed up, so aside from lack of parking spots, it was no big deal at first.

But here's where it rubbed me the wrong way - turns out several cars must have also belonged to a bible study group that commandeered the coffee shop. Nearly all tables were taken, formed into a circle by men reading scripture out loud to each other. I have no problem with people demonstrating their religious preferences, but please don't hold mass in the middle of a small restaurant or retail establishment. It's uncomfortable & annoying. There's not a lot of room, so as a customer, what direction do you look while waiting for your order?
Just so I could avoid looking nosey, I had my back facing them, so I'm sure they had a nice eye level view, given I was practically in their space while waiting. So, should I have watched them awkwardly, like I'm getting into their business? Maybe invite myself into the group? Maybe I should've waited outside?

It seemed like the barista was hesitant to make any noise & had a comical look on his face when he had to chip away at the ice for my drink because the guy leading the discussion started yelling over the noise. After handing my drink over, the barista sheepishly whispered to have a good day.

I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. There was a bottle of RumChata sitting on the coffee bar, while a few feet away a large group of people prayed.
The last small coffee shop that I used to frequent allowed for bible studies in the middle of the shop and they eventually went out of business. I think it's because they had an identity crisis, trying to be both a fun, laid back shop but then it was serious & quiet with the study going on, so you never knew what to expect.

If BR wants to survive, they need to figure out their identity & put a stake in the ground. If they want to be a religious coffee shop, by all means go for it. I have no problem with that. But then put away the RumChata... actually stop selling alcohol altogether. If you want to be a progressive coffee shop, go back to playing Bob Marley.

You can't be everything to everyone or you please no one!"
t61eGISz7qMOxEe7o3vwEw,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"We've tried this place a couple times now & it's been an excellent experience each time. Everything we've tasted has been absolutely delicious. We love the combination of flavors in all of their dishes - if you like butternut squash, pears & bacon, this is the place for you. I highly recommend the green chili mac & cheese. Normally I don't go the mac & cheese route, but it's just the right amount of spice & an elevated dish like you'd expect from 5 star dining. Service is also quick & friendly. Highly recommend."
qAbXHsddBhmfQFegGiV7Dg,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,5,"Been going here for quite a while. Very good teriyaki chicken dishes with excellent sauce  - really hits the spot! Good portions even though it's a little pricey. They've also added sushi to the menu & most of it is great. There was maybe just one sushi roll (I think it was the spicy tuna) that was just ""ok"" but still better than most places. The tempura shrimp and Las Vegas rolls were very good.  They also have a variety of other options like fried rice, brown rice, crab puffs, miso soup, vegetarian dishes, etc. I see a lot of people complain that the restaurant has changed over the years & it's true..it has changed but the food has remained consistently good. I still highly recommend - it's not easy finding a truly great teriyaki place in AZ that's delicious & good portions for the price - usually you sacrifice one for the other."
A26EdvXPLzDXWg0AYVAdAA,edFXHf-eCLhVA3AHbENOYg,4,Been to this location a couple times & the service has been consistently great! Food well prepared & delicious. Recommend the coconut shrimp appetizer. Mixed drinks are a bit weak. If there's one thing that bugs us about Red Lobster it's their decor & atmosphere - very outdated.
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,5,"Oh man let me tell you about this place. I have been here a few times before and they recently started opening for lunch, which might I add was the greatest thing EVER.
We went on a Friday. They open at 11:00 and we were seated right away. within 30 minutes this restaruant was full and there was a wait. Granted there are only about 8-10 (2) seater tables and 6-7 (4) seated tables and maybe 8-10 seats at the bar. Still 30 MINUTES. I do have to say that they have a wine and appitizer bar/house next door for you to sit and mingle while waiting for a seat to open for you.
I got the margherita pizza minus the basil add  prosciutto. Man this is the best pizza I have EVER had. The sause is super simple which is awesome. They cook it in the brick oven pizza stove and when it comes out they put the prosciutto on it. My partmer got the wise guy pizza and added muswhroom. Same thing she always gets, that should tell you how good it is. She also for the daily salad, which was fennel, parsley, watermelon in a light lemony juicy. She said it taste like summer.
I am a pizza fan, like one of those ones that can buy a frozen one from the store and be just as happy with it. So for me to say this is the best, LISTEN PEOPLE.
SIDE NOTE: They do not accept reservations and If you get there in the evening on a weekend you are going to be looking at a 2 hour wait. Trust me though it will be worth it"
dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"WINGS OF GOLD!!!!
I feel that this is all that I have to say about thos place...but I won't.

You must trying the wings of gold. They are these like honey mustard wings that are perfectly fried and covered in the sauce. Some times I think that they use big chicken for their wings cause they are that big.
If you go during lunch you can get pizza and a drink for a pretty good price. Their pizza is pretty tasty too.
Don't like pizza, they also have pasta. The big rig pasta which is one of my farovites. Laso the cheesy garlic bread is MMMMM good too.
I always come back to this place, mainly for the wings but for everything"
6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"Man I love this chicken. Their menu is not huge but man is the chicken good. They marinate the chicken and then grill it. I comes out and is red but that is due to the marinade. It is very tasty and juice. I order the 2 piece chicken plate which comes with beans, salsa, 2 tortillas, chicken and marinated onion. Mmmm so good. I have had the carne asada too before but it was a little dry for me but also had great flavor
This is a CASH only place, so stop before going."
qvQ-i1HgSloSJLkGnXsfhw,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,5,"I must start by saying I only order from this place and have never sat down to eat, but I have been here several times. So if you are looking for a service review you won;t find it here, this is simply on the food itself.

I love this pizza. It is one of my favorite pizzas in town. They are not close to me but I always make the drive to get it. What I love the most about it is the crust. I am a chewy yet crispy kind or crust gal. I love the chewyness of the crust. I love to get a side of ranch and a side of the hot wing sause and dip this pizza in. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just writing this. The wings are damn good too. I always get the hot cause I like the hot ones. They are fried not baked and taste oh so good. I have also had the bbq ones and they are tasty as well."
0NgePUfXd2TG0kWgsQRq0A,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"I love this place. You can pick your meats, veggies, noodles and sauce. You can make it the way that you like it and not feel like you have to pick things out that you don't like.
This is what you do to get the cheapest food ever. So you pay 10.50 for a togo meal. Which includes a drink, soup, rice and your food. Grab and bowl and start piling you food and I mean pile. Basically what fits in you bowl is yours. You usually end up with 2 sometimes even 3 or 4 meals this was. I have seen bowl that make me wonder how that even fits. Anywho..... If you end up with 3 meals then in reality you only paid 3.50 per meal."
fKlr9qNoV37WQJwQ826POg,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,5,"What a great place. Been here twice and thought both times were great. I have to say better this time than last though.
Was sat right away. Starts with this awesome salad bar that has this enormous wheel or parmesan cheese. You flip your red card to green and holy moly! People seem to come from left and right serving you dinfferent kinds of meat, different cuts of meat and different prepared meats. They keep doing this round and round until you turn your card back to red. You can flip it back and forth all night. They also bring out side which consist of garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas, fried polenta with parmesan cheese and cheese popovers all night long. Also at your request they have 3 dipping sauces for the meats. 1 a chimchurry, 2 and house made hot sauce and 3rd a horseradish sauce. All very good. For dessert we order both the chocolate mousse and the tree leches cakes to take home. Both were.very good.
The service was probably the best I have ever had. The entire wait team work together. 1 picks up your plate and within seconds you.have a new one. Same with refills and seconds. This is a place that you never wait on them, they truly wait on you. They are on the pricey side, around 50 smackers for 1 person, so I wouldn't come here every day. But man between the food and the service, it is well worth it"
16fgi4_LNRlPGcpL1ObNww,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"Mmmmm, Finally hit the food truck gathering and tried this place. I am a fan. I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese bites. Yummy. The pors was not dry and covered in bbq sauce like most places to it. It was juicy and tender. The mac and cheese bites were yummo as well, Totally a fan. I would have this place again."
YstdDnNa6h_ms3Ys7Pz4uQ,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"I love this place from start of meal the the end of the meal. They have great salads but I always get the mamas scipy chicken. Chicken, small round noodles, carrots, celery, potatoes to help thicken it, spices to give it a little kick. So good. I then usually get the chicken trio with the garlic mashed potatoes. They cook this chicken on an open flame and gives it the great char taste (char not burnt) and it juicy. The garlic mashed potatoes are really yummy too. Not to much garlic, just right. Of coarse the dessert. Even if there is no room for it I always order it even if I take it home. The called the Sogno Di Chiocclate (chocolate Dream) I am dreaming about just telling you about it. It is for the chocolate lover. It is fudge brownie that has kahlua brushed on it, chocolate mousse, whipped cream and a home made chocolate sauce (that is to die for) all put together. It is the perfect bite."
e-gVqGEtnjEkunvQ5J3uyA,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,5,"This place has the best sandwiches ever and is home of the stop sign pizza.

There is nothing special about the sandwiches but, damn they are good. The fresh italian bread, the juice cuts of meat. This sandwich (the one I get) had italian dressing, mayo, lettuce, tomatoe, no onion turkey, black forest ham and cheese. You also get some pepperchinis on the side. Like I said nothing special, but still there is something about the meat and the fresh brad that totally makes this sandwich.
The stop sign pizza is great for a family or a get to gather. Literally the size of a stop sign. It's like 35ish dollars and you have to pre-order it but it has like 30-40 slices (squared).
Been going here for the past 12 years. I do only get the ham and turkey sandwich and have to admit that I have not had any of the other sandwiches. I do hear that the other selections are good too.
The place may look a little scary, both the neighborhood and the inside. Don't let it turn you off to this place. Give it a try"
BBTkC1Z3ZnEE916SkCONIg,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,5,"This is a great place to eat. I have passed by this place several time and finally stopped in. I am so happy I did. I have to say for as great is this place is, I am surprised it isn't more busy.

I got this chicken, Bacon, avocado panini that was amazing it was called the C square. They use this chibata type bread that is super soft and have this lemon herb aioli that just makes this sandwich it also comes with spinach, cherry tomatoesand blue cheese but I subed that for gouda. It comes with this what seems regular spring salad but it has this Asian dressing that just pushes your plain old spring mix salad to a whole new level.

I will most definitely be going back."
P7j_K9baGxWPlInbjn0OOg,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"This place really surprised me. I was looking on Yelp for something different around my work that I could run and grab. There was also a check in off Yelp for a free side hummus with order. Looked at the menu, called it in. Ordered a chicken shawarma. Got back to work. The free hummus was probably about 3-4 ounces but the bad of pita chips to go with it was like a small brown lunch bag size. I thought to myself, hope that's the size only for the free size and they don't actually charge for that. Way too much chip for the hummus amount. The shawarma was great. I would order this again in a heartbeat."
cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,1,"I am not even to close fan of this place. I read the reviews and was super excited to try something new. This place was super super loud. The music was so load that people were practically yelling to hear eachother. I didn't feel like I could even talk to my partner while here.

I did get seated pretty fast. I ordered the deviled egg dip that was so over salted, I had to send it back. We also order the cheese fondue that is what made me give this place some stars. As the main dish, I ordered the Windsor Burger that was just okay. Nothing really to get excited about. It wasn't and isn't something to even remember.

Definitely not coming back or suggesting this place to any friends."
S6TMBqrsi4PLRFoQFPScjQ,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"I am not a vegan, far far from it. I couldn't be a vegan if I wanted to cause I hate most veggies.  My partner is a vegan however and I am always willing to try anyhting once. The meat-less meat actually has the texture of meat not mush.
I get the original ""G"". It is a buffalo meat-less chicken between two pieces of bread with tomato, lettuce, buffalo sauce, and some mayo like something as well. I get the french fries with this. I actaully crave this damn sandwich now. It is spicy so if you are not a spicy eater I would not suggest to get it. If you like spicy this might be the perfect thing for you. The fries are awesome as well. Shoe sting cut, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Mmmmmm. Just writing this make me want it. I also get the egg-less eagrolls. These are yammy as well."
r8hVqm9DeasZ0Bf2KMhbeg,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"Been back since my last review and order something different. I was a super fan this time. It was one of there Spanish/Maxican breakfast plates. It was really good. I had a friend tell me once that the Mexican breakfast dishes were not good, I guess that it depends on you and eater. I would return and order this same breakfast again."
ept9mIlqGIsemr6w0RczaA,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,4,"I love this place. The service however is a hit or miss. Either you are going to get great service or your service it going to suck butt and it never really matters if they are busy of not.
Their hummus is smooth and creamy, so very tasty. I always get the grilled chicken pita. I love this thing, probably the reason why I always get it. My partner is a vegan and this is a great place if you are eating vegan.
Ask for Jenna if she is in, you won't be upset about the service."
oMBNvB6tHlwW3UwGBYqljw,jIlbndTaH6bhOYyIGJFL2g,3,"I haven't been to this place in years and was finally working in the area. Got the same thing I always got every time I have gone. I have to say this wasn't as great as I remember. My chicken was pretty dry. And my side salad didn't come with any dressing on it. I also remember the dressing being a more orange-ish Ginger tasting. This was a more white-ish onion tasting. Not a huge fan.
The service was as great as I remember and the people were just as nice as I remember too."

Their cajun fries are good (and please note their ""small"" size is not small at all). You select all your toppings when you order (tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, BBQ or A1 sauce, etc). If you haven't tried one of their burgers, don't pass this place up."

This business could be fantastic but it's not. So I've decided their crepes are not worth a 45 minute wait. If you decide to go, I'd walk straight to the cash register and submit your order. That should shave off about 20 minutes."

The fundido (steak) was good, as long as I didn't think about how many miles I'd have to run afterwards to counteract it. I'm a huge dessert fan and their deep fried ice cream was not something I'd order again (this is where they lost the most points with me).

AtSEe-B2mFmLFHBf4PLTrw,bv6M-zBHexwWBiIz-DFK3A,4,I've been here about 10 times and the food always satisfies. I personally enjoy their egg sandwiches (their Spicy Chipotle egg sandwich was awesome) and I usually pick up a baked good for dessert (raspberry croissant). Sometimes seating can be hard to find weekend mornings though. They also have a little sidewalk patio for those who prefer the outdoors.
_9vGmNrEcLWFOnUzeUdfag,bv6M-zBHexwWBiIz-DFK3A,5,Great BBQ restaurant. Nice laid back feel and awesome food that makes me want to dance when it hits the tongue. I have yet to be disappointed. Eat here!
jb7pFtM4J5Hu9tCaoGxnRQ,bv6M-zBHexwWBiIz-DFK3A,3,"Quite a scenic location, and that's what you are mostly paying for. I could see taking a date here or maybe some out-of-town visitors but I would not make it a regular breakfast or lunch dining spot. It was nice to see the gallery with local artists' work."
VxgjMl8tQrT4idJW_z8daA,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,4,Probably the best chain Italian out there right now. Good overall meal. Try the porkchops! Not on the menu.
-vCLrTTgw6pBufdarW8ynA,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,4,"Fantastic Happy Hour here. I like the various sauces they have available for your meats.

Not a BBQ expert but this is definately one of the best in town."
UYJLWDj_jytplZEkjPe6sg,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,3,"Had a $50 gift card to eat here and it's been burning a hole in my wallet for a year. We always hated this place last time we ate here was 11yrs ago.

I'd say they have drastically changed things. Their new Polenta crusted steak and Raviolis were actually very very good. Lasagna not bad either!

I'd say not quite Carabbas chain quality but it's decent for a chain. Deserves the 3.5 star IMO"
3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,4,"This place has a great vibe. Awesome Pizzas, decent sandwiches and very enjoyable and friendly servers. Especially the blonde girl working the coffee counter with freckles.

We will be back and consider us new regulars."
IBshKrdO914zw5sm8kgfPg,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,4,"Outstanding sandwiches!

Found this place because its in the parking lot of my favorite taco stop. Finally decided to pop in.

Ordered 2 sandwiches, asked the girl to give me 2 of her favorite things, to go. Not disappointed in the least bit.

Some chicken sandwich thing and some nice steak sandwich which looked like it had 4 nice big pieces of what appeared to be Tri Tip in it.

ALL GOOD!!

Dont have the names of what we ate because I literally have no idea. Will go back and sit down next time and try something else. This place is very small, not much for indoor seating from what I could tell.

Staff seemed sterile but then again, I was just picking up. I still judge places on things like that. I expect staff to say hello or offer a water to someone while they wait. Is that too much to ask? I dont think so.

Will definately go back!"
925GiWzJ_cxQaUT870xW7A,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,1,"The place is a nice speakeasy well hidden in downtown scottsdale with some interesting beers in the bottle.

This is where it ends.

The part that REALLY rubbed us the wrong way is 2 things.

1. The bar staff, chose to congregate right in front of us at the bar and chat all about various girls around the bar! ""oh man those are definately D's, but probably fake""..""did you see that one in the corner with the great ass?""

I mean come on!!! We are a couple, show some respect for your patrons!!!

Unreal.

2. The other main complaint here is all of the best seats in the bar have a sign on them that says ""reserved for bottle service"". Give me a break. This is why we sat at the bar.

We won't be back."
4pKPiKAX9qm8TU-bOt7Pmw,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,1,"Could not be sadder to post this review.

We ate here tonight for my birthday. We had a 13yr old, a senior and 2 middle aged folks.

Senior and 13yr old order from the $39 menu and we ordered a couple of wonderful Delmonicos like we always do.

Our steaks were great. The others were horrible. The senior did not want to send it back because she just isn't that way. The Childs needed to go back. It was dry and tough and horribly over flavored with Morrells.

By the time her replacement dish came we were all done and ready for dessert. Waitress just said ""I'll just wrap it up"". What like she shouldn't eat?!!?

Anyway long story short is it was horrible service and they did not even offer to remove one of the awful meals.

Very disappointed in Capital Grille. This location anyway. The one in Ft Lauderdale was always great. The North Scottsdale one ruined my birthday and failed with terrible service and an absent manager.

Booo!

Since this is our neighborhood Capital Grille I would assume eventually we will have to try it again another day and I hope to god come back here and edit this review."

Make better at home.

The coffee is good however as is the ambience."

Love the pizza at ths place so much I even had my birthday party there. Simply outstanding.

Never had anything other than the pizza and a sausage sub here, also wings. I'd say the sandwiches are about average and the wings are really hit or miss.

Go here for the plain cheese
Pizza!!!"
vMnB2Cz3c1Io1IEyeLLVOA,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,4,We eat a ton of Thai and this place is consistently good for American style Thai food. I'm a Thai trained cook and know good Thai! This is decent with a super friendly owner. The way any Thai restaurant should be.

axi57Y3h5c8BxM1Xyj0KBw,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,3,"Pretty pizza with very average taste. This is no comparison to their NY counterpart which is no doubt only related in name.

Another issue with this place is the cooks handling all the pizza dough and ingredients with BARE hands! Gross!"

Itsndelicious."

Second time. No owners, soggy pizza, sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can. Also serving cold Zeppoles is unacceptable!!

Consistency might be an issue with this place."
9Q1ZtzTPFWG4fJiFSko5Xg,T-eaRngYr08qpllS_gJMzw,1,"Absolutely blown away by the good reviews on ths place!! We spent $65 on a meal and drinks here and quite simply wished we hadn't.

The best thing was the guacamole they make at your table.

The bartender was a pretencious and less than desireable human to be around.

Not much else to say...skip!!!"
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,2,"I'm still looking for a GREAT burger.  I cant find one.  Ill review ZinBurger next.

This place is okay.  The fries are good, burger is good...

I'm just looking to be WOWed.  Also... The burgers didnt have many options.   No list of anything fancy or unexpected.  Just a pretty standard burger.

Oh but the fries are served in a mini shopping cart, so thats just sooooo cool, that it makes up for everything else being just so-so...

Wait, no... my mistake... the fries delivery system doth not make up for an otherwise Meh experience.   NEEEEEEXT!"
MgHWbwuxxb_txhI3lK_bKg,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,2,"The Meh Ingredient...

TMI caught my eye a few times as i drove down 7th st, so i made it a point to stop in and check out the joint.

A friend and I arrived after work.  It was about 6pm on a Thursday, so the happy hour crowd should be there.  Surprisingly enough, there were only 2 other tables of people there... This, my friends, is a bad sign.

But hey, i'm a craft beer fan, I love me some ALE... and this is an Ale House, so i'm about to be in heaven, right.... ahem... right??

Well, for an Ale House, the beer selection leaves a LOT to be desired.  First of all, if it's an Ale House, the staff should know a thing or two about beer, which they don't.  Don't go there and count on a good suggestion or description of the brews.  If you want a good beer selection, go to Roosevelt's or Lost Leaf.  TMI pales in comparison.

As for the food... we sampled the Olives, which are... well, olives.  But the olive selection at Postino's is far better.  Something about citrus zest in the olives just doesnt work for me.

Then we had the Pro-Pasto board. The menu advertises ""a sampler of meats, cheeses and veggies.""  Well, I love a mystery, so we take the chance.  As we sipped our beers, the waitress arrived with the board of pro-pasto... she sets it down and walks away.  Wooooah, hold up sister!  What the hellzobah is even on this board?  How about a little rundown?  Oh, I see, this is a little quiz for me?  Cute!  Actually, this server has no idea what's on the board either.  Fortunately it was so unimpressive, that we could clearly make out the provolone & salami... glorious.  They don't know much about the beer, nor the food.   Off to a great start here.

It's advertised as a ""cafe"" and not a ""restaurant"", so i cant complain much about the weak menu (only offering sandwiches).  But if your staple is going to be the beer... then for heavens sake, have a better selection.  Not that the beers were bad, but they are available just about anywhere.  EVERYONE carries Four Peaks, and its not even a great brewery.  They did have an Oskar Blues brew from Lyons CO, but only the Gordon, no DPA.  Not even one Dogfish Head in a bottle.

If your taps are going to be lackluster... Id recommend these TMI people take a little class trip up to Total Wine on camelback and stock the fridge with some bottles of good stuff.  While yer up there, how about reading some lables and taking a class.  Learn a thing or two about beer... or at least about Ale's.

That's my $0.02. Not sorry aBOUT it.  Yer lucky my tip was more than that."
iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,4,"Seeing as how i work about 14 seconds away from this place, I'm here a few times per week.  The menu is pretty good.  Lots of TVs.  It was awesome for World Cup Soccer this summer, great for Baseball all season and packed for Football in the fall.  Great patio... nice fire pit in the fall.

The best part about the half moon is the staff...  Chelsea, Liz, Candy & Courtney behind the bar are absolutely fantastic.  The servers are all also excellent.

Thanks to the ladies at Half Moon for making this bar better than average."
8Zqh2jwtncA3N4fWEMTvZQ,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,4,"After a long night of drinking, ScrAMble is a great little b'fast spot!  I like the style where you order on the way in and they bring it to you.  This is a MUST when i am very hung over.  I just cannot handle waiting 30 min for a table and then another 40 min for food with the sounds of silverware slamming against ceramic plates.... not when im this hungover.  :-/  The only drawback is that they dont have cocktails, and sometimes i really need a bloody mary.

Scramble's food is great and affordable.  Dog friendly patio and good coffee.    Do it up sunnyslope."
8Zqh2jwtncA3N4fWEMTvZQ,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,4,"The Santa Fe Benedict rocks ! Honestly this is the only thing ( besides Bacon) that I ever order here. Who can say no to thick cut apple wood smoked bacon REALLY .
Don't be afraid of the Santa Fe Benedict description, it is flavorful NOT spicy.  The cornbread bottoms have a hint of Jalapeno and the sauce has just a hint of spice. It is truly a desert classic.  The dog friendly patio is a plus. And the mountain views are to die for.  You can grab a quick hike or horseback ride right around the corner. It's a really neat little neighbohood place"
wJY74R0zAgjxvBf-d4gm9g,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,4,"I have been there twice now.  First time sat at a high top booth table next to the window. This visit we sat at the comfy couched closer to the pool  table area. Both were really comfy and inviting.  The place is decked out for Christmas.
Couldn't stop myself from having the cheese board again !! It was soooooo good and BIG. This time our waitress was Ashlynn and she was awesome fitting lunch into our time constraint.  Also tried the mac and cheese with bacon it made my friends taste buds sing, but was a little too rich for me. Great shared item though.  Too bad we didn't have time to have some wine or dessert.  We will sure to be back when we have longer to stay."
7MeMGh0SUlF-GuTyruwtcw,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,"This is a frequent lunch spot for me.  Check out coupon sites, as they frequently have something running.  The service is always great and with a smile.  The gluten free options are clearly marked and yummy !! Lots of great drink options beer and wine.
Be sure to check out the local specials , that's normally what I have.  But can't go wrong with the jerk chicken any time of year.  Be sure to leave extra time for some items like pizzas since they take a little longer to prepare.  This location is on the north side of the street  in the Norterra shopping center.  It's EAST of I 17 so be sure to turn at the light before the traffic circle or you will have to go ALL the way around again !!!"
M8Co6Z9U7bPke7Xq9fFRBg,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,"not sure i am happy with the new staff and owner , but so far no decline in food quality. they have changed the menu a little. my favorite creamy chicken is no longer offered in a grilled version since the chicken is now purchased pre sliced so they cant grill a breast for it anymore. it hasn't effected their great curry dishes though!!! still will go back"
hTsZSiftorNUFb1VaHCHHg,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,4,"Omg this place is the cutest little neighborhood joint.  Somehow reminds me of some of the little places that used to be along the train line in Chicago.  Maybe its the decor or the narrowness of the place , I cant really put my finger on it.  It just really doesn't feel like your in Phoenix.

The welcome was warm and inviting.  The service was great.  Everyone was more than happy to explain menu items to us and make suggestions.

We ordered The meat and cheese platter to start, it was all sooo good we were fighting over it.  we had both the Funghi pizzas white and red.  We definitely liked the red one better.  Nothing was wrong with the white one, maybe we just weren't big fans of seafood on pizza.  The owner took it off of our bill , we hadn't even eaten one piece of it .  The winner of the night was chicken Marsala .  So good it was everyone's favorite.

We loved the place.  It's not cheap, we will be back for happy hour for sure.."
z_dSEPKwDL9Vtw1LrAAHWQ,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,4,went there for a bday party. it was a great new experience to sit at the pour your own tap table. check it out is was different and great. you wont find anything else like it in town
PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,"This is my first time there. Had breakfast pasta and fez burger, loved the half off bottles of wine on sunday. The food was excellent but the service was poor. Had to go back to the host to tell them we had not seen a server yet after 20 min. Will go back again since the food was so good and I had a hard time deciding what to order. Stay tuned"
GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,agree the tikka masala has gone a little thin in the past few months . will only go here on a lunch hour so i can order the special and get a good value. last trip 4 people had lunch and a 2 had a glass of wine and it was $ 100 since everyone ordered ala carte too steep for the amount of food you get.

Just look at the decor.  They have a good selection of food and drinks ( adult and non ) My fav was the mango smoothie.

We were there with a big group and it was pretty crowded, but everybody kept their cool we all got our orders.
The regular menu look fab and I cant wait to come back here to try the rest of what  they have to offer"
4-Ub64zwqopWZeOFsTYTzA,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,"Meeting some friends for dinner, they live in Whitman. Looks cute from the outside. It is at the back of a very busy shopping center so if you don't know the area, you will have to search a little for it.

We were greeted when we arrived. The waitress took our drink order quickly . We ordered Chicken Satay as that typically takes a bit of time to prepare.  We ordered 4 entrees.

The chicken used for the Satay was not well trimmed of fat, but it tasted ok.
Emperor Shrimp (hot )was beautiful looking and delicious, My friend could not finish it by himself.
Drunken noodles also got a rave, though she did not expect a thick wide noodle. I don't normally order this so I wouldn't know what kind of noodle should be in it.

Hubby and I both had curries Panang and Musaman chicken both ordered medium heat . They were both very good and the heat level seemed right on. The only thing I would suggest would be that they cut the chicken and potatoes smaller.

A good time was had by all, the waitress checked on us frequently enough to keep out tea and water filled. I would definitely return and recommend this place."
UC2J3v00-n8WE34BGs2HEw,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,2,"I really wanted this place to be great, and maybe they could be. My group had multiple items on this visit, and they were all terrific value for the money.  The food and drink specials are great here.  It's in Whole Foods so how could you go wrong ??

Let me say BOTH cheese / meat  platters, meatloaf dinner, Tots and wine /beer selection were all above average.

Here's my issue, the service was awful.  I don't mean a little slow either.  We had to flag down a waiter AFTER putting all 3 empty wine and water  glasses at the end of the table trying to get attention.  And this is also AFTER I have gone to the bar  ( 4 tenders to maybe 12 patrons ) to explain that we need to sit at a low table ie. far from the bar since my friend is in a cast and can't sit at the high tops.  I was assured that was fine.  When we ordered , we told the waiter we had other friends on the way, but when they arrived no one came to take their order. Again we had to stop a waiter and explain that we needed more food and drink.
I'm not sure what the business model for this place is, but they should know that empty glasses ( water or wine) means lost money any way you look at it.

I will probably visit here again, since I shop at Whole Foods.  But I wont bring friends until their service improves"
CKoDbOpF_CSyy6_lttqjKg,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,"OK one word DUH .......... "" great views""  guess the joke is on me !!! The ultimate joke bomb.  Yes the view is awesome , very distracting actually.  The girls are HOT and were all wearing tiny variations of Santa and elf costumes. They were all very sweet and friendly, explained the menu offered to let us sample beers.  ( this was my first time there )

I'm absolutely in LOVE with their beer Dirty Blonde, it's a great Hefe with just enough sweetness to it. They are serious about their beer being COLD ! 29 F to be exact,  I can't wait to come back in the middle of the summer.  That beer is going to be sooooooo good on a 115 degree day.

I had the green chile meatloaf with mac and cheese.  Also a quesadilla with chili . Both were really good, not your typical bar food.

The service was great throughout and we had a terrific time.  They have stolen me away from Tilted Kilt forever !!"
g_6gQKZxj9HHbTa1OaUtnQ,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,4,hotter than most.  they speak a little english here but nothing is lost in translation . great Tom KA Gahi spicy and sweet great stuff. prob the best panang in town

We arrived in the rain after being told on the phone that the kitchen was still serving on a weeknight around midnight.  They were in fact still serving the entire menu.  We ordered sliders and pretzels with beer mustard.  And of course beers.  They were both good standard bar food served with a smile.  They had a band playing and some kind of game club playing cards. Everyone seemed to be having a great time.  Including me and the 2 others with me.  There were obviously many locals here ( some in their pj's)  How could the neighborhood folks be wrong !!!"
L2p0vO3fsS2LC6hhQo3CzA,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,5,"First off , never had a bad meal here. Old or new location.  The new place has the same feel , just bigger and cuter !! Still the same old hassles of downtown parking but that's the norm. We both had eggs Benedict at this visit and it was awesome.  I rarely get to visit Matt's since the wait is so long.  So given the chance to walk right in and sit down on a weekday was such a treat.  The waitress was friendly and bubbly as all of them are.  If you haven't been to the new location , go check it out."
gugN1sgyheBJ6aKtNcv_gQ,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,5,"Oops we ate some of them before the pic. Can't resist the bacon ! OK I get it , bacon is good in everything. BUT really get the bacon flight, that's what I said bacon FLIGHT. Many thick cut bacon's , maple , pecan, jalapeno, just to name a few
I'm kind of ashamed to say that when my hubby got a call from work I couldn't stop myself from eating his portion.

They also have the best biscuits and gravy that I've ever tasted.  The Benedict is also good as well as the pancakes.  Good coffee too.

The service has always been great even when the place is packed.  Try to get there early if your going on the weekend, that's your best bet for not waiting a long time."
kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,"Went to the International Supper Club UYE for November.  I had never been there before and didn't know what to expect.  I didn't love everything we had but I did like most of it and loved a coupe things.  That's the benefit of going with a bunch of friends,you get to try more items.

For me, I normally won't order fish in an unknown restaurant .  BUT the mango grilled fish was one of my favorite items !  I was surprised to say the least.  The curry soup was also on the love list for me, even though some others were not crazy about it.  Such is life, taste is subjective just like art.  The egg rolls had a very interesting list of ingredients including black mushrooms so I couldn't resist that, and I loved them.

I will say that the managements recommendation that we eat ""family style"" was the right call.  The small kitchen there is not able to bring out 10-12 entrees at a time.  We were happily munching on one or two platters at a time while they were cooking the next ones. So don't let that scare you away if your going with a group"
EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,4,"Happy Hour is a must.  Get here before 7pm. Entrance is in the back.   The items ( non happy hour ) are a little pricey. But that being said, everything we had was AMAZING.
Now it's very dark in the bar area, and I thought the menu was a little hard to decipher for a first timer.   Once the waiter explained what the different sections of the menu were I was with the program.  So everything on one side of the menu is small items. Like small bites or app. fare. The other side (right side ) are entree sized items.
We had Yellowtail from the Crudo or raw small left side and Butternut squash and pork dumpling from the entree side.  The Yellowtail was fab. and as good as any sashimi I have had. There are spices on it so I guess not technically sashimi, but the fish was of that grade.  The dumpling was not what I expected, not crescent shaped pieces of dough with filling. More like a big ""meatball"" with dough around it. Regardless, it was delicious ! We were practically fighting over the last bits.  Def a must return and eat more of the menu place.  Would love to bring more friends here so we could try more items !"
-Ma5JqzuI_3xIAtpNJfQ2g,PbagBMSY1M5D5EF4SsSYJA,3,"It was my first time here, I had 2 diners with me for lunch so our time was short.  The place is clean and the waitress was friendly and helpful.
I was starving so chicken satay was first up, the pieces were big but could have been more tender. They tasted great though and the traditional cucumber and peanut sauces were also excellent.  I had chicken yellow curry off the lunch menu.  The curry was served in a side bowl but was rich so more was not needed.  For $6.95 your lunch has soup, egg roll and wonton chips plus a big ball of rice and the side bowl of curry full to the brim.
Chicken red curry was also ordered same specials same great quality.  The veggies in the red were crisp and delightful.
As far as heat level goes , medium had some zing and hot made me sweat a little.  In other words exactly as it should be.  I will be going back for dinner some time so I can try some of the other curries of course !!"

I have been eating here since High School !!! Great local owners and they now have a 2nd Scottsdale location. YAY.
They have a tasting station at the front, so first timers can figure out what they like before committing to something.  Face it there is nothing like it anyplace. Chinese food fused with Mexican food, has proved to be a match in business and in love.
The Phoenix location has had pics of ""chino Kids"" for as long as I can remember and  the pics go back a long way so its a neat retrospective. Love it when somebody in their 20's+ says ""hey that's me "" and points at some kid on the wall.
Go for the Jade red chicken , you can have it breaded or not. I have mine on salad in place of rice.  The jerk chicken and rice is another don't miss item. You can have anything put on a quesadilla if you would rather have portable food , just ASK !
An Awesome Phoenix and now Scottsdale institution"

If your into french fries don't miss them here !!! The mac and cheese of the day never disappointments and try the bacon wrapped scallops.
My hubby is a big fan of the pork.  I hit this place on a regular basis after dinner downtown so most often for dessert.  The cheesecakes are great. The lemon creme brulee makes me drool and if it's summer time go for the turtle sundae.  They have a small patio outside that faces central so you can watch the traffic go by if your so inclined."

The other locations are set up for you to wait and drink and maybe even have an app to pass the time.  NOT this one.  There is no outside service of any kind, no water, wine, apps, or hostess looking for you if your not in their eye line.  So if you waited an hour and some of your party is over at home depot or something  passing the time they will not seat you. AND if you are not on the very small patio or 4 seat bar they will not look for you.  No restaurant pager or anything.  Pretty weird for a place that has a regular hour or two wait.

I will drive to another location in the future, this one is just not set up correctly for the amount of people in the arrowhead area that go out to eat. Good thing I'm committed to my beloved 1554 beer !!!"

Get on the email list ASAP , as you get access to the special events this place is known for.  I have been here about a dozen times.  Special event , walk in , lunch, dinner you name it. There has never been any incident there of any kind.  Excellent food and service.  It IS a small place so you should call ahead and get a table no matter what time of day it is.  I couldn't even start to describe the food just see my pics"
t24NEAmx2PBVvC84lQmXwA,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,2,"this bar & restaurant can be good or bad depending what you're looking for. FIRST, i hate a bar that charges me a premium price for michelob ultra. HELLO, ultra is made by budweiser so stop ripping off all the ultra drinkers. this place is known for it's off track betting. they get alot of horse racers in there. it gets VERY crowded. their happy hour stinks. it's amazing to me that they get as crowded as they do with the higher prices. they have no discounted food on happy hour at all. every bar in this entire area has cheap food or free food for happy hour. their drink specials are limited to certain kinds of beer. i think their food and drinks are overpriced.  they do have alot of larger tvs, HOWEVER,  these tvs are hanging from the ceiling. you are constantly looking up at them, so be prepared to have a stiff, aching neck. there is a large outdoor smokers patio with tvs outside. there is a full menu offering a wide variety of food. it's a fun place, but the tvs hanging up high suck, and it's a turnoff not to have a better happy hour. i can go within 1/2 mile and have a much better happy hour, way cheaper food & drinks, and much better tvs. i heavily suggest rt osullivan at 59ave & bell rd. if you're a gambler, it's a good place to go.  FORGET FOOTBALL OR SUNS. IF YOU WANT TO WATCH SPORTS HERE, GET HERE 2 HOURS EARLY. WAY TOO CROWDED."
vNwj8u1KbnKPQFMTd3TDWw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"i like this restaurant for their lunch prices and atmosphere. the restaurant is decorated nicely, but i love the bar area. the bar area is separate and has alot of tables and booths and 2 walls of plasmas. it is not just a bar. it's a great place to sit and watch sports and have drinks and food. the full menu is offered in the bar area. so, if you want a full meal and/or drinks during any kind of sports game, the bar area is the place to sit. they offer an inexpensive lunch menu. i think it's around $6.50 for a large lunch. there's different options. you can also use the buy one get one free coupons that are in the entertainment book for the lunch specials making it really cheap. if you just want drinks, you can still get chips and salsa for free. i think the food is a good quality and is similar to macayos or garcias. good all around place. they are also building a large smokers patio with outdoor dining. it should be close to completion."
tJyXQ8xziSqK7dtB0Md3mw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,3,"good atmosphere whether you like sports or family dining. the bar area is somewhat separated from the restaurant. the pizza is a good flavor with quality sauce and toppings, but the pizza is much smaller then it should be. ordered a large with toppings for $23. this was a smaller medium size at best. very thin crust.  chicken parm.  was very good. appetizers are fine. i compare them to applebees. happy hour is very good with cheap drink prices and reduced price appetizers. good place to catch a game. lots of big tvs."
bVv7r8emubqxWAnAk3abGw,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,3,"This place was rated #4 best barbeque in the entire country on a show called ""the best foods ever"". i've been on a long time quest for great barbeque. i just went here and was over excited to try some barbeque that beat out memphis, nashville, kansas city, and the carolinas. i got a large barbequed beef sandwich. it came with no sides. if you want a side, you have to pay for every side separately which range from 1.99-2.99. my beef sandwhich was piled with meat an some sauce, not alot of sauce. my potato salad was 8oz for 1.99. the portions of the food were large and very filling. as far as quality, should this place be ranked #4 in the entire country, no. the quality of the beef was good and there was alot of it. however, i thought the beef was somewhat tough and needed to be smoked longer. it did not melt in my mouth or fall apart. you had to chew on the meat. i didn't like that fact that it just didn't fall apart. the potato salad was good but i thought it was overwhelming with some kind of mustard flavor. i would much rather have a home made potato salad with more of a mayonaise base rather then it turning out yellow in color. they do offer many souther cooked sides like fried green tomato's, collard greens, grits, yams, just everything. i liked the flavor of the meat and thought the potato salad was just ok. with my large beef sandwich and potato salad, it was $7.25. no drink included. everything is billed separately. so, do i think this should be # 4 in the whole country for best barbeque. no. the meat was too tough. would i go here again, only if i'm in the area of 16st and indian school. maybe i'll just have to try the ribs next time."

_YfwjvhsqDPLow4775ZFEg,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,4,"i thought this was a  cool sports bar. casual, not upscale. it had a big wall of tvs. it reminded me alot of gallaghers (after gallaghers were remodeled.)  there's alot of seating and there's a separte room for off track betting with alot of seating. the food was very good. much better quality then you'd get at alot of sports bars.  the menu is very cheap for the quantity and quality of food you're getting. most menu items were between $6-$8. we ordered a crab cake sandwich which is no longer on the menu, but they'll make it for you anyway. you get two huge, quality crab cakes on buns with a side for $7.00 . i've had 2 tiny crab cakes as appetizers at black angus for 9.99 which didn't compare. these crab cakes were awsome and would cost much more as a lunch anywhere else. also ordered burgers. good flavor, lots of toppings. the service was very prompt.  however, the thing that ruined our otherwise great meal, was the management tried to rip us off on our bill, not our waitress. they charged all of us $1.50 per meal  upcharge for our sides that were suppose to be included  with our meals. the menu clearly states that our sides were included. after i pointed this out, the waitress said ""our menus are old. now your sides are no longer free. and you'll have to pay for them."" this was per the manager instructing her what to say. after telling her we would pay what the menu states and that's it, she took all the extra charges off the bill. i told her if they weren't free anymore, they need to tell the customer while ordering and not to just tack on extra charges hoping the customer wouldn't notice.  so, the atmosphere is fun. food is really good. just watch your bills."

M0yfSpeDaYTPEnLjw_0g_g,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,5,"Incredible. Best cake I've ever eaten. Incredible attention to my unique patterns and design. Extremely moist that you couldn't get enough.  I was married in October 2011. The venue gave me 2 choices of bakeries I could use that are included in the package deal I paid for. One was a fancy schmancy bakery with a french name, many impressive flavors (at least that was on their on-line menu), and just all around looked like a fancy bakery. The other was Baker Wee. First, I don't care for cake. I went to both bakeries and was SO impressed with Baker Wee and very disappointed in the fancy bakery. The fancy bakery lied about all the flavors they carried and REFUSED to let us taste the flavors we were interested in. They brought out the 4 most popular flavors of cake recommended by other people that we had 0 interest in. Really? They would also only do 2 lines of filling in each tier. They also had an upcharge for design, # of guests, and size. They refused to make a small 3rd tier for the top of the cake based on my # of guests and wanted to charge me a fortune for it. This fancy bakery nickeled and dimed us, were late with our appointment, and we couldn't even taste the flavors we wanted. We then went to Baker Wee. Awesome! We made 2 tasting appointments with the owner, Laura. We got to taste all flavors. The cake was very very good. They had numerous fillings to choose from and they also did 3 lines of filling in each tier, not 2 like the other bakery. Laura agreed to make the top 3rd tier for FREE, and even though we were just under the guest count we gave her, she didn't charge me at all for extra cake. We chose an incredible red velvet cake with 3 lines of filling for the two big tiers. 2 lines were raspberry cream mousse and the other line was a white chocolate cream mousse. Outstanding. The smaller top tier was a chocolate cake with fudge filling and 2 lines of white chocolate cream mousse. Great! My design was very unique and difficult. Each tier was different. The overall theme was black, burgundy, and silver. This was not a standard wedding cake by any means.  I had unique, detailed patterns on each tier. She even added extra touches for free like sparkle dust and a fondant ribbon with our initials. When I saw this cake done at my venue, it was amazing. It looked exactly like my picture. It had incredible detail. It was butter cream on the outside, but was so well done, it looked like fondant. When we ate the cake, it was by far the best cake I have ever had. It was super moist and exceeded the taste testing. This cake was so good, you just couldn't stop eating it. Baker Wee exceeded all of our expectations. They didn't charge for the extra tier like all other bakeries would. It was the most moist, delicious cake I've ever had."
k3zrItO4l9hwfLRwHBDc9w,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,5,"i LOVE this place. i've been to numerous bars, grills, and restaurants. there is NOTHING i don't love about this place. first, the food is outstanding, quality, and large portions. happy hour has 1/2 off all drinks and 1/2 off all appetizers. these are not your normal typical bar appetizers and they do not skimp on portions. they have a great large bowl of mac and cheese with bacon as an appetizer and ends up costing $3. they give you a full plate of large wings with numerous choice of flavors. 12 large wings. not 6-8 like alot of poor happy hours give you. they have a large appetizer list with a variety of great and unique choices. they're awesome and super cheap on happy hour and still priced well off of happy hour. all drinks 1/2 off!! all, not selected, not reduced priced by $1.  half off period. can't beat it. they have large 64 ounce pitchers of mojitos, redbull and vodka, beer, and other drinks for $20. seriously, i've been to happy hours where 1 redbull and vodka is $7.50 alone. nevermind 64 ounces. i've had their chicken dinners, pasta dinners, numerous appetizers. all outstanding. the atmosphere has lots of big plasmas to watch any game. their seating is unique. they have large tables with part of the seating like a long comfy couch and the other seating are chairs. very comfortable. it's a cool restaurant and sports bar that you can have great food, super cheap drinks, quality, fun, and it's also good for families. there is an area that sits away from the bar area. i've been there multiple times and it's never busy. it's hidden and you can't see it from a major road. it's arounds indian school & scottsdale rd. Go there. try it. happy hour 4-7. Love everything about this place and only wish i lived closer."
2o8YsY97f73GnZgPtTNAvg,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,5,"LOVE this bar/restaurant. first, it's extrememly cool with an indoor and outdoor venues. they open a large glass wall so you feel like you are part of the outside. the inside is full of beautiful large tvs from every angle for every sports lover. it's done in a tropical them. the outside has a large bar with seating on all four sides of the bar. there's numerous tables outside, private cabanas, misters, dirt all over the floor, and a grill where they cook up chicken and carne asada tacos. it resembles an indoor / outdoor restuarant/bar that you would exprience in the tropics. they have happy hour every single day til 7pm. they have reduced priced appetizers for $5 each including my favorite calamari. if you like your wings hot, and i mean hot, this is the place for you. the wings are much larger then most places. they have a full menu ranging from mexican food, american food, and seafood. their drinks are cheap. bottles on happy hour are $2.00. mixed drinks are also reduced. all of the food i've gotten here is good. the appetizers are awesome and i generally go for the reduced priced appetizers. so, it;s a very cool place. tropically themed. you can sit outside in the misters and feel like you're on a beech. they have different specials every day including $1.50 tacos, $5 angus burgers & fries, and others. Go here for the good cheap food, cheap beers $2.00 and catch a game on one of their many large tvs. this is my favorite spot and i'm never disappointed. you also don't need to reserve a private cabana. there are comfortable couches and chairs in the cabanas with private tvs. the outside is very cool. you really do think you're in the tropics somewhere.

ok, new update as of today, sept 15, still love this bar/restaurant, however, they stopped having their reduced priced appetizers on saturdays and sundays. this is one major reason i love this place since alot of bars/restaurants don't do 1/2 off or reduced appetizers on weekends. they stopped because of football. still have their specials during the week. so, during a sunday game, i'd go to rt osullivans, 35cent wings, cheap drinks, giant tvs, another 5 star place."
DPTmovzocZNwgmOfzJTu_A,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,5,"this place is awesome. went there on valentines night. it's quaint & charming. great service. an extensive greek & italian menu. and no, there was no skimping on portions or flavor just because it's caters to two different types of food. the food is very authentic and very good. i ordered a veal plate with sauteed vegetables. we ordered mussels in garlic/wine sauce and some type of cheese for an appetizer. maybe feta?  the mussels were the best i've ever had and i'm from new england. i've eaten plenty of mussels.  for $10, there must've been atleast 30 mussels on the plate. and this is the appetizer. i';ve ordered mussels at restaurants & sports bars and got about 10  mussels for the same price for about 30 here. and these were by far the best.  the free bread & hummus is excellent. they give you this with every meal. they have italian and greek desserts. the baklava was very good. also had an eclair. this food is not average like olive garden & red lobster. it's well worth going to the arrowhead area. there are also 2 brothers who are new owners. the food is thoughtfully prepared. not rushed and not one duplicate plate after another like other restaurants. the white sauce seafood pizza is outstanding. a good place with good service and good ambiance. the prices are under what they should be. alot of the dinners whether it's chicken, veal, or pasta were all around $11, the most expensive was around $13. and of course, there's cheaper things depending what kind of food you want."
uJe6qjWPRMgR7QIyZ_zTwQ,iK91qvh5nA3SzE4pxZtrRQ,1,"i haven't been here in about 7 years. i was soooo disappointed in all of the food. they used to have the best steaks in town. i went here today specifically for a great steak and 1/2 off appetizers. well, first off, they increased their prices, yet are serving you less food. standard with dinner in the past, you would get the steak, potato, salad, beans, corn. now, you get the steak, salad, and very small serving of beans. i ordered the cowgirl 1 lb t-bone dinner, $21.00 .  the steak tasted like it was fried in a pan. there was zero flavor and it definitely did not come off a grill. i would rate it as below average. the salad was lettuce with ranch thrown on it. the beans were very small & bland, just beans, no flavor at all. my boyfriend ordered the largest steak dinner $35.00 . his steak was the 2 lb porterhouse. his steak had more flavor then mine, but it was fairly tough and also lacked that grilled yummy flavor. nothing special and definitely not worth $35. so far, these lousy steak dinners cost us $56.00 .  we wanted to order appetizers which were 1/2 off which they promote on signs & on-line. they had 3 appetizers to choose from, that's it, poppers-onion rings-and something stupid that i can't remember. they had no wings, chicken strips, mozzerella sticks, calamari.....  we ordered onion rings. ok onion rings. our bill was $65, soooo not worth it and not worth the drive.   not only does the food cost alot of money, you get less of it, and the steaks have really gone downhill.  there's other stuff on the menu like barbequed chicken $17, ribs $18, and salmon.  it's definitely expensive to take a large group or family. if you want the baked potato or corn that used to come with the meal, you have to order it separately adding onto your bill. accept for the western theme and theme with the cutoff ties and business cards, this place was way overpriced and the steaks suck.  they have plenty of room for very large groups but expect a very expensive bill with little food to show for it."
qpcZSHPLb8gTCI2T0XSYsA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"So every time I'm craving some pho I always come back here. 90% of the time I go by myself. It's easier than trying to convince someone else to go with me.

The pho is always delicious and the service is always quick! I sometimes wonder if the servers understand what I'm saying, but I'm glad the numbering system is implemented here, ""#10 Please. Thank you."" I should try to learn some Vietnamese basics since that's my number one place to go."
BzZNKx6Des02RuAtT-uOPw,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,2,"this place isn't all that it's hyped up to be. lots of people say ""this is the best place for chinese"" it really isn't people. i've had better from, i'm embarrassed to admit - pei wei. i had the beef pad thai which was watery and bland. it seemed like they just added a load of hot-spices to cover up the watery substance. it was just awful! the server took a long time to refill my water while my mouth was on fire,  i'm never going back to this place again.



this place is too small to bring in a 10 person group, so don't.

sorry Fate i know you mean well to the asian cuisine community, but you're not worth my presence."

I wish they had more selection on their menu, but all in all, it was a good experience.

Wouldn't mind coming here again and just relax with a cup of java.

They have free Wifi for those people who can't part with their laptops. Lots and lots of comfy chair to lounge around which is absent in most of the independent coffee shops, YAY for that!"
0pazeZax1Nt9cn0U_8aSUQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"I've tried lots of Thai restaurants in the East Valley and a couple in Phoenix. I have to say that Mint Thai is the best!! Like someone said earlier, it is in a location that isn't admirable but when you walk inside it's very welcoming.

I took my friend here and he has never had Thai before and after that he said he was a fan. The service is always good. We didn't wait very long till we received our orders.  I'm very lucky for this place to be located in the East Valley.

I ordered the Rama Beef which I always get every time I come here. It has a peanut buttery flavor which engulfed my pallet, I smooth and the seasonings are just perfect. My friend had the Sizzling Beef, I've never had it before but it was really good. They bring out a HOT skillet and place the vegetable and beef on it and watch it sizzles!! It was way cool! Be careful though it's still hot, wait a few minutes.

The music they play is Thai which gives it that ambiance of Asia... I guess. I do want their CDs though even though I don't know what their saying!!

ALSO most Thai restaurants close between 2-4pm this little one is open from 11AM-9PM no breaks in between. I've had this problem before where I'm craving Thai between 2-4pm and no one seems to be open, it's a pain!!"
h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"I've never had Indian cuisine before and a friend of mine has been craving it since he left the UK. So, we opted for Royal Taj. Since I am an Indian cuisine virgin, it wasn't a bad place to eat.

My friend and I had the Tandoori Chicken dish. I thought it was really good!! I ordered the ""half"" serving and it was quite filling. I even had to get a to-go box. The Naan bread was really good!

My friend told me something was missing with the dish. He said ""the Tandoori Chicken dish usually comes with curry sauce..."" (from his past experience). For him it wasn't that good compared to the Indian cuisine is Britain.

But for a ""virgin"" like me it was GREAT!!"
PJgNZN4UYLxP47cy_1c-DQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"If you're ever in the West Valley, say Goodyear area, I would truly recommend Brother's Pizza Express. It's a great mom and pop place you can't really get in Phoenix. The owners came from NYC - those New Yorkers just know how to make great pizza! :)

I think I'm going to make it a tradition to stop by this place on my way to or from California since I'm hardly ever on the West Valley.

Their prices are cheap and you get your money's worth when you go. The people are very friendly and are very personable with their customers. I think if you live in the area and go their a lot it wouldn't be a bad idea to make this place your regular place for pizza.

Great pizza and customer service! Hope to stop by soon!"
t2QVTKD4PSS3vQxM3UP8Qw,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"i've been here on several occasions. friendly staff and fresh bagels. i went used the drive through yesterday morning and they gave me my bagel in a jiffy. fast service!!

the only thing about bagel joints is that they practically slather a pound of cream cheese on your bagel no matter if you go here or Einstein's... one bad this about this place is that every time i get a half dozen bagels i get charge a totally different prices (on 3 occasions) what's up with that? at least keep a consistent price on your bagels. ugh!!

i still love this place though... i especially love cinnamon-sugar bagel, it's got that caramelize sugar on there and when you take a bite it'll crackle. it's pure goodness."

I miss my Chodang dearly. It's been approximately 4 months since my last chow-down. Now I can come back every other week and enjoy some great Korean food once again. I really should try everything on the menu. Today's order was #8 the one before that was #21. I did enjoy the octopus dish... I'm salivating thinking about it."
QS3QxI7u5PRdtbGgI0-UsA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"So my friends took me here as a ""farewell"" dinner get-together. I didn't know what to expect. My friends go there on  a weekly basis, they're practically regulars... NO KIDDING!!

From what they were telling me, if you become a regular there they can practically make anything that's NOT in the menu for you.

Our server Allissa was SOOOO AWESOME!!! I've never been to a restaurant in AZ where the server interacts with their customers on a personal level. It made the place more appealing so in the future, I can take my friends there for sushi.

Thank you guys for the welcoming atmosphere."
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"this place is HOT in all aspects. their chicken is damn good and the atmosphere in the place does get a little too hot at times. it's awesome though! i like the friendly service they provide.

the food is very RICH especially their iced tea, it's like drinking pure sugar, soooo good... sometimes - like once a year. but other than that the food is great!! i suggest trying it out and see for yourself. i love fried chicken and waffle so i can't really complain. their corn bread is good too! it makes me salivate just thinking about the greasiness. YUMMM!!!"
Noi53T0PWNEN9mQRS3-Ncg,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"WOW!! This place is awesome. I love local coffee establishments. The place had a really homey feel to it. The art design on the wall gave the place a unique feel. They're hand drawn and painted, which separates itself from the Starbucks mass-produced art work.

I loved the fact they used Pandora as their music source. Lots of great collection from indie musicians.

I ordered the 12oz Mocha which was very delightful to the palette. It was smooth and refreshing, it didn't have that burn taste. It was just great! Their menu is VERY healthy.

The owners are very welcoming and great to talk to. I like how they interact with the customers which give it that personal connection. I'm definitely going back to this place it's just a GREAT place to hang!!

This place has potential. They are expanding their menu so watch for goodies within the next couple of months. They buy a lot of their produce from local farms which help sustain the community - I'm a big fan of that!!"
LpK_4zdK3kxtpAiLcwEohg,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,3,"I gave this a 3 star because I've had better Thai in the East Valley.


Just got back from Latitude 8 with a friend for lunch. The place is a little difficult to find. Direction: Take a right after the Boston St to the parking lot. It's a little hard to see but it's the first entry after Boston St.

The place is a modern, contemporary restaurant which was a little unusual especially for a Thai restaurant. I ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry which was really tasty!! The presentation of the dish was very neat and appealing. The only thing that bothered me about it was, they served the dish on a HUGE plate which gave an out-of-proportion feel when consuming my meal and they gave you a small dish for your rice. I think it was weird in a sense that when eating my meal I was eating from two different plates. I think I'm just being weird. HA!

Also, bring a sweater. This place gets cold!! Either that or I'm just a wimp.

I was satisfied with the service. The guy who took our order was friendly and was always filling my water THANKS!"
Lz6QUlFkVKtnzSISk0WUPw,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"If you don't mind getting down and dirty with your claws, this place is heaven on earth (I seem to be having this trend of ""heaven"" for some reason). The couple of times I've gone in, I ordered the 1-lb shrimp with trifecta, medium, with white rice and garlic vinegar on the side. I was in a trance until I came up for air. GOD it was so good! They give you a plastic bib so you can eat like a child and splash your family with the juices from shrimp - I'm salivating as I write this - you can even write on the walls if your artistic personality dares to compete with all others who have attempted to be the next Van Gogh.

**NOTE: I have a high toleration when it comes to spicy foods and I ordered MEDIUM, the constant delicious burn is refreshing. But for some, a ZERO or no spice should be something you could order and maybe ask for the spicy sauce on the side.

For those you are not keen on chomping with their hands, for example, my mother who had a manicure that etched GREEN BAY PACKERS prior to coming here, you can ask for GLOVES to cover your delicate spirit fingers.

They compost the scraps! I love that!

I WISH WE HAD ONE OF THESE IN DETROIT AREA! This will definitely be my first stop when I land at PHX!"
sJNcipFYElitBrtiJx0ezQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"Great place! I love how local-oriented they are with their burgers. It's nice seeing businesses moving towards sustainable supplies. The beer is quite lovely. There's so many choices on the menu and to make things lively, they have performers on some evenings.

When I came here the second time, I had a server who was lacking on service. I had to order beer a few times in order for her to deliver; that also happened with our food. Asking for our order a few times is excessive. But we gave her her 20% tip along with a nice note stating she should be more attentive with her table. It's not that big of a deal, but this was also a lesson on her part just in case she gets a really nasty customer in the future.

Anyway, back to the beer! I loved the Table Tap Saison and Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse! Full of body and flavor! Coming back for more soon... as soon as I can leave this tundra of a state (Michigan) :)"
Fv3HvJPQYqfmniTgtIQJzA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"this place is awesome! i had a hard time finding this place due to the trees covering its entrance, but it was worth it!

the service was friendly.

they had free wifi, but they have very limited outlets for laptop chargers. you can also sit outside and enjoy the quiet evening or inside where comfy chairs are provided for your pleasure. it's great for meeting with friends or a study session with your group.

it got kinda hot in there which was the downside to my visit, but other than that it was a memorable experience."
ipFobdM6X_4SNMA9ZBfdAQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"I love this restaurant!

I've to the Tempe, Chandler, Scottsdale, and Phoenix ones. This location is pretty unknown. The food is still GREAT. The ambiance was a little unwelcoming. The bathroom is super cold, like they want you to go in-and-out  ASAP. The people that work there seem like it's their first job at a restaurant . The employees are friendly but not as outgoing as the other locations.

The food was great and the service wasn't bad either. Very quick and knowledgeable.

I'd go to this one again since it's the only one located in the EAST valley."
QsMR_Fp9YRtDegThsOgFLA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,3,"This place is a pretty good pan-asian restaurant. I was impressed with the selection of asian cuisine but the prices were a bit steep for a group of 2. If I came here with more ppl and the bill was more pleasing to the eye, I would definitely give it 4 stars."
XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"Initially I came here expecting a lot of healthy organic relatively tasteless and expensive food, but I was very surprised and boy was I wrong. The drinks/elixirs may sound like medicine but they were very tasty, especially the ginger one (and I LOVE ginger!). We had the onion tart for the appetizer and it was a wonderful taste explosion in my mouth. For dinner we ordered the squash casserole and the bison burger. With the 2 drinks, we got out of there for about $60 which is a bit pricey but so worth it considering the taste, quality and service."
UBQRhqRMW4Sk7kSZvZ1iAQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"Note: this review is only for the macaroons

So I love macaroons and when I heard that this place had a great selection, I had to go. The main problem is the hours of operation which are very limited in my opinion. And as for the dessert of concern, I tried the mini versions and they were very creamy and delicious without being too sweet. I suggest trying a variety of the minis before purchasing the larger ones. There were many that I choose that were a wonderful surprise compared to the others. Like the strawberry cream one, which I am not a big fan of fruit flavored desserts, but this was surprisingly good."
Jj8ubiwwuCR-rrhrrjcryw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"Come here if you really want to experience a truely authentic pho restaurant. Nothing fancy: Dirty vinyl tables, padded and metal framed chairs from the 80s, and the dingy smell...perfect! Once I walked in, I knew I would be leaving happy.

I love Pho Ga, but every other pho place around hear is to lazy to make the chicken broth, its always with beef broth and it just never tastes right. This place on the other hand had the best Pho Ga I've have ever since moving here. The seasoning was perfect and the chicken was cooked well. We came right after lunch hour, so the service was a few minutes slower than expected. Also, they probably went through then etire pot of regular pho broth, so my fiances pho was not as good (it had a lil oil at the top).

I was very impressed with the portion size and price. Its a few dollars cheaper than any other pho place around hear and they offer the XL bowl for $1.50 extra, a great value."
kO1-ZswCgQak2beKUMaYRw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,2,I went back 2 months ago and was not happy. The ramen was so bland and the cost did not help me keep the food down :(
3vta1BSPwdSulcCFMpBjDw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"Ok the first time I came here, I was very disappointed in the selection of items, especially after reading previous review. BUT, then I realized that I went at a bad time, it was the end of the day and they sold out of everything! I recently went back at the store opening time and a lot happier with the market. They sell freshly made bentos, made in house, and they are perfect for microwaving at home or in the market for a cheap and satisfying meal. The key is to get there early, bc they are limited and run out quick, but they have a good variety of bentos.

One draw back is that it is smaller than expected, so if you come from a place like SoCal, where Japanese markets were like large grocery stores with mini stores and restaurants located inside, you might not be too happy."
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,1,"So I've heard everyone rave about this place but every time we've come here, there is always at least an hour wait. So we decided to come early today to avoid a wait...only to be told that they do not do outdoor seating or takeout on the weekends (our dog was with us and we were not going to leave him in the car). We tried to be flexible but it was like they didn't care for our business...looks like it was never meant to be. They didn't even try to offer an explanation for their policy. Don't think I'll try to eat here again...not worth paying $16 for a pizza when the service is not worth it!"
zOL260xaXDYZZPBItzALxQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"NOTE: Only reviewed the soda fountain, not the food (but I wouldn't come here for the food anyways!)

I'm sad to say I found this place too late during my time in AZ. I LOVE this place! The soda combinations are amazing. I've tried the phosphates, egg-creams, malts, etc. My favorite soda/ice cream combos were the casablanca and the scarlett o'hara, but its mostly because they reminded me of sherbet ... yum :)

I've heard the food is horrible so I wouldn't touch it considering the many other great eateries in the area. The only flaw I have found with this place is the hours of operation...they close really early which is horrible when the late night sweet tooth hit.  Great place to go on a hot day or on the weekends...especially if you like soda."
FiEcKfGo-rbYyhoKHw_0MA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"Like many others have said, this is pretty much the only hot pot restaurant I have found and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Like many ShabuShabu restaurants (btw, this is not really shabu shabu...i think its Chinese hot pot, but i'm not sure?) this place can get expensive depending on how many  meats and vegetable options are ordered, but it is good to keep in mind that the quality of the meats, tofu and veggies is very good. The freshness and variety of veggies is what sold me. Also, the place offers a great variety in soup broth selections.

So far, the only one I have tried and really enjoyed is the YinYang broth. This broth is actually a combination of two with a divider separating them so its almost like a two-for-one special. One broth is spicy and flavorful while the other is a bit more settle, allowing your taste buds to enjoy of flavor roller coaster. Another great thing about this place is that they keep adding liquid to the broth so you never run low on it.

Side note for the minus 1 star: avoid the juices and a lot of other drinks, they are too sweet or come straight out of a bottle. Stick to water and they serve you tea at the end."
l8ewXyH88N5Y_BOPXKAQZw,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"Recently tried this place out; however, I'm 50/50 on this place.

First, this review is specific to take-out so I can't speak to the dining-in experience, which a lot of people seem to have enjoyed (see other reviews).

Second, the food tasted great. I have absolutely no complaints about taste. I ordered a variety of stuff and it all tasted great.

Third, the issue came with price and portions. The food was extremely pricey given the portions I received. This was to the extent that I thought I didn't receive all of my food. Additionally, the portions of the proteins (e.g., chicken) for my meals were extremely small. For example, the chicken fried rice was almost entirely just rice. I enjoyed the scavenger hunt for the missing chicken, but I ultimately felt like I overpaid for what I got.

Overall, this place makes some great tasting food. However, from my experience, it's pricey for what I received. I may re-try this place in the future, but my experience left me wanting to look elsewhere the next time I want some good Asian cuisine. If your are going to give this place a try, I may recommend dining in. The reviews for dining in seem to be excellent and that may be what I do in the future."
01xXe2m_z048W5gcBFpoJA,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,2,"Came here for a quick bite. Staff was friendly and I ordered a burger with two patties and a drink. I ended up waiting nearly a half hour to get my food. I understand freshness, but it looked as though they were cooking one order at a time. Five Guys is great, but this location could step it up."
IyVdd_IqwUtzQDTxw2W9qw,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"Came here with the family to see what this place was about. (as well as once more afterwards).  Our visit here was ""different"" given the loudness of the place, as well as the decor. For a ""cowboy"" or ""country"" themed restaurant, I was hard pressed to find a decent steak or stiff drink here. The wait staff is more concerned about their own time than yours. Our waitress kept going over to the mechanical bull (yes, this place actually has one) to talk with another waiter who was operating it. Had she actually paid attention to our table, she would've noticed the half empty glasses, as well as the empty plates.

All-in-all: The food was good, but the service was poor. I give it three (3) stars simply because I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. However, places don't seem to realize the importance of good quality service. Waiters would get more tips and people would order more food/drinks. Something for Saddle Ranch to think about."
Mh2syFX0bG-7vylKY9DE4g,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"I came here a while back when I was getting a tattoo done next door. The food was great! I got a buffalo chicken sandwich that was to die for. I would recommend this place for those looking for a quick bite to eat, as well as quality.

The only bad side to this place is the location. 59th Avenue and Olive is not the best of neighborhoods. For the more cautious, I would recommend getting your food from here while the sun is out. After the sun sets, you are bound to find a lot of shady characters walking about and asking for change/cigarettes."
Jy40ercZIQaNcz2qV3qgow,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,3,"A co-worker and I found ourselves in downtown Phoenix trying to catch a view of President Obama leaving the Phoenix Convention Center after his speech to the VFW convention.  After just missing the president leaving, we wandered over to the Arizona Center and settled on Mi Amigo's for lunch.  The service was excellent. Our waitress was Rebeca. The food was so-so. There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, and this one doesn't top the list, but if you are in downtown Phoenix, and confined to that area, it's not bad.  Another Yelper complained about the salsa being weird, but if the standard salsa is not your choice, ask for the smooth hot salsa.  It's excellent!! You have to ask for it."
AfN3Z1U6QPEgAb5F2CQm8w,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"I've lived in Tempe for a long time, and always wanted to try Casey Moore's, but never seemed to get there. Finally a group of friends said they were meeting there, so I figured this was a good time to check it out. Granted, we were there on a weekday, just after 3 P.M., so the place was not packed (a lot of the reviews I read seem to complain about the place being packed). Overall, a great experience. Love the atmosphere, and the food was great, too."
utoTa3Ngv_oSfB5TIMgN_Q,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,2,"Being of Irish decent, and having toured Ireland in the 80's, this doesn't make my list of good Irish pubs. The atmosphere is nice, I'll give them that.  Although they tout that the bar itself was made in Ireland and imported to that location, it looks nothing like the bars I saw in Ireland. Go there for the alcochol is my recommendation.  Guiness is Guiness no matter where you get it.  I thought the food was lousy. I had the Shepherd's Pie, and I sent it back. The pub does occupy a good location on Mill Avenue, so if you don't like it, you don't have to walk far to find someplace else."
3yMmo1sERpks50quoaA8PQ,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"I've been to Uncle Sal's for both lunch and dinner, and have never been disappointed. The food has always been great, as well as the service. The place has been around for a long time, and through several owners, but you have to give the place credit for being owned at one time by the wife of John Gotti. Not many out-of-towners may know that after Gotti testified against the mob, he was placed into the witness protection program and relocated to Tempe.

Uncle Sal's is a little difficult to locate (as are most mob hangouts). It's located in an unassuming strip mall, which doesn't add to the credibility of the restaurant, but Sal's is an exception. I've taken family, friends and friends of friends to Sal's and everyone loved it."
URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"This is a great restaurant if you're a fan of Chinese food.  I seem to gravitate around the spicey dishes, like chicken and beef.  On their menu, the spicey dishes have a little red chili pepper next to the dish.  Their soups are very good, too.  I tend to go there for lunch because I work near the state capitol, so I'm not sure what the menu looks like at dinner time.  The prices are very reasonalbe, but if you do go there for lunch, go early!!  The place really fills up, and there is not much off-street parking.  After noon time, there are always people waiting to be seated.

Years ago, this restaurant was located on Central Avenue in a little, tiny brick building painted bright pink in color.  They lost their lease in that former location, and the building was torn down, so they didn't exist for about a year and a half.  Finally, they reopened at their current location at 3rd Street and Flower.  I'm glad they returned!!"
wOk2b8zUHWylJOd6FtNsRw,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"This is the original La Canasta visited by President Bill Clinton.  The restaurant is quite small and cramped, but the food is excellent.  For a very resonably priced lunch, try the Workman's special (it's on the menu). I always get the red chili Workman's, but it also comes in green chili as well.  The Workman's comes with red chili meat, beans and rice for a mere $6.49.  It cannot be beat. The staff is very nice, which is a plus in these days of restaurant chains. This place is family owned and operated. To avoid the lunch crowds, you may want to leave for lunch a little early.  The restarant is close to downtown Phoenix for those working downtown or near the Capitol. For those going in a group, be aware they won't do separate checks, and they won't split the check out at the counter.  I guess due to thefts, you cannot pay at the table, you have to pay at the counter on the way out."
_c3ixq9jYKxhLUB0czi0ug,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,3,"The Original Hamburger Works is not too far from where I work in downtown Phoenix, so when a group of us head out for lunch, we occasionally end up here. As the name indicates, they specialize in hamburgers, but they also have chicken burgers as well. The food is good and very reasonably priced. The fries are excellent. The soft drinks you vend yourself, so don't pay for a large cup. Get a small or medium size and keep going back for more.  The protocol is to stand in line and place your order at the window. They call your name over a loudspeaker when your order is ready."
0xyqLvtr0Zbr4G-gML-QmQ,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"This was the second time I've been to Fleming's. Both times have been very enjoyable. This time, a friend told me about a bar special called 5 for 6 'til 7. It is five menu items (mixed drinks, wine, appetisers, etc. for $6 until 7 P.M.). You can still order off the menu, but the specials are only available in the bar, and tables are available in the bar area. Everything we ordered was excellent. I had the steak sandwich (another bar special), which was terrific. If you are a wine drinker, don't go to Fleming's if you are thirsty. The amount of wine they serve (a friend ordered a glass of Merlot) for $6 is ridiculous. They bring a huge glass for the wine, and a little carafe of wine, barely enough to wet the inside of the glass. Stick with the mixed drinks or beer. For you beer drinkers, beer is only available in bottles. No beer on tap, which is a shame for a restaurant of this caliber. Hopefully, when the economy improves, Fleming's will continue with some kind of specials, like the 5 for 6 'til 7."
WOz66UuVsfc2K9GxzfDnGg,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,3,"No, not named for this great country of ours, but for America, the owner. Went there based on a recommendation from a friend at work, and he was right...this place was great. Had the carne asada burrito. The meat was perfectly flavored and the burrito was freshly made. It could not have been better. Opted for the pricey Coca Cola from Mexico. Very good, but at $3 a bottle, a little pricey, especially where I tend to drink a lot of soda when I eat lunch. They now have a liquor license, so they offer a variety of Mexican brand beers. Sodas come in bottles and cans, depending on the brand. One nice option I liked was they accept credit cards, which at first isn't obvious. There are no signs that they take credit. The only way I knew was seeing a tiny magnetic strip reader next to the cash register. The restaurant is inside an old, small house, so there isn't a lot of room, and it's tough to find seating if you're more than a party of two. There is off-street parking behind the restaurant, but again, it's the back yard to an old home, so parking can be tight."
1hkksm102yQY1DyfTPSzmA,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"I love Monti's.  I've been dining at Monti's for over 14 years, and the only thing I'm afraid of is that they go out of business.  Within the last 2 years, every time I've been there, the place is dead. DEAD!  I just don't know why. The food is excellent, and the service is great.  Travis at the bar was great to talk to.  He knows the area and knows his job.  The great thing about Monti's, aside from the great food, is that I don't think there is a 90 degree angle anywhere in the building.  Everything is crooked!  I LOVE IT!!  Monti's is a little bit on the pricey side, but well worth it.  PLEASE, PLEASE, Monti's, hang on through these troubled times.  Mill Avenue wouldn't be the same without you."
ydhgMcBh4A_eihzEAg9LLQ,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"After reading some of the other reviews, I have to defend In-N-Out. If you want a good burger and fries, you have arrived at the right place.  Great milkshakes, too.  As a female friend of mine once declared ""good hangover food"". I usually go through the drive-through, but the wait can be quite long.  One good policy change they adopted was to accept credit cards.  About a year ago, they were a cash-only business and I can't tell you how many times I saw people drive up to the payment window (at the drive through) and drive off without their food because they only had a credit card to pay with.  In this day and age, I would think a business would have to accept credit cards just to survive."
hIgGkG1JnHX4xmVuOgegDw,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,5,"If you like steak & cheese subs, Forefather's is the BEST! Owners Tony and Mary care about their customers, and make you feel like you are dining at their house.  There is nothing I like better in the food service industry than a business run by local owners who are on-site and often do the cooking and care about customer service.  Their sub rolls are baked locally and the meat is flown in from Philidelphia.  For those of you non-beef eaters, they serve a chicken filled sub.  Prices range from $6.59 (including tax) for a regular sized sub to $10.89 (including tax) for the large with fries and a large soda.  I'm told a real Philly cheese steak is made with Cheese-Wiz (when I think Cheese Wiz, I think an aersol can, but this Wiz is different).  I prefer provolone cheese versus Cheese Wiz (the Wiz is a little too sweet for me). But, as the company tee shirts proclaim, ""there's nothing like a good wiz""."

The food is great tasting, but it may not prolong your life.  But, hey, none of us can live forever.  Their chicken is the best, cooked golden brown and crispy.

The restaurant is located just south of downtown Phoenix in an old house.  There is not much space inside the house, so if you go there for lunch, leave early.  There are lines out the front door after 12 noon.  If you are in Phoenix, you have to try Lo Lo's.  There is nothing else like it."
PbTh7aX0_yyaXFOXAlhI4A,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,4,"Is it The Turf or the Turf Accountant?  The cover of the menu reads The Turf Accountant, while the receipt reads The Turf.  Either way, I like it.  The restaurant/bar is owned by Andy and Frank, the same owners as Seamus McCaffrey's Irish Pub in downtown Phoenix at the San Carlos Hotel.  The Turf is close to downtown on Central Avenue, just a few blocks north of the central bus station.  The menu is very similar to the menu at Seamus.  I ordered the shepherds pie, which was very good.  I have to say I like the atmosphere and surroundings of the Turf better than Seamus.  I went to the Turf  for lunch to celebrate a friends birthday, and everyone said their meals were good, although Manolo M. dropped gravy on his dress shirt from the bangers and mash.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  The Turf is located right next to the Arizona State University's downtown campus, so it would be interesting to return at night to see what the cowd is like."
89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ,izh3qeYFVaU7cUHjUPThdw,5,"Best Mexican food in Phoenix.  The restaurant is located in a rough area, but it's worth the risk.  I prefer the Oaxaca's special, without the beans.  While there, order some tortilla's (either corn or flower) to take home.  They're fresh baked, still hot when you get them.  This isn't a restaurant to sit around and socialize with friend's. It's located in a cinder block building with bars on the windows. Also, they do not serve alcohol.  Try to get there while the sun is still shining. If working near downtown Phoenix and going to Carolina's for lunch, get there EARLY! The place is packed for lunch."

I've been there at least a dozen times, and honestly, it's just o.k. I've only had the steak and cheese sub, and it's good.  They tend to use too much cheese in the steak and cheese.  The sub rolls are small, but they make up for it with way too many fries.  I've only gone there with co-workers for lunch, and everyone seems to agree it's average food. A previous review mentioned Sticklers restaurant located across the street from Crazy Jim's. I think I'd stick with Sticklers, but co-workers keep dragging me back to Crazy Jim's.  I will say the staff is excellent and very nice."
HJLiVxuvtN0n73BASSZKoQ,69GPwit9GNmMjSqzjm6HQQ,2,"Okay so

Food was 3/5
Its good but not in any definition special, but then again they market it based on their legendary popular name so that gets our hopes up, no?
So, don't be afraid to give it a try. It's quite decent except for the pita/flat bread thingy smells like plastic and a tad too soggy, but that's minor considering this is a fast food place.

Food portion 3/5
They need to balance out the amount of lettuce n rice, mine didn't come with nearly enough rice.

Service 4/5
Quick n courteous, just need to be a bit more clear of the procedure in the sauce section.

Packaging 0/5
My lid was loose ( I told them Togo) so use your best imagination to picture my lunch.

Price: Not cheap, but Arizona experience 25% minimum wage increase in January 2017, not their fault.

So I probably need to comeback in a few months to give them another try once they work on the kinks."

Customer service from my cashier, the old man on the video, Stanley? is one of the worse I had (I use Groupon, and he had a hard time with his Groupon apps). Very long story short, it was straightened up but I am disappointed on how it was handled.

I hope they figure something out to avoid this in the future or just stop Groupon altogether to avoid further issues.

The younger cashier, was very apologetic about it, and did try to made it up with exceptional customer service, thus save them from one star, I hate giving locally own business one star anyway.

All things said n done, I wish them the best, since I like locally owned eatery."

The menu is small but it is a tapas bar so no surprises here. I thought there was a good variety of fusion dishes. Some were definitely better than others. I give the food a 7. It was a little on the pricey side for what you got but then again it is a tapas bar which translates to ""it'll cost you"".

My only beef was the waiter was constantly bothering us. I swear we barely got a chance to look at the menu and there he was. We ordered a few tapas and cocktails and as soon as we finished eating he was back again! I guess that's good service but seriously...some of us like to take our time when we're dining. I give the service a 6 because the waiter was a little overzealous."

Oh right the food - I didn't think it was all that good. I had the Wild Ahi Sliders with wasabi, radishes, cucumber on sesame brioche. While the presentation was breathtaking the flavors were so so. I'm hoping it was just what I ordered but my friends didn't enjoy their lunch much either. We were all in agreement the Green Armie drink was probably one of the best green tea drinks we've had aside from my beloved boba tea.

The service was great and our waitress, cute as a button, was very helpful. I just wish I would have enjoyed the food a little more. I guess I may have to go back and try another dish just to make sure I'm not missing out."

Anyway, I really like this place. It's not fancy by any means but it has great food and is well worth the drive. I can't wait to try the Croque Madame and some of the yummy looking macaroons."

I swear we were like two kids in a candy store upon entering. It smelled amazing and everywhere we turned there was something that took us back to our home reminding us of the special meals our mom and bubba had made.

We decided to have lunch and both ordered a small plate consisting of a few perogi's, a cabbage roll and some rye bread. To our surprise they were both really delicious. My sister had the potato perogi's and I tried the sauerkraut. You'll hardly ever hear me say someone makes a perogi as good as my mom but between you and I...Europa makes a seriously good perogi! The cabbage rolls are a little different than what we grew up with but were still quite tasty and were very satisfying.

Europa also has a deli counter and grocery section which carries a lot of the hard to find items needed to prepare some our favorite holiday foods. You can also purchase frozen perogies, cabbage rolls & blintz or call in a larger order. If sausage is your thing - you MUST come here!! They have an amazing selection of sausage and also carry farmers cheese. Ohhh and don't forget the pickled herring and borscht!

The bakery case is filled with delicious cookies, pastries and rolls. The Napoleon and poppy-seed roll were stalking me and I happily surrendered to them. The staff was also kind enough to give us a little treat - a Pczki! I'll have to save this for later as I'm stuffed.

The staff is very friendly and even helped me estimate how much farmers cheese I would need to make my mom's nalesniki. Thanks ladies don't be surprised if you see me every weekend. ;)"

No, I'm not dreaming...I had dinner at Saigon Pho last night! I love this place. The menu is so elaborate making it difficult to make a decision. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach but who doesn't like leftovers the next day. Okay, so maybe Pho isn't so good the next day.

This restaurant is a must try! I've been coming here for over a year and it's always busy. Service is good and best of all the price is right - CHEAP! Try the Beef Chow Fun, fresh Spring Rolls or the Salt 'n Pepper Squid. Actually, why not try them all. This is a great place to come with a group who is open to trying new delights.

I can't wait to go back. I'm thinking I might have to stop by for some takeout next week!"

I had the two egg & bacon breakfast and was able to substitute the eggs for egg whites. The menu even has potato pancakes so of course I shared one with my friend - so delicious!! Portions are really really large so keep that in mind when ordering. I wonder if anyone is ever able to finish a full portion.

Chompie's is not only a great sit down place for breakfast, lunch or dinner but also has a huge deli where you buy their delicious bagels, baked goods, flavored cream cheeses and best of all the smoked meats!!"

A really fun environment for a night out with friends without the snotty club feel is what you can expect. My friends and I have always had a great time here and it is always packed so they must be doing something right."
ALn_0f-Usn3n0a9WBcjhhg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"My girls and I decided to met her for happy hour on a Friday. It's relatively easy to find but the parking if you're okay with shelling out a few bucks.  There is a lot in the back to park but it requires you have a few dollars on you. Does anyone carry cash anymore? My word of advise DO NOT park at the meters unless you are prepared to run out on the hour. Apparently, the city of Phoenix is trying to make a few extra dollars by extending the meter hours. You have to pay at a meter until 8pm and that goes for Saturdays as well. And let me tell you, that meter maid stocked my car. I swear I went out a few times to throw in a few quarters and I think she was waiting around the corner for the time to expire. YES, I got a ticket!

Okay, enough about the city of Phoenix parking Nazi's. Hanny's is a delightfully stylish restaurant and lounge with great martinis. The drinks were a little expensive but packed a serious punch. There wasn't a huge selection of food on the menu but enough to satisfy most people. We each tried a different pizza. I had a margarita pizza and it delicious. Honestly, it was like three meals for me...very large portions once again.

If parking was a little more manageable, I think we'd go back. Hello Phoenix don't you want people to spend time downtown? If so, stop charging for parking and more will come!"
H3Gastz2T6iiSRGmlbtoXQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Stingray for Happy Hour makes me happy! The lounge was completely full and by the time we left the restaurant was also jammed. Guess Stingray makes everyone happy!

The atmosphere had me feelin' all tingly...nothing better than a beautiful interior designed with attention to detail. Well, the food was pretty yummy too and the happy hour menu was pretty decent. Special prices on cocktails, beer and few rolls. Lets talk about cocktails - the Asian Blond; lychee puree, lychee liqueur and champagne, is a little too tasty and goes down way too easily.

Of course our eyes were much bigger than our stomachs once again. My friends weren't too keen on the crispy spicy tuna roll but that just meant more for me!. It's not like anything you've had at other sushi restaurants in the valley. The rice has been lightly crisped on the outside and the tuna is hot hot hot topped with a jalapeno. Crisped? is that a word?  The presentation and flavor is sure to delight even the pickiest of people. We also tried a new roll - cucumber on the outside with salmon on the inside - very refreshing!

Service was also great. Rachel was our server and even with a full restaurant she gave great service.

This might be a regular happy hour place for me. God I love sushi!"
F2F6rJ_SPo-lUhJ_AmufLA,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"The bread, brownies and hazelnut cake are over the top in my book - well worth the steep prices! The panini's are always good here too and they have offer a lot of other great lunch items. The last time I was in they also had a breakfast sandwich - which sounded very yummy. You can't go wrong with MJ's bread - best in the valley!

The cupcakes on the other hand were dry and somewhat bland. Yes, the icing is good but I like to taste the cake too."
vC23Fq8lMkNiZ4F8yh3ukQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,2,"Uh, not sure I had the best experience. The service was a little slow and then once we got our meals the waitress turned into a stalker. I swear she came to our table every ten minutes. Maybe we were taking our time a little too much for her liking?

The food was just okay. We ordered sashimi - hamachi yellowtail, saba mackarel, maguro tuna. The tuna and yellowtail tasted okay but nothing spectacular. The mackarel was awful! It honestly tasted like I'd cracked open a jar of herring! I'm pretty sure this isn't the flavor it's supposed to have or at least I hope not. I've had mackerel before and it didn't taste anything like what I experienced at Moira. It also seemed as though they were rationing the wasabi portions - we asked for more wasabi twice! We also had the seaweed salad and tuna poke which was pretty good.

I guess I had high hopes for this place and it didn't  exactly deliver. I think I'll stick to Sakana or Hiro."

I'm a firm believer that not everything is as it seems. The exterior of this cafe is rather modest and not for snotty at heart looking for ""the scene"". The only scene you'll find here is aromatic dishes served in a quaint cafe by the friendly owners.

I've been to Thailand a few times now and although the food is not quite as good as my dinner on the beach, with the sun setting over the ocean, in the Phi Phi island's...this is Gilbert! With that said it's very good and lived up to my expectations of what I know Thai food in America to be."

Cyclo has some serious personality. Oh wait that's Justina! :) Cyclo does have a lot of personality to it with it's stylish decor and Justina just adds more to it. I really like the fact she comes and visits all the tables. Heck she's even sat down with us before. Love it when the owner likes to make nice with their patrons.

P.S - don't forget to bring your vino!

Onto the food...it's always fresh and flavorful. I've never had a bad experience here. The Pho is great, lemon grass chicken vermicelli is awesome and the green beans and pancake...Mmmmm!

This is the type of place I like bringing out of town guest to. You always know service is going to be good and there's no gambling with the food. I'm a fan Cyclo!"

2dOS56h2QueEIDAdP9-1TQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,5,"After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon.

We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho.

I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)"
TulmRC5V0--dnXYd_GOSvA,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Golden Gate Chinese is the most authentic Chinese in the valley that I have encountered. However, it's still not as authentic as I'd like it to be. I'm still searching!!

I really enjoyed all the dishes we tried and found all to be quite flavorful. We were a little disappointed in the Szechwan Chicken as it wasn't as spicy as we hoped for. The Crab Angels on the other hand made up for it. These little guys are a flavor explosion! The Mongolian Beef, Chow Mein, and Chop Suey were really good. No leftovers to be had. :)

The atmosphere was pretty much what I had thought it would be -seemed fitting. It didn't bother me that there were no windows. The restaurant was really clean, had spacious tables and excellent service!"

PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"For starters, serving a drink called a ""G Spot"" at 11:30am for $3 automatically gets a restaurant 4 stars in my book. Seriously, okay how can one really be serious after that opener, Fez is great!  Take away the $3 drink specials for breakfast/brunch/lunch it's still a great place.

We were celebrating my new job and move to San Francisco and I can't think of a better place to spend a nice brunch. Fez is charming and hip, has a great wait staff and phenomenal food. Did I mention the $3 drinks;-)?

We all ordered something different, some ordered breakfast and some ordered lunch and none of us left hungry or disappointed. Most of us took home half of our food since the portions were ridiculously large.  We got there at 11:30 and the restaurant was pretty packed; from people in their early twenties to a couple in their sixties.

The location is great, Central & Indian School, and has ample parking.  I'm sure Fez at night is as great as it is on a leisure Sunday morning.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did.  Eat, Drink and be Merry!"

I would have to say the best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow! If you like tart you'll love this.

I thought overall the service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our food

VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Sooooo good!

My friend had heard about Tandoori Times through his Indian work mate. I must say we were pretty excited to try and had rather high expectations.

I was able to make reservations online which was great although we didn't receive a confirmation email so I wasn't sure if our table really did get reserved. I called to confirm yesterday and they received our reservation - all was good.

Tandoori Times in located in a plaza in Scottsdale off Hayden. It's kind of tucked in the back but there is plenty of parking near by. It was really cute - didn't look like your typical Indian restaurant. In fact, it looked more like a little American cafe with very minimal decor. We were seated immediately and noticed they had a belly dancer - always fun to watch! We took note there were a lot of Indian patrons enjoying dinner here (always a good sign).

We shared the Aloo Tikki (Potato patty served with garbanzo beans, onions, mint & tamrind chutney), Garlic & plain Naan bread, Mango Chutney, Chicken Masala (Base of onions, ginger garlic, and vine ripened tomatoes combined with chicken), Lamb Vindaloo (Lamb cubes cooked in a special vindaloo aromatic sauce with potatoes) & Chicken Vindaloo (Chicken cooked in special vindaloo aromatic sauce with potatoes). The food was very good and the Vindaloo had a serious kick to it so if you aren't into spicy curries you may want to have them tone it down. The thing I normally notice with Indian food is it can be on the salty side...not Tandoori Times though. The combination of fresh flavors and spice really was art like. Oh and the Mango Chutney was perfect - my British friends and I thought we had died and went gone to heaven.

The service was really good and our waiter had a great sense of humor. Gotta love service with a side of humor or sarcasm. :) We brought a birthday cake with us and to my surprise the restaurant didn't charge us that  stupid cake cutting fee. I hate it when restaurants charge for that. I can cut my own cake! The belly dancer was really good and as the boys said with a smile ""she's really flexible"". The only negative was the music was really loud and we weren't able to talk with out having to raise our voices.

Give it a go! It's delici."

The restaurant itself is very nice - large clean space - pretty the opposite of what I expect in a Vietnamese restaurant. - guess I'm more of a hole in the wall kinda gal."
fSFzgt_QzJRUN0qNzTAwig,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,5,"After having worked next door to the Roosevelt Tavern for over a year I feel compelled to write something. Affectionately referred to as Rosie's by me and my coworkers - I have spent many of evenings here. We used to joke with Matt that we should have a running tab for the amount of time spent in this fine establishment.

""Rosie's"" is located in an old house and definitely has that warm comfy feel of home. As you walk in, a beautiful fireplace with two arm chairs to the right welcomes you. Tables, chairs and couches are scattered throughout, in the several little rooms, comprising this house with the water closet centrally located. Each room has it's own charm down to the wall paper and moldings. The cozy atmosphere, huge selection of beer and yummy nibblies makes it tough to leave. They also offer a selection of wines to choose from. It doesn't hurt that Matt & Ernie know us all by name either.

I've tried a few items from the menu and highly recommend the chips and dip, pretzel, roast beef sandwich with caramelized onions, and the tomato soup and grill cheese sandwich. Matt makes a mean grill cheese sandwich!! :) The bread is really amazing - slightly chewy and sweet with loads of owey gooey cheese. Oh man, I want me a grill cheese sandwich.

If you haven't been to Matt's other fine establishment - Matt's Big Breakfast I suggest you give it a whirl too. Home cooking at it's best!

I give The Roosevelt Tavern five stars."
Lsy_RA1xk9qHFLzLNWKBww,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"This is an ideal spot for a date - cozy, intimate and food that invigorates the senses! We shared an assortment of appetizers: Baba Ghanoush, humus, falafel, dolmathakia and spanakopita. All the appetizers were really good and I must I say the dolmathakia were the best I've had in the valley. Our main course was the Lentil salad with chicken and tabolui salad - sooo good. I have no idea what spices were in lentils but wow they were really good. There was a hint of cinnamon or maybe it was nutmeg, I'm not sure but whatever it is it definitely works."
3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"I've been to Liberty Market many of times now, it's just down the street from me and thought it was due time I gave my two cents. Joe did an outstanding job on designing this restaurant/coffee house. It's exactly what downtown Gilbert needed! There is even a funky little market at the entrance that sells nostalgic trinkets and local organic produce. It's the perfect place to shop if you are looking for something unusual. Oh and I have to mention I was so excited to see Dare cookies, a product I grew up with in Canada, on his shelves - they make the best Lemon cookies! If you've been to any of Joe's restaurants you're probably familiar with the cafeteria style ordering. I'd prefer sit down service but somehow this concept works well in all his establishments.

All most all of Liberty Markets ingredients are locally grown and produced. The food is pretty decent, I have tried a few of the pizza's in the past and thought they were pretty tasty. I did however think the Salami pizza was a little too salty...I know I know it's Salami. My friends tried the 1/2 lb burger and raved about it for days. Personally, I would say the breakfast here rocks in comparison to lunch and dinner. So many unique choices on the menu, fresh pastries baked daily, and a variety of specialty coffees. What more could you want!

This is a great place to sip on a latte and shoot the breeze with friends. Liberty Market is one of those places where you can go and feel at home. Joe, the owner, can be seen walking around talking with all the patrons...he never seems to forget a name or face. Check it out for yourself."
gQnCTgwNFHfB40c8NoGAlw,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"I really like Sweet Tomatoes but today my sister and I stopped in for lunch. I don't know if they recently raised their prices but $12.00 seems a little excessive for lunch. Honestly, isn't  that what dinner used to cost here? Okay enough about the price.

The salad toppings were all delicious and after having a little soup we were all pumped to have the cranberry / apply crisp! Mmmm  We scoured the dessert bar only to find jello, pudding, cottage cheese and a broken ice cream machine. You know when you've built up the moment in your head of delicious crisp apples with tart cranberries covered in a warm oatmeal crisp and then suddenly the vision is blurry? My heart literally sank! No one ever wants to settle but today I settled...I settled for the chocolate pudding. :("
8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Dining at Coup Des Tartes last night was treat for all my senses. It's a cute art nouveau style home made into a restaurant and they have a separate room that can accommodate up to 40 people for a private party. The presentation of the food would make all the Iron Chef's proud and flavor beyond belief!!

We started with the Brie Brulee which was so delicious. The combination of the creamy flavor from the cheese with the caramelized apples was sinfully good. We both could have eaten the entire order but new we needed to save room for the entrees. The entrees we decided upon, and it was a tough decision,  were Duck in a Rhubarb glaze and the Filet Migon in horseradish creme fraiche. Both dishes were prepared perfectly medium rare as we ordered. We were both stuffed at this point but after watching the tables around us receiving their dessert course we just had to take a peak. All of the items sounded great but we opted for the lemon goat cheese cheesecake with a hazelnut crust. This dessert was so delicious - the lemon was sweet and the goat cheese gave it just the right hint of sharpness. I would have never thought these ingredients could taste so good together.

Not only were we thoroughly impressed with the cuisine, the service was great. They were very attentive but not to the point of bothering us. The only thing missing was a great bottle of wine in which we didn't bring...our bad."

Rosie's definitely has the feel of an authentic Irish Pub down to the wait staff with their lovely Irish accents. The beers were nice a cold and well you can't be in an Irish pub and not try the Fish and Chips! Honestly, the best Fish and Chips I've had anywhere in the valley. It's not pieces of fish like everywhere else it's a full fillet and cooked to perfection.

My only complaint would be the service. Our waiter couldn't remember our drink or food order and seemed to be confused most of the time. I guess that's why I'm not a waitress either!

All in all a great place to hang out with your friends or enjoy an afternoon brew."

The sushi is pretty good, very fresh, and I've tried a few of the Korean dishes which were also pretty good.

I really like the atmosphere, very cute and reminded of some of the little cafes in Sapporo I used to visit. The menu is very diverse and prices are reasonable for the quantity - more than enough food!"

Chodang is not a fancy place but what it lacks in decor it makes up for in flavor. We had the spicy tofu & seafood soup with a fresh egg added. The soup was piping hot and really packed a punch. I'm not a huge lover of tofu but the combination of flavors in this soup made the tofu come alive. We also shared the Korean BBQ (chicken). I was a little disappointed we couldn't cook at the table but it didn't look like the restaurant was set up for it. The chicken itself was really moist and tender.

One thing to note is portions are very generous so unless you're really hungry - share!

I haven't been to many Korean restaurants here in the valley but I will definitely make another trip to Chodang!"

Pfi812k1E6TMnC1NRzH3Pg,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"What an absolutely incredible experience! Orange Sky is located on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Resort. A private elevator whisks you upstairs, whereupon you are greeted by smiles and hellos by *every single person* with whom you come into contact. The staff is one of the friendliest and professional we've ever encountered. Great job, guys!! This is so important and so overlooked by other places!

So glad we made reservations on a Saturday night. We made our decision to go there in the afternoon so when we went to make the reservation, only 5:45pm or 9pm were available. Sunset was at 7:41 that night, so we went with the 5:45pm reservation. We wound up arriving late--a little after 6pm--but we were seated immediately.

It turned out that many other tables were available at that time, so if you go early without a reservation you'll probably get seated.

It didn't matter that we were early for the sunset, though. 6pm turned out to be the perfect time to enjoy the changing colors of the sky. And *that* is why I'm glad we made a reservation...because by being forced to go at 5:45 (in our ignorance we would have made a later reservation) we were able to fully enjoy the sky. The sun actually dropped completely at 7:41, leaving us with only light left until well after 8pm--no colors, so keep that in mind when calculating this! (Also, remember sunset changes during the year, depending on the season). We went one of the longest days of the year.

The space itself is unique. A modern main lounge area up front--with curved, modular seating and window views all around --further expands into another area where a piano sits. This area has additional seating and a dance floor.  You'll find the restaurant itself at the end of the long corridor. This hallway is flanked on one side by private tables with westward views, and on the other by two private party rooms and their state of the art kitchen.

Entering the main dining room for the first time is a treat for those who are already jaded by most high end restaurants. The room is vast, but warm and inviting, with a fireplace centered on the back wall. The 270' view is amazing. You can even dine or take drinks outside on the lavishly furnished patio. If you're lucky you'll see a glimpse of wild stallions running through the reservation  toward the east side. You can dress up here and ENJOY it. It is worth the effort.

The food here is stellar. We both had the Chilean sea bass, and shared sides of corn with chard, and green chile mashed potatoes. The bass was cooked sparingly and to absolute perfection, which delighted our server when we told him. (He said that many people expect it to be cooked more--which ruins the delicate texture). It was seared and caramelized on the outside and *barely* raw in the center--just a wisp. Perfect.

The sides were huge. Each side feeds two people, possibly three. We shared a full bottle of sauvignon blanc, drank tap and sparkling water, and finished with French press coffee. Our anniversary was earlier in the week, and the waiter brought us a gratis chocolate mousse desert with a ""Happy Anniversary"" message to share.

The bill came with two caramel/chocolate candies that seemed homemade. It was phenomenal caramel! Our entire bill was $130. We expected to pay more. We cannot recommend this restaurant enough! The value is there. The food, most importantly, is fantastic. And really...isn't that what dining is all about if you are going to go out with people you love to share it?

GREAT PLACE!!"
hb96ToDVKWQkAj5h-UB5Ow,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,3,"Just okay.

The pho broth is good, but not spectacular. Meat in pho very skimpy. Not much flavor to overall dish.

Shaken beef somewhat tough. Flavors just not...there.

Macaroon ice cream sandwich looks pretty. The ice cream is good and plentiful, but the macaroons taste like they are mass produced, came out of a box, or just plain old. Once you've have a perfect macaroon, you won't be able to enjoy these here. I did not enjoy mine. Macaroons should blow your mind. These don't.

Spring rolls fresh and expertly rolled. Accompanying sauce lacks...you guessed it..flavor. Nice addition of crushed peanuts and chili sauce is available, buf it had a thin consistency.

The portion sizes are decent. Overall, though, it seems as if Pho 602 is sacrificing effort and ingredients for profit, which is a shame because any time you have a nice, big, clean space in a good location it has the potential to be something great...and this just isn't great.

I'm picky about my Vina-food. There are better places to have it than here."

Wow, I 'm a bitch. I just realized that I gave Lin's Grand Buffet four stars.

Over the years we have become rather stringent in our reviews. There is no sense in being conciliatory when there are so many other restaurants to patronize. Our dollars go only so far. So if you are a reader who will eat just about anything you may like this place a lot. It starts out very promising. It is neat and clean inside and quite romantic, and the people are friendly. Great date night for intimacy --just not for foodies. If you have a trained palate you will get more out of this review. If you like anything, then you will probably not get much out of this review. We love all food--even truck food. We don't discriminate, but we give fair reviews and credit only where credit is due.

Started with the breadbasket. There were 2 of us, so only 2 rolls brought. They were small and stale. We also had the pepperdews stuffed with goat cheese (six per order at $6 a plate), and the bruschetta (we chose an order with half tomatoes and half crab meat. There were two of each.)

The goat cheese appetizer was cold- not at room temperature- therefore the sweetness of the pepperdews was a bit cloying, but redeemed with the pepper flavored olive oil. A dollar a bite! Kinda leaves a bad taste.

In our opinion the pepperdews should have been packed in extra virgin olive oil and stored at room temperature--and the cheese filling taken out of the fridge an hour before opening the restaurant. The entire appetizer should be room temperature--if they had been we could have eaten another plate of them. The idea of them is appetizing, but the presentation abysmal. Side note: The bit of green  on top was wilted to the point of browning and would make Chef Ramsey cry. Flair is not as important in our book. But, just saying...

The bruschetta, for the money, was a huge disappointment. While there was a sufficient amount of crab on each slice of toast, the bread was not fresh, it was not piping hot, and the crab was absolutely frigid. Crab should have been warmed up first, then served over PIPING HOT, TOASTY bread--which it was not. The crab was (obviously fake) another kind of flaky white fish. Barely passable. The garlic was abundant and good. The tomatoes were sweet cherry tomatoes. We would take imported canned San Marzanos al fiorno over fresh cherry tomatoes any day of the week. Just a disappointment.

My Sicilian husband pronounced the bruschetta as an  Italian would (broo-SKETT-ah). The waitress passive-agressively shamed him, by repeating it twice as most Americans say it (broo-SHETTA), which only showed her ignorance. Otherwise, she was extremely friendly and talkative and the service was consistently good throughout our meal. I am being very fair here. She was truly nice, but she was sort of clueless.

Our California Chardonnay was $29 for the bottle and our server described it as oak barrel aged. It had zero oak--so we think our server possibly made a bit of a mix up there. Anyway, it was just ""okay"". I expect a lot more for the money, but even then, we still consider $29 for a bottle a low price/every day price and yet it should have been better, but then wine is totally subjective in our humble opinion.

We ordered a margharita pizza because we didn't think they could possibly disappoint us with something as beautiful and simple as tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. Oh boy-- it was PRACTICALLY INEDIBLE!

The crust was decent, even a bit blackened on the bottom like we like it. And that's where that ends. The cheese was a fancy shred blend--like something you'd buy at the grocery store. HORRIBLE. Where were our fresh dollops of beautiful mozzarella? The basil was fresh and friseed, They put cherry tomatoes on this pizza! Not good Amano! Not good! The tomatoes were too small...too sweet. Just...wrong. This is not the pizza of our homeland. Barely palatable. The reason for one star.

In our ongoing effort to find something noteworthy we did something that is law in our book--if the menu offers creme brulee we order it, even if we are not hungry. Creme brulee is a godsend. Unfortunately, the creme brulee here is ""meh"". If you've had truly great creme brulee nothing else will compare. The best we ever had was at Cafe Cherie in Montreal. It was in a low, wide dish with a thick, rich custard and thick, hard sugar top. Amano serves a small light creme brulee with a sugar top as light as an angel's wing. If that's your thing you'll love it. The vanilla bean had a good flavor. It just fell short in our book, and again--it was frigid, like almost everything else we ate there. Amano--you must take things out of the fridge! You'd solve most of your problems if you did. We did not order the olives for fear they would be pulled from a fridge."

We are very particular in our restaurant reviews, because we will spend $150-200 for a dinner for two and we expect a lot in return. This place does not disappoint.
Started with cocktails as we waited for our table. We made a reservation, which is recommended if you want a table outside. I had a sazerac, husband had grey goose and tonic. Both made nice and strong.  Priced accordingly. I hadn't had sazerac since probably 1985 at a jazz bar in Dallas. Back then it was served in a sazerac glass straight up. Here at the House it was on the rocks. Supposedly made with absinthe, but it must have been the legal kind here sold stateside. Good drink. Strong and like a Manhattan, but better. Interesting.

Started dinner with the cheese platter. They were out of the truffle cheese, but we went with four others. It was served with dried cranberries, dried cherries, a fig jam which was divine, grilled toast and also some smoked almonds. The platter was a lot for two people, but it was our own fault for picking 4 cheeses.

Next was the salad.. husband had house greens and I had the deconstructed Brussels sprouts and spinach salad with goat cheese, walnuts and blood orange. It was amazing.

Had the Riesling and the Pinot Noir. Both excellent.

The entrees were the stars, however. I had pasta pillows with pork belly with a Meyer lemon zest sauce with fresh peppers, and my husband had the lemon chicken...wow! seasoned to perfection and the skin grilled perfectly, served alongside whole red potatoes that were mashed down in the skin. This was, by far, one of the best meals I have ever tasted anywhere in the country.

Finished with Stella Blue coffee, black. Perfect end. Brought home two desserts for the teenagers (and for us to bite into--who were we kidding?!) The custard with salted caramel and cookies and the canollis filled with chocolate ganache.

The chef here is Manhattan trained and it is evident. Can't say any more about how worth it it is to try this place at least once. Foodies will not be disappointed.

This is a very unique dining experience. The house is an old Spanish mansion. The courtyard is lovely, lit up with twinkling romantic lights, and the trees were sultry in bloom. Ah, what a fragrance! A must for lunch OR dinner."
OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"I am very adventurous and I often stop in to check places out first, so I am glad I read the Yelp reviews before I did or I never would have found the place. Sure, you can see the sign out by the road, but the sign announces three separate businesses and there is no discernible entrance. You have to park in the back lot and walk in from the rear. There is no sign above the door. I wouldn't have found it if I hadn't known to look for it, and if I hadn't been brave enough to blindly walk into an unmarked business. You could park on the side, right where you pull in off of Central Avenue, but know that you must go in at the middle point where the two buildings meet, and it feels like a back-door entrance. You must be cool enough to know how to get in the place. (joking).

The menus are shit. Meaning, you really have to look around hard to find the menus--it's not like there is a big wall menu above the counter, which is how it SHOULD be. It makes it tough for people in line to decide what they want, because everyone is craning their necks around everyone else in line just to read the posted menu. It is TERRIBLE. So they should improve on that. However, that being said, the bakery items on display look fab, and to taste them is divine. I wound up grabbing a box of pastries and a coffee to go. Best scones EVER, and worth $3 a piece because they're big.

My Americano was not that good--it tasted like it was made from instant coffee. But at $3 it was big and it was hot and it was coffee. That was okay for me, but I probably will not order that there again. It looks like they have lots of much more interesting choices to choose from, and if I had more time I would have tried something other than my old stand-by.

The food menu exists...you have to use bifocals. But look for it because the lunch and breakfast entrees look WONDERFUL. The seating looks more conducive to coffee and cocktail drinking. There is a big long table inside that looks like you can eat a meal at it. It is community style dining. There are tables in back, and tables outside that look like you can eat comfortably there.

I have to point out that it is the most hipster/pretentious place EVER but in a good way. If you feel uncomfortable being judged by the hipster group, don't go. It is a really cool place and I plan on taking my sister there. She'll love it. My kids would hate it, but they are teenagers and think they're  too cool to be seen there, if that makes any sense. I loved it but in a fishbowl kind of way. I am not that cool, but I liked looking. What will get me back there is THE FOOD!

Oh, and the people are VERY FRIENDLY! :) ...which is always a plus."
Hliq9wrI1BcR-xcG_C9_Qg,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,1,"Mistakenly ordered the chicken fried sirloin. I did this about a year ago and I actually had forgotten how wrong this dish is. This is a special Texas dish that should be so tender one can slice into it with a fork. It should be made with ground sirloin or double tenderized steak. The sirloin at Roadhouse was a thinly pounded out piece of leather with several veins of hard  grizzle running through it.. The fried outer layer was overcooked, over salted and smooth. It fell short of the layered, fried chicken crust this dish should have. They did get the creamed gravy right. The brown gravy is also  good, but salty.

Husband's sirloin was ordered medium well. What he got was charred on the outside, dark pink on the inside, throughout. He had to send it back, and we have never sent a dish back int he 15 years we've been together.

I did not complain about my meal because I realized this is just the way the dish is prepared there. But....I will never order it again. I don't even think we'll bother going back there.

If you do go, the rolls are still yummy and amazing. The beer is still cold and good. Don't bother ordering steak unless you are ordering filet, however, because their steak seems too leathery. It was pretty awful.

We were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible. It is NOT the delicious, tender, forkful of yum from your Texas childhood. It is the stuff of nightmares."
PlTdQdCWu2_hjbSuenB3pg,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"I hardly want to tell anyone, because I want to keep the place all to myself.

WOW.

Be adventurous. Try the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, or the salty plum soda.

The soup bowls are gigantic. The egg rolls come with a platter of greens and dipping sauce. The prices are inexpensive and the service is great.

At 2pm all the tables were full. That tells you something.

UPDATE:

Went the very next day with entire family. We each tried a different rice noodle soup. Everyone liked what they got, but we will note that meat is more of a garnish, so if you want more meat, you should order an extra order of it ont he side, which a lot of people do. But just know that at $6-9 (depending on what kind of soup you order), you are getting a lot of food that will fill you up, if you like a lot of fresh vegetables, noodles and broth. The broth is heavenly.

On our way out we were followed out the front door to be given a rare treat: a macaroon ice cream sandwich, gratis. Now they probably don't make a habit of doing this, but we thought it was very generous, and it tasted out of this world!

This is probably going to be a go-to lunch spot form now on!"
FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"Went again a few weeks ago and our server suggested a great wine. Seems like the service and food here are consistent, and it is easy to find a table if you come early enough."
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"We LOVE Lo Lo's! Went tonight in search of a satisfying dinner and they didn't disappoint.

We both ordered the Lo Lo's plate: three pieces of fried chicken and two generously sized round waffles on each plate! So much food!  Really great stuff, it tasted homemade, like something we'd cook ourselves. It was so comforting and delicious. The service was lightening fast, too. We also like that the drinks are served in big mason jars. Some of the best iced tea we've ever had. Great decor, cool atmosphere. Jazz playing  through the speakers. Very comfortable and welcoming vibe. Lots of smiles from hostesses and servers. Good family restaurant, but also a cute date place!

Cannot wait to go back and try the grits, mac and cheese, etc. Pretty extensive and delicious  looking menu. So many choices!"
-Bdw-5H5C4AYSMGnAvmnzw,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,3,"We thought we'd be back sooner than this and we were hoping for another good experience. It's was just alright. We ordered many small plates and each of us had an entree with sides. The menu changes so don't expect to get the food you see on Yelp in the photos.

Tuck Shop pursues an aggressive flavor profile on every dish they create, including side dishes, which isn't always a good thing.  It's like paying top dollar to listen to an orchestra where every player is a diva. The cacophony is deafening.

We still think Tuck Shop is okay, but this second visit only confirmed what we thought the first time, which is that Tuck Shop ""over does"" and ""over salts"" everything. We came here because our daughter requested it. We go out all the time and we would have taken a pass on this place, but it was what she wanted. We enjoyed the laid back decor, the cool, ambient music, and we thought our waiter was an adorable hipster. Tuck Shop just tries a little too hard for our taste.

Also, if there is one thing we do not like when going out it is when the wait staff responds to our inquiries with, ""It's really, really good. That's my favorite."" I don't want to know what a waiter likes. Taste is subjective. Just tell us what is on the menu and answer our questions without giving your personal opinion, because I'm pretty sure we don't have the same palate.

The cocktails are still very high quality. The fried chicken is still cooked to perfection. The green beans are greasy and way too salty--just like last time. Cauliflower gratin with grits was interesting, but had a sour note, and the brocollini it was paired with as sides was also greasy and salty. There is no excuse for that. Allow the vegetables to breathe for godssake.

You don't need to work so hard to make a good impression. This reminds me of the Mindy Kaling routine: a retarded person shows up to lunch an hour early...in a tux. We'd like Tuck Shop so much more if it let the food be great without over dressing every damn thing on the menu.

And why are you so above syrup for the waffles? For reals? I've had meals sitting in the same room where Reagan used to eat in Washington D.C., but I'm no snob. Waffles deserve some effing syrup. Sheesh. For a place that serves sickeningly sweet medjool dates stuffed with Gruyere cheese *and* spicy chorizo, it should be okay to drizzle maple syrup over a soggy waffle that's been baked with cheese inside of it. Strange thought processes going on there. You're trying too hard to be different.

BOTTOM LINE: Great atmosphere, nice/friendly service, good sized portions, fair prices on all dishes--just too much experimentation, grease, salt and seasonings. If you want chicken and waffles go to Lo-Lo's It costs the same but you get twice as much without the fanfare."
jlcnzJ_0Sr2w3l7Z9HaVow,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"Really good value.
Two visits with the four of us--no one ever got sick.

Let's face it--we are talking about a Chinese buffet here, so don't expect a ""foodie"" review like we usually give, since all of these Chinese buffets offer the same quick fare. For that reason alone our ratings scale is based upon what college professors would consider to be a ""sliding scale"". Therefore let us continue...

We are awarding 4 stars to Lin's Grand Buffet for some specific surprises:

1.) The fried fish and fried shrimp were very good. Like, SURPRISINGLY good, especially since we are grilled fish/healthy eaters (but the grilled salmon that day was ""fishy"", thus the discovery of the fried stuff). Our suggestion is to try a very tiny piece of fish before proceeding further, since cooking varies from day to day.

2.) The cheese enchiladas are perfect. (Weird, right?) But we were craving them that day.

3.) Yummy ""critters"". Our other surprise was that our 19-year-old stuffed his face with little octopus and LOVED them. He had never had them before, either, and the whole thing started as a dare... He also piled his plate several times with the crayfish. All of it gross to us, but obviously not to him. The octopus are tiny and look like little cartoons. The crayfish are just like I remember them from playing in the creeks of Texas as a child.

There is a HUGE assortment of foods here--something for everybody. Ribs are good, but not too much meat on them, chicken wings are good, pot stickers are good. They've got everything you can imagine and more. Salad bar is a disappointment. Not too many healthy vegetable toppings. Very basic stuff there, including the ever present chocolate pudding.

The husband got two plates of Mongolian Barbecue, so to whoever mentioned previously they don't have this anymore, apparently they do still have this feature of the restaurant. Hubby liked it. Said the first cook ""made it great"" and the second cook (when he went back for seconds) ""made it meh"". Depends on your cook, we guess.

The sushi is uninteresting and dry. Full disclosure, we didn't ask for anything specific to be made for us, so we don't know if that is an option here. Can anyone enlighten us? (Thanks.)

The deserts are dry and monotonous--you know the drill on this stuff.

We refuse to call the soft-serve (which comes in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl) ""ice cream"". It is food-grade ""D"" frozen ""treat"". Nasty stuff, eat at your own risk kind of territory. But again, our son, despite himself and God love him, kept going back for more. Blecht!..and LOL! In our humble opinion, this was the worst part of our  visits.

We've always had great/attentive servers. We say the only drawback is the ripped seating. When we asked for another booth on a busy night the hostess laughed and told us that all of the seats are ripped. So, come on, Phoenix! Let's sit properly, mm'kay? This can be prevented. Otherwise the place is huge and kind of cool/pretty looking. It seems clean enough. Bathrooms are new/clean."
19LQmaLOi22V5RrI3eB5lA,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"Best tasting broth in Phoenix. Hands down. Try the raw beef platter, and  fresh coconut juice. Large, very clean restaurant. Service is very friendly here. Be patient if it is busy, as the owner is the only server. It is tucked away in a sketchy strip mall, but TOTALLY worth it!"
0oSWfLMJZnl2HhOc2lQb2g,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"Really, really good hot and sour soup!  Friendliest cook and counter lady, like, ever! You can get a feast for three for $20. The vegetables are perfectly cooked. The rice noodles are also well done here.  The place is great for take-out but there is an ample seating area and tv. It is modern, light and airy and very clean!"

_7u6Cdgoo65xqUNOuRX4Ew,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,3,We had the smoothie with greens added in a bowl. It was very tart. Was expensive! Due to allregies we have to be careful. We requested the gluten-free granola. Not sure if they properly delivered on that one because we experienced a bad reaction later on in the day....so if you're like us maybe try something different if you go. We would go again just to try the juices. They looked good.
Ak08F6RqjHYmVCzweBbTrQ,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"Wow! The smell got me from the moment my dining partner and I entered. I could just tell things were ""right"" about this place. Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.

We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.

I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.

The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.

Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!

If you love Thai...GO THERE!"
-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"We are big fans of Switch for lunch!

It's a sit down restaurant and so you'll pay more than a fast food place, but having said all that the VALUE is incredible. Al the beef is angus. It is cooked perfectly. The chicken is tender, cooked well, without being rubbery or flavorless. The salads are wonderful. The starters are wonderful. And the iced tea doesn't taste like dishwater, which, in Phoenix, is always a great big plus!!

I can't say enough about the food because, well...it tastes like the owner truly cares about quality ingredients, decent size portions, keeping the cost to the customers low considering what you get, and well...just making everything taste truly special.

Inside it is busy for lunch and you might wait 5-10 minutes. It is nice inside, with leather couches to sit in while you wait. It is LGBT friendly, and has a sophisticated vibe. Restaurant and bathrooms are spotlessly clean."
LgMCHBadv9Z8Ge94zNpDFA,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,2,"The service was horrible. We were there almost three hours waiting (...for a table, water, a server, our drinks, our food...). Practically ignored. I got my margarita after waiting 25 minutes for it and it arrived with two melting ice cubes and what looked like several sips missing (compared it to my husband's, which arrived 5 minutes after mine). Very friendly staff, just not good  at taking care of tables. Food is very well seasoned. Tasty. But way oversalted. It arrived cold, and the meat is very dry on the outside. Ordered two appetizers and they were yummy, but only one came after waiting forever, and the second one came twenty minutes later. Our daughter's food arrived, and then ten minutes later my food came, and then it took the owner walking by to see that my husband's food hadn't yet arrived---and then it was at least another 10 minutes more wait.
So that was just crazy. The portions are fair, but the shrimp creole is way overpriced for only getting six medium shrimp. They were clean and fresh, though. Not sure I'd go out of my way to return to this place."
yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"We love food and it is evident on both of our recent visits that the chef at Arrogant Butcher not only also loves food, but respects it, curates it and most important, is consistent with it.

If you are ""into"" food and having a great experience you most likely will find that here.

If you want to put on your feedbag you may not appreciate what this gem has to offer and may, possibly, complain about what you get for your bucks. You are not the droids we are looking for. Move along.

Both visits we delighted in the oysters. Fresh, shucked perfectly, no grit and just the right amount of brine. It would be a crime to overlook these. Sip them. Savor them with the cilantro sauce.

The starters with cocktails are served like tapas. Golden beets, chilled. Generous roasted garlic in oil with crusty bread. The only addition needed on the garlic was salt. Uncomplicated and delicious deviled eggs. The mule we had is is an excellent cocktail. The servers are menu experts on both visits and make excellent beer recommendations.

Visit one we had the sea bass and the beet salad. Our dining partners ordered the pretzel appetizer as a meal. The portions were enough without going overboard. We all were well fed.

Second visit the short rib green chili for both of us. Fried egg white perfect with runny yoke. Absolutely perfect. Seasoned just right. Unique. Warm. Satisfying. Served with a corn muffin crispy and sweet in some places with pockets of butter and pops of green chili. Utterly delightful.

Desert was the salted caramel pudding and the chocolate cake. Both served in half size mason jars and topped with real cream, whipped. Rich flavors, deep and sweet without being cloying. Excellent dark, rich decaf coffee. Exactly what dessert should be.

Service consistently excellent with knowledgeable waitstaff. We were never rushed. Parking was validated. Great experience both times. A new Phoenix favorite for us."
6nbmlMVmbifIjrEEbCaA6w,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"As promised I have returned to Sarajevo Care for another go around. This time I brought a dining partner. I had the steak sandwich and my companion had the gyros sandwich. Again I ordered the cabbage rolls.

The cabbage rolls were better than the previous day if that is possible. They are delicious!

The true star may just be the gyros sandwich, though. I loved my tasty and ample steak sandwich, but I was *this close* to stealing my partner's gyros sandwich. This Is The Place for gyros, folks! Omg!

We finished with the delightful Turkish coffee and our lovely server then brought us each a free dessert ""just because"".

We have such warm feelings for this place. It is on our rotation now. If you are curious you MUST try it!

We suggest the sausages, the bread and tyros and the desserts with Turkish coffee."
Ly2ShApiomYZwKehwb7eRA,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,After my last review which states our $100 cost of a lunch for two (ok...we tried a ton that day)....I wanted to follow up with our visit for a birthday dinner last night. Three of us dining. We each ordered dinners. Two beers for my husband and hot tea for us. $87 total. It was a wonderful meal!
S6TMBqrsi4PLRFoQFPScjQ,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,3,"We're giving three stars overall based on:
1.) Quality of ingredients
2.) 100% Vegan (which is rare)
3.) Gluten-Free offerings
4.) The diversity of the menu, including baked goods and vegan ""ice cream"" treats
5.) Okay, and they also serve alcohol

We can't give more stars because they were not earned.

We'd LIKE to give this place more stars, but we're very discerning. We went twice this week--once at each location. At the Phoenix location my companion had a noodle bowl with tofu, and I had the gluten-free rice bowl with tofu. Each bowl comes with a choice of protein: tofu, mock chicken or mock beef. You're getting charged for it, so you might as well pick one. We shared an artichoke dip appetizer that is gluten-free.

At the Tempe/Scottsdale location we opted for the large size artichoke heart salad. We had to choose a protein (it comes with it) so we chose mock blackened chicken.

We'll start by saying the sauces were terrific (Mongolian and coconut curry). We both enjoyed our flavor choices at each location.

The artichoke dip appetizer was very tasty and we would recommend it.

The downside: Take a close look at the photos and you will see large chunks of carrot and zucchini. While  we normally like these vegetables (we should--we are 90% vegan in our household and have high standards for a diversity of vegetables and food preparation. We also manage food allergies), we did not care for the ""bite"". The vegetables are crisp, about half-cooked, which is usually okay but not in this dish. We are actually used to preparing our dishes with these raw (100% uncooked) because we grate them or spiralize them, but we prefer them fully cooked when they are in large chunks.

Experiment/Note: Try shaving vegetables, grating them, or spiralizing them vs. chopping them into large chunks. You will find that the flavor profile is way different. Especially with a red onion. Thinly sliced is heavenly, but grate them and you're in for a horrible bitter taste that can ruin a dish completely. Super large chunks of red onion in a salad? Unheard of. Yuck. Same goes for carrots and zucchini.

So, the texture and bite ratio of the dish fell short. The large chunks off-set the dish in a negative way. They overpower and it is unpleasant. At home we spiral cut everything, so the bite ratio is evenly dispersed and not overpowering when we're making it ourselves.

Spiral cutting also allows for a lightness to the dish and a fuller plate. We WISH SO BADLY that Green would do this! We get the feeling that vegetarian restaurants serve a bulk of carrot and zucchini to add volume to dishes at a lower cost, and we have the sneaking suspicion that vegetarians eat them this way because no other choices are offered. We take what we can get.

At the Tempe/Scottsdale location our salad (thankfully) lacked the monster carrot/zucchini overdrive. The ""big"" salad did not seem that much bigger than the ""small"" salad. We had a problem with the blackened mock chicken. First, it was overbearingly salty. Yikes. Second, it played havoc on our digestive system later. Apparently we cannot handle processed meat substitutes--but we understand that a lot of people *can*, so we're just putting this out there.

We are of the philosophy that more vegetables are key, rather than simply substituting meat. Normally we avoid all substitutions and go for an abundance of colors....avocado, very thinly sliced red cabbage, spiral-cut or grated carrots, cucumbers, zucchini, etc. This salad had none of that, other than a few tiny pieces of artichoke, which left us wondering, ""Where's the artichoke?!"" Also, the salad contained a lot of very salty, but otherwise pleasantly crunchy, gluten-free tortilla strips.

We get a sense that Green is for people who rely on substitutes, reminding us of ""french fry"" vegetarians. We'd like to see more TRULY GREEN/NUTRITIOUS/LOW SODIUM choices, with more colors. Truly. We mean, we really do. This place has so much potential and it falls short, which is sad because the two locations are surviving in a city where vegan/gluten-free/organic restaurants are hard to come by. Maybe we're going there because there aren't many places for us to go--but you can create more converts if the bites are better.

We want to go back, but we will be disappointed if we do. We'll go back a few times a year, probably, for that special sugar splurge, for sure. The people who work at both locations are cool and totally nice, and the service was good on both occasions.

This is a sad love letter to Green. We *want* to love you. And sometimes we take risks in love. So we are hoping you find it within you to take menu risks with more vegetables in smaller bites, more colors, and no substitutes because, frankly, we don't need them. Give us an abundance of clean eating with those marvelous dressings.

In short: Grate or spiralize your veggies, add MORE kinds of veggies, and cut waaaay back on the salt. Also, give us a protein free option. We will be loyal forever."
90bL34o2KEes9pUnCOm7pQ,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,2,"We have mixed feelings about The Gladly, but we will definitely return at least one more time for the pate' and to give some other dishes a try. The decor is urban minimalist hipster, the lighting is extra dim, and the restaurant was quite loud. There is an outdoor seating area that looks absolutely fantastic. We would go there again just for drinks outside.

Walking in on a Thursday night around 8pm for a late dinner, we were seated immediately by a very welcoming hostess. She told us who our server would be. Our server arrived late on the scene, acting very comfortable and casual--which is nice and all-- but she took her time in getting to us for our drink orders, and then twice as long to bring the drinks. The restaurant was not busy at all, and eventually she got into a rhythm with us. Overall, the service is very dicey--not a professional staff as might be expected at these prices. It's staff they obviously hire off the street without much experience.

I ordered a ""Manhattan"", but she brought me the ""Gladly Manhattan"". It was a nice drink (and pricey), but not what I was expecting. I'm in my late 40's and wanted my parents' no nonsense version of it over ice--so perhaps one needs to specify at this place, although I shouldn't have had to do that. I didn't order the ""Gladly"" version. Anyway, I rolled with it.

My dining companion ordered the egg roll starer and the scallops over grits as an entree. I ordered the pate' starter and a small plate of lamb riblets as my main.

The egg roll was tasty. The scallops were heavy on the bacon fat, which could have been good, but the added pieces of bacon were too chewy, and the scallops were not tender. The flavor was a bit overwhelming with the added pork fat. The dish should have been velvety--it was not.

The pate' was very good. It was the perfect amount for a starter, a nice amount, in fact. They pair it nicely with pickled red onion and capers, along with hot mustard and VERY crispy toasts. Adorable presentation and very good, especially with the bourbon. Not the best we've ever had, but overall quite memorable with the pairings.

The lamb ribs were a let down. Too fatty and not tender enough. The flavor was fine, but underwhelming. They do taste of lamb, but lack the gamey flavor of shanks, which I actually prefer. There was too much gristle on the bone, and the dish was overpowered with more of the pickled red onion. We feel the red onion is perfect for the pate' starter, but just wrong for the riblets. We wouldn't get these again.

We both ordered the chocolate caramel tart for desert. It looked exactly as described, but the crusts were practically frozen. It wasn't pleasant to cut and put into our mouths. The flavor was entirely underwhelming, and we couldn't taste the smoked paprika, the orange bitters...or the salt in the chocolate ice cream--all the very reasons we ordered them. It was boring and disappointing. We wouldn't get those again.

I want to like The Gladly more than I do, so we will give it another shot. There are so many other good restaurants in Phoenix, we don't feel like this one is up to snuff for the price. It isn't that great of a value. They seem to try really hard, though. I guess it depends on how spoiled you are to really good food. If you've been exposed to truly great food you might be disappointed here. It's average upscale dinner fare at very expensive prices."
-8JaNeG3etLgOVyg2gOIiA,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"Been twice. This is our favorite Italian place. We always secure reservations, and this place actually calls you back to confirm if you've left a message during off hours.

We are always seated promptly. The servers have been here for, literally, decades. They treat us like family. Very attentive and professional, and often fun, as well. They make good recommendations if you aren't sure of something. We are usually a large group, but all of us are served promptly and wine kept flowing.

They accommodate celiacs. Gluten free pasta and sauces are tasty...cannot tell the difference. Our food has always been delicious and generously portioned.

Excellent appetizers and desserts. Salad not special, but otherwise standard. Wonderful bread and oil for the table. Be sure to relax with dessert, coffee and Sambhar or port wine.

It is a memorable experience. Old school. Highly recommend!"
SIBaomIYVvsMU0GTuqX4vQ,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,4,"Yesterday I ate lunch here at the sushi bar in back. It was a very good experience. It's kind of a strip mall place, but there is outdoor seating with a pass through bar to the inside, and the vibe inside is trendy and feels like a great happy hour and casual dinner kind of place. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably come here a lot.

I started with the seaweed salad and a bowl of miso soup. The seaweed came out of a very cold refrigerator! I had to turn out the bowl onto a plate and let it rest a bit before eating it. However, the portion size was generous and it tasted good.

The miso soup took me back to the first time I ever had miso--about 30 years ago in NYC. I've got to say, in that time period since there's been a lot of miso soup in my life--a lot of it buttery, cloudy, you know the drill--but the miso soup at Pure Sushi had that throwback taste I hardly ever get to experience anymore. It was smokier, fishier, and I liked that.

I like rolls, but I prefer pieces of fish. That can get tricky if you don't know what your getting is going to be fresh. I rolled the dice and won.

Started with tuna. Five pieces, rich and fresh.

Asked for halibut, but there was not any available (which didn't deter me because that is common at sushi restaurants). So I asked the chef what he likes and he recommended the walu. It was AHH. MAAAZING!!! Walu, also called white tuna, is light, white and buttery. It was served (two pieces) over lovely seasoned rice and had a tiny dab of relish on each piece which was to die for. Such perfect bites.

Because it was lunch it was quiet and only a few tables were occupied. The chef talked to me, since I was dining alone, and that was very nice. He was friendly, made good recommendations, and is a good conversationalist.

I'd totally go here again for lunch. But it looks like they have some pretty good happy hour goodies, too, and if you go for dinner, you can count on it being fresh and to your liking."
2gI7dlktBQXPZiuOW-HWvw,zAE0KDld3sF3Y23viJsXww,5,"Wow! Just love! Sent hubby out to pick up the food. Ordered the smaller portions to save money and so everyone could get what they want. Ordered one dish no sauce and one dish extra spicy. They accomodated all of our requests. We fed six people for under $40, and the food is GREAT!"
e4qQlNEop42LoFBwv71dVw,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,4,"Dining at Ruth's Chris is always a treat.. I have dined at this local, Las Vegas, Nv for my wedding reception in March 2008, and also for a lunch as well as the San Diego harbor location for a New Years Eve Dinner..

If you don't like top quality meats or haven't had them, I defy anyone to find a better steakhouse.. You are paying for the steaks which are served on their signature 500 degree plates with sizzling butter.. I always go for the NYer, a side of creamed spinach..

I have never had a bad service or had to complain about my food. Trust me, I will make my displeasure known, professionally and courteously. You always get more flies with honey than vinegar.

The food at Ruth's Chris is top notch. Sorry to hear about the other reviewers birthday problem. A call to the location and a talk with the general manager would have done wonders the next day.."

GK3wLX9Ichxn7bHeLT0aIg,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,5,"My Wife and I dined at Cork on March 15, 2009 and this time it was for 1 year anniversary. I called earlier in the week to make a reservation and informed them it was our anniversary.

When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away. When we sat down they presented a menu to us that said "" Happy 1st Anniversary Jason & Meg"" ... Such a great personal touch.

For an App we ordered the Lion Paw Scallop & Braised Short Rib with Polenta fry and Wilted Spinach. We also ordered salads I had the Baby Iceberg Lettuce salad.. she had the Organic green salad that has spiced caramel popcorn on top.

For dinner she had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and I had the Grilled Organic Oregon Lamb Chop...  The plates are small portions and just enough for a single person without feeling stuffed.

I would not hesitate to recommend anyone Cork. Their service and friendliness are top notch..

Please try a local non chain restaurant like Cork in Chandler.. You will be surprised and delighted!"
wdCH53icp_R2jJDrCZk42g,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,4,"I have eaten at LCB many times.. I don't like the chain restaurants for mexican food.. I must counter the other review with the positives.

Their salsa is some of the best, its fresh, homemade and a little on the black peppery side.. They serve fresh bean dip (just have to ask now) and warm chips..

I have tried the combo plates, the fajitas and the spinach and cheese enchiladas. The cheese-crisp is huge with generous amount of cheese. I ask for tomatoes on top.. I like their tostadas and crispy tacos.. I try to get a Mango rum Pina Colada which goes well with Mexican food. As for the tortillas tasting store bought, thats news to me.. I think these are far better for restaurant made than most restaurants like Chevy's who makes theirs in plain sight!

If you like the chains of mexican food, Garcias, etc.. give this place a shot, you'll like it!!"
riM-pBsdqRRVXtAVbLfsxQ,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,4,"I have partaked here many times. I dismiss the pickles in the tray that they deliver with the h2o.... What stands out for me is the LARGE amount of food you get, both at breakfast, lunch and dinner..

The Pastrami.. The best in the valley. It is always moist, tender and flavorful, especially on an Onion roll and a couple slices of Provo.. The Maple Turkey sandwich is ok, but can be dry.  I also love the Jewish Penacillin aka Chicken Noodle Soup..

For Bfast I would suggest the pancakes, they are freakin HUGE and tasty. I prefer the whole wheat ones with a touch of cinnamon.

I would eat there more often if they only had Coke products. Pepsi is flat and for wimps!"
6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,5,"Beef or Chicken. Corn or Flour. Beans, Onions and home-made salsa. Nothing compares to it, and nothing beats it. The chicken is  flavorful, but, I wish I knew what they put on the steak for seasoning, because it happens to be my favorite..

Don't go around 12pm-1pm during the week, they have busy lunch crowds from Chase across the street and lots of local government workers as well.  Be prepared to wait 10 to 15 minutes for the food to be delivered to the table, as it is cooking over a wood fire in the kitchen, YES wood fired meat products!!!

If its broken, don't fix it. If you are looking for something more than what they have to offer, walk out the door, there are plenty of options in and around El Pollo Loco. I like the fact they only take cash or checks. This option does put people off, but hey, at least they aren't beholden to any credit company.

Now if they only offered bottled Coke.. But HQ next door has them, so no worries."
2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,5,"I stop in here about once every other week. I first discovered this place in the mid 1990's through an old friend.

They have very friendly staff. The chefs are the best.

I love their chicken kabob plate. I always ask for extra tomatoes and cukes on my salad. Also ask for a extra pita with a side of gyro sauce. Try dipping the chicken kabob pieces in the gyro sauce.

Some people don't need ""atmosphere"" to enjoy really good food!! I think Haji would lose it's way if it was a place to see and been seen! Its better to just sit back, relax a little and savor the flavors. Expect about a 15-20 minute wait for that Chicken Kabob to arrive. Its never rushed and I have NEVER had to send anything back."
YjAo1DBb0YuPE_RWmhNyrA,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,4,"My wife and I dined here for Valentines Day 2009.. Our first visit here. We have both dined at Bloom another of Fox Concepts places.. The menu for V-Day was a prix-fix... I had the Winter Squash Soup (basically was a butternut squash soup), perfectly seasoned with Chive Creme fraiche on top.. My wife enjoyed the warm Brie.. For our dinners she had the Pork Chops in merlot demi and I had the Beef tenderloin with a Green peppercorn demi.. Very good and cooked and seasoned to perfection..

The deserts is where I am negative.. I had the Boca Negra Cake which should be left of the menu.. It is a 2nd rate chocolate cake that my 4 year old nephew could do better.. It was heavy and dry and lacking in real flavor..  My wife enjoyed the Lemon Sorbet with Pistachio biscotti..

I had a glass of of the Madrigal petite Sirah.. For a $15.00 glass of wine, which was good, not outstanding, the price point should be lowered to $10.00 a glass or even $8 or $9.. $15 is too much!!
My first overall impression is the food is cooked to order. Taste is great.. For the first time in awhile, I didn't reach for the S & P... We will try it again, so we can sample other offerings on the real menu."
xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,4,"Now why would anyone say this is just ""YC's"" only more expensive?

Lets see, YC's has frozen shaved beef, pork, chicken and fish..

GG has FRESH steak and beef. FRESH chicken, fish, scallops

YC's has a few vegi's to choose from.

GG has at least twice as many.

I have eaten there about 15 times since it has been open. So much so I have earned a ""free"" bowl 2 times from my frequent dinner card. I wouldn't hesitate to eat at GG anytime..

I also like that there are more choices for powered spices, as well as liquid sauces. YC's pales in comparison!!

I have never had a problem with staff here and they seem friendly enough.

They have Coke products which is always a must have and a plus!!

Sure GG is a little more than YC's, but remember you get what you pay for!!"
dDZqtA1me453GrMtpcpYOQ,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,5,"OK so its simple, just subs. No soups, No salads. I like the #1 Pepe.. The meats are fresh, so are the other fixins. This is a no fuss sandwich joint.

For those of you complaining, go spend $10-$12 for a ""real roast beef"" sandwich elsewhere. This is as good as it gets in the Tempe area or any area. Most places have frozen meats (Its a underground ""tube"" like restaurant) I'm referring to!

The chips are good, I like the BBQ ones. The bread is uber fresh. If you want the hassle eat elsewhere. When I'm hungry and want good fresh eats, JJ's is the place!

PS Jimmy John, Chandler could use one, either San Tan Village, Chandler Fashion Mall or at Gilbert Crossing at Gilbert & the 202 (san tan)"
zrTGcb83AsfyVTMrsCa65A,XrUYUXCeDRMgnHPdCxnO6A,4,"I have eaten here many times before, usually before a D-Backs game or a concert at the arena or Dodge Theater.. I like the Pulled pork  sandwich with baked beans and fries.

Sure it seems like a typical sports bar, but the food is nothing like a Chili's, Apple Bees, etc... Its better. Its more real than that factory crap. The drinks are good, I enjoy a Mango Pina Colada on a warm day before I head to park. I hate beer and cant see spending $5.00 for some watered down piss!

I like checking the out sports/music memorabilia.. I can recall a lot of the concerts I have seen everytime I visit Cooperstown..  The staff is always friendly and the food is always prepared properly. I hope to see Alice there sometime.."

I like the onion rings over the fries. Sure you can go somewhere else to get a steak sandwich for less, but $10 for a combo is a good deal. Its not a $5 footlong (icky)
They serve Coke products the only way to go!"

Very good, bacon is crispy and the sourdough is great..

If your looking for a good small wine selection, check it out. I like they have some hard to find Shiraz which normally retail for $20-$30 bux elsewhere!

The cupcakes are all very good.. I like the red velvet and the coconut.."

Well today I am a little more than pleased.. I had the Demi-Bfast again.. This time with the Turkey-Maple sausage.. The sausage is very good and flavorful..  My wife had the American bfast, the potatoes were very tasty today..

I ended up getting a Chocolate Truffle Cookie... WHOA. very chocoy and soft.. My wife had the Chocolate Chip cook loaded with chippies.. The owner Kierstan (sorry if I spelled it wrong, I gave you my business card-Jason L. Photography) was very nice, stopped by the table a couple times to ask how we were doing, if the food was good and just be nice!!

Now I overheard her (Kierstan)  asking another table if they had visited the bathrooms ( I was like hmmm that's and odd question).. Well EVERYONE must visit the bathrooms here.. I ended up in the Vespa bathroom.. There is a bathroom with recipes written on the walls, one that is mostly black & red, with pics of tattoos people... Just check them out!!

She was talking about the pizzas and suggested the ""white"" pizza next time. We will try this place for dinner I want to try a burger since she said her husband did the burgers over at DLUX in Phoenix..

. Anyone who reads this, WHY stand and wait for up to 1 hour at The Farmhouse next door? Their food is over priced and mainly average fare at best.. They would rather focus on volume than focus on quality.. Maybe they are 1 step above IHOP!!! Go next door to Liberty Market.. MUCH BETTER and less expensive!!"

The food was ok, not out of this world. I prefer Brunchies in downtown Chandler off of Boston and Arizona or  LIBERTY MARKET right next door!!

The only problem with the meal was that the bacon was dried out. It was very fragile. Not sure if this is the norm, but not edible.

After eating at Liberty Market I have determined it to be much better than this mediocre fare from The Farmhouse.. To have to wait for up to 1 hour for this food isn't worth the wait.. I suspect they prefer more about the volume of sheep that come through the door to eat their food, than the quality of food they serve. They cram you in like sardines and serve you over cooked food..

1, just one overcooked item on ANY plate ruins the entire dining experience! I won't be back!"

They also have a nice fresh fruit tray, cheese & crackers as well as some different breads. On the hot side they have a prime roast most of the time, with some other hot items as well.

The desert bar is nice as well. The lemon cake is moist, flavorful and a nice way to cap off a great meal.. Most of the time they have chocolate covered strawberries.

The staff are always nice and alert and friendly.

The best $20 you'll spend in a long time.

Dinner is also a excellent choice. I suggest the lamb chops!"

We asked about the ""Coaches 80th Bday special"" 2 fillets, king crab legs, asparagus & mashed taters for both.. Plus a salad & a desert! And all for only $80.. The fillet was cooked perfectly, the asparagus had balsamic on it as well.. There was NOTHING wrong with the service or the meal. For our desert we shared a piece of 7 layer choco cake..

The place was half-empty (guessing that most people were elsewhere for brunch as opposed to lunch) and yet we were ignored by our waiter (multiple requests needed for him to procure us water, coffee, utensils).

I thought service was great.  But the atmosphere was just felt awkward. The combo of extra loud music with odd selection of the occasional heavy metal pieces and the tiny table with extra large app plates just didn't quite do it for me.

Food wise, it was OK.  Bavette Cacio e Pepe was my favorite dish and came closest to what I expect from  handmade pasta with great fresh ingredients.  Fettuccini e Finocchio fell short of mark, the pasta felt too thick and lack a certain chewiness.  Beef meatball didn't have the comfort flavors that I was expecting, the flavor reminded me of bbq sauce with star anise thrown it.   Slow Roasted Lamb was the most disappointing thing to hit the table.  It was like bland pulled pork.

The late night closing time makes this a tempting spot for downtown Phoenix, but not sure that I would go back anytime soon."

Went there with 2 friends and the food was great and the service was superb.  My friend loved it so much that she is going to bring her Mom on her next visit.

The stir fry shrimp dish was wonderful with large shrimps.  The green bean was so delicious that I want to add it to my next Thanksgiving dinner.  I had a bit of trouble with the bones on the roast duck, but it was finger licking good.  The only miss for us that night was the pot sticker because we didn't like the thick wrapping though the fillings were quite tasty.

I agreed with Nicole that most of the clientele are on the older side, but with the great food, service and reasonable pricing, I could care less how old the people at next table are."
EcRL1BpBvvQ5LnzgtFr8Gw,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,3,"Still high marks on the food, but would have to agree with Chris L on uneven quality of service."
apdb7MGnmnx6nGWBJ0ch_g,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,3,More style than substance.  The garage motif is done in such an adorable way that makes this a great space to hang out.  But coffee is just okay.
4p6Wce7Ed707QS2-yQkvZw,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,4,"Best burger and service I have had in a long time.

1.The burger and fries that I had at this restaurant was the best I have had in a long time. Cooked properly and seasoned perfectly. Fries were fresh cut potato and well disappeared off my plate.

2. The server was kind good at giving recommendations and made the experience that much better. my drink never got empty and attention was paid to what we needed for the table. I have never been more pleased with a wait staff in a long time.

The only gripe I have is parking and the ability to get in can be a little annoying but a good hole in the wall none the less."
j9cVHTAIkliYQp4XoVcsnQ,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,3,Went for the World Cup. The food was good but the service was forgettable. Kinda felt forgotten about through the game drinks not refilled and didn't see the server for 20 min at a time.
mm0qwYzOilFNVV2us5_8Rg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,4,I come in here from time to time to get a fresh cup of coffee. I love that the staff knows everything that they are serving and where it is from. I just find that the place is a little quite from time to time. Some music on the patio would be great. But that is my little gripe for this place otherwise it is perfect in every other way.
ETTzxqOcPuxMqV37y1uhdg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,"This is the best Pizza in AZ that I have had yet. The place is very Vegetarian friendly and everything from the food to the service had been the best that I have had in Phoenix. As I said I walked in last night looking for a new pizza place while moving to the area. Gina was friendly and accommodating beyond what I expect from any food service. I have never felt more welcomed to a restaurant ever. The best part is that not only was the service amazing but the food will keep me coming back alone it is the best I have had ever. I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone I know,"
Wc9UpJhOcdSj7olZkz7SJA,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,"The other night I was looking for a good burger and fries. I found this on google maps right down the street from my house. I decided to try it out. This is the best kind on small burger shack that you can have. Quick service, friendly staff, and AMAZING burgers. This even beats out my favorite burger place In-and-Out. Better ingredients better flavors and local. I will be back and next time I will be needing a jar of Stand Sauce for my fries."
eN8mkjt_q686hGKi-A9ceg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,I was introduced to this place by my Girlfriend on our anniversary. She has been coming here for year. I cannot begin to say enough about the service and the since of community that is present here. The food sealed the deal thought the Lamb is amazing and also go for the tomato to die for because it is. I could ramble all day about how good it is but all I have to say is go and you will not be disappointed.
3Hu-IPhq5I_jyb3YfeHpGQ,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,I recently moved to the area and found tat this Wild Flower was down the street. I found that the service was quick and done right. The food came out in about 6 min. The soup bread bowl was great gotta love that potato cream cheese soup. And the sandwich didn't fall apart. I will definitely be coming back to this location.
NUhHkT1wfXsTLxt_tWwVXw,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,4,I have been here about 4 times now. It has become my go to Thai place in Phoenix. Great portions and very well spiced. The soups are amazing and for the Pad Thai inclined don't think just order. Food separation for Vegetarian is great and I cannot give enough praise for the staff and how friendly they are. I will be back any time I want Thai.
tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,2,"I have been here many many many times. I live down the street and have never had any issues other than a few people having fun and the bar and yelling at times. Other than that great service and food it to be had here.

Edit:Last time I went the food was sub par and no longer Vegan friendly."
oSpCbTguOIcpi-kg6xstUg,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,4,I love coming here for all of my home needs. Friendly service and great staff to joke around with. I have never had a bad time in here. The only problem that I have is from time to time it is a little under staffed at 5 but what place isn't.
VeRHiEbUe_vHprYn8mnezA,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,"This is the best Caffe that I have ever been to ever...

1. The best Italian food that I have had hands down no question.
2. The owner even though it was a full night found us a table and even gave us a free Antipasta.
3. If you have any question on going here don't just do it. You will not find a more down to earth staff and owner anywhere in Old Town."
8796vXaydw2aY_zER0n9uA,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,5,Great food and great service. If you are wondering what the food is like it is a pot pie of sorts with many different fillings to choose. There is no better comfort food than this on a friday night :)
uovqgCcWIqTwUeH_A54t2A,E5EcMcy0_a4aCOFOUxVjBQ,1,I walked in a few months ago to this location and found that service was HORRIBLE. The high schooler behind the counter was rude and very condescending when we asked if she could change gloves for a vegan. We had the employee then roll her eyes and then take a drive through order instead completely ignoring us. Don't come to this location if you are a vegan\vegetarian
WWqdy9PKOSyhLgHIGaNFrA,kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,3,"Totally solid from the standpoint of the food is predictably good, especially the fries, it's open all hours of the night, easy location, only thing that could be improved is the ambience, but then again, maybe that's part of the charm...a little rought around the edges.  Either way, I have no problem going back every so often."
qQCsLGMncJp1xWUGnOKCQA,kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,4,"Cute neighborhood spot. Love the patio! Pet friendly. Great go to for any meal of the day, but especially brunch and happy hour. Friendly staff."
PJVjfGtVc71M0XlUr83teQ,kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,4,"Ordered two pies to go for an impromptu lunch with friends. Pepperoni and Mushroom and the Pear Pizza. Loved them both, as did our guests. Excellent crust and quality ingredients!"
E25-2ssHwsajyGtsllMXaA,kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,3,"This review is from someone raised in Phoenix, so my taste for heavy fried food isn't so accurate compared to my southern counterparts.  I give this a solid rating, if not just for the atmosphere.  Not your typical Phoenix establishment...very friendly, very homey.  I did feel like I took in more salt than I usually do in a month, but the greens were fabulous!  The chicken wasn't my ultimate favorite ever, but still better than anything you can find in the valley."
vBV5IbpTgUKuu2HlneE2NA,kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,4,"The hubby and I have been waiting for this little Taco Shop to open up (hadn't heard of the other locations) and were there opening day.  Great relaxed environment, friendly staff (though it was the first day...so I'm sure they were on good behavior), fair prices ($5 for a burrito) and a ton of sauce selections.  Hubby loved the carne asada and raved about the tortilla...just enough chewy to soft ratio.  I enjoyed the bean burro and we're looking forward to future fun on their patio with friends.  Looks like they have a good happy hour deal and would be perfect for hangin' around a random Thursday night."
Ae5S7cr7TlRUMLOa6E6f0A,kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,5,"Hands down, best Sonoran Mexican food you're going to find in Phoenix.  My family has been going there since before I was born and I love that it hasn't changed a bit.  Their salsa is absolutely perfect, from the heat to the squeeze bottle, there's nowhere better.  We go at least 2 or 3 times a month and will never get tired of Los Compadres."
DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg,kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,5,"Best Indian food ever!!!  I lived in NYC for a while and couldn't find anything quite as good as Udupi.  Great prices (hubby and I can get out of there for under $20 bill).  The Aloo Gobi is perfect and I love their assorted appetizer platter.  Fried goodness!  The staff is very friendly.  I've done the lunch buffet, too, which is fun and great for mixing it up if you find yourself ordering the same thing every time.  Only $8.95!  Took a group of work friends (even some hardcore meat eaters) and everyone left happy and full."
2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"I am so glad I found this place because I no longer have to make baklava when ever I get the craving. Yes I know there are places to get baklava around Phx but they were either too soggy, too sweet, too sugary, too stale, etc. Something was always wrong. But this place is definitely a diamond in the rough. They have a basic selection of middle eastern food like the sherwarma and the kabobs, which are all very tasty and well prepared and much cheaper than the Persian Room (I'm not the biggest fan of the Persian Room bc its just not worth the drive and money unless you are on a date and trying to impress someone). They also have a great selection of baklava like almond, pistachio, cashew, walnut, and the princess which is think is a combination of all the nuts. Regardless of what you get, you will be happy (both mouth and wallet).

The downside is that since it is in a grocery store, its a bit crowded and sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but I don't really mind the wait bc I know everything is fresh and prepared when ordered."
rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"First of all, if you are going to have dim sum, go early during the weekend because that is when the quality and freshness are best. Also go in a large group so that the bill is less for everyone. I have been here a few times on Sunday mornings around 10 am and never have to worry about waiting for a table. They have a decent selection of dim sum dished. My usual's are the ""footballs"", the Hau gau, and the taro cakes, all of which are decent. If you wait long enough, you might be able to get your hands on the coconut pastries called ""snow balls"" which are very enjoyable. In a hungry group of 4, you can expect to pay $20-25 total as a group and not want to eat anything for the next 6-12 hours."
5FIOXmUE3qMviX9GafGH-Q,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"New american veggie restaurant. ...pretty darn good! The fake meat is cooked well and has a good texture. We ordered the bowls, one with noddles and the other with brown rice and both were full of flavor and did not taste like what you would normally expect out of a vegetarian restaurant...it didn't tasty ""healthy"", it tasted good. We also got the spicy edamame.

Love the taste and the flavor, only flaw is the price point. I would come here again, but if the price was $2 dollars less on each item, I would come here at least once a week."
OJaODLWh3YtZPK5V5L_CnQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,2,"NOTE: This review is only about the smoothies/juices

Sadly I really wanted to like this place, because I've been looking for a decent local juice bar...and I apparently still have yet to find a good one! I decided to order 2 juices. but couldn't find one that screamed ginger (I love ginger), so I asked the girl behind the counter what she would recommend and she mentioned that they can add ginger to any of the drinks. I decided to get the Pucker Up! and Berry Me Alive, both with ginger. I was hoping to get a small to try, but the size didn't seem worth it for $4.50 plus extra for ginger, so I got both in a medium size.

The Pucker Up did make my lips pucker but not in a good way. It was bland and sour and I could feel my stomach acids churning. The Berry Me Alive tasted like a cup of frozen berries. Yes, I know frozen fruits are practical in such places, but I've never had berries that tasted so lack-luster. Also, I don't know how much ginger I get for 50 cents, but it wasn't enough because I couldn't even taste it.

For 2 medium drinks plus ginger, the total can to about $13. So not worth it! Don't plan to ever waste my money here. I'll just drive to Thrive in Gilbert for now."
5AuwZcLcGIpe1yhSKgSwlw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,3,"The pho is good but I had one BIG problem. I ordered Spring Rolls and they never brought the peanut sauce. I've never been to a place where peanut sauce did not come with my spring rolls.

Also, the three bean desert was a bit disappointing.

I will agree, the place is authentic, but I guess I'm just spoiled by Pho restaurants in OC (Little Saigon)"
9Cq_NVvWZOEAzmE7tqJgmg,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"I absolutely love their hot dog creations. They have very different and unique flavor combination and they are served on naan like flat bread, not the same old hot dog bun.

My personal favs are the Aiko and the Moki. All hot dogs cost $5 which i'm willing to pay for these tasty puppies!"
JQYkVnUzS5vgFxZgCuW7ag,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,2,So the owner/management has changed so not my first place to drive a long distance to!
d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"So we've been looking for gastropubs in the area and the first to pop up on yelp is this place. We decided to drop by the place after a not so wonderful experience at a concert and this place really made me feel a lot better. The food and ambiance are great! We got here pretty late so I was surprised they were willing to seat us.

We had the 'Tender Belly' Pork Belly Pastrami, 'Kilt Lifter' fondue, and we were intrigued by the ""Pig in the Orchard"" Bread Pudding so we ordered that as well. The prices are a bit high (every thing we ordered averaged $10), but everything tasted great so no complaints about the price from me. The service is a bit hit or miss hence the minus 1 star but I will definitely be coming here again."
cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"I came here about a month ago, just randomly on a weekend, because we were looking for a decent breakfast/brunch place. Luckily, this place was listed in my bookmarks. The food menu is not huge but it covers the ground in terms of variety. Their beverage list actually seemed longer.

Anyways, we ordered the deviled egg dip and chips and Russian roulette for appetizers. The dip was amazing and the mix of peppers in the russian roulette were great. I suggest taking a small bit to test the peppers if you're not sure. For entree, we ordered the Veggie Stack and  Porkwich. Again, another hit and the veggie stack was a pleasant surprised...it was relatively healthy and tasty. We had a few of the sides but the only one I remember is the mac n' cheese. If you come here, GET IT! It is some of the best mac n' cheese I've had in a long time.

For dessert, you can just head next door to Churn with is an old school ice-crean and candy shop.

The prices were on the reasonable/slightly expensive side. For the food and service, I will definitely be making a drive back to downtown PHX soon."
59OgPGGzKFYqwSG_U06kuA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"I've come here many times and always enjoyed my bowl of hot tofu soup. I came here initially because I was craving something similar to Tofu House in San Diego. I also went to Takamatsu and Hodori  because these 3 were in a way in competition for best Korean food-faire. This was the first I tried and the one I have continued to come back to.

They have a decent selection of hot tofu soups  which is served with stone pot rice, which I love, especially at the end when the rice gets crunchy as the end. Their selection of kimchi sides is extensive and tasty. I don't think half of them are really authentic but they taste good so I won't hold that against them. Also, the price is good as well."
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"Well this was a pleasant surprise.  This place is small, a little cramped, but the food definitely makes up for it.

When seated, the waitress was very attentive and coffee was served almost immediately. The menu is small, but full of all the basics, along with the special of the day.

My fiance ordered the special, while I ordered the salami scramble. They are served with toast (white, wheat, sourdough, or cinnamon raisin) and potatoes (hash browns or country fried potatoes). We ordered the wheat, which was served with a chunk of butter melting between the slices and a small cup of jelly. The toast was served almost immediately after taking our order and it was full of nom noms. The service is fast and you never have to wait for a waitress to come by. There is always someone nearby to help.

The prices were very good as well. The average cost of entrees is between $4-8 dollars and the coffee has free refills. The amount of food served is just enough to fill you up with out making you feel like a glutton.
They don't take reservations and the place is very small with limited seating so either arrive early in the morning or expect to wait a while."
fT6Uwl6abRQfiNgxre_qbg,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This place was pretty interesting. I never thought of japanese and italian being a fusion combo, but here it is.

The italian food was different, but not worth it. My fiance ordered the TanTan-Men and Gyoza and wow, you definitely get what you paid for. So much food and large pot of ramen. The prices are reasonable, approx $10 per person, maybe a little more if you order drinks and/or dessert."
xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"A darn good Pizza!

We've been here twice so far, through the recommendation of a friend. The location is not the greatest and you would never expect how great the quality of the pizza is.

The first time I went there, I got two 7 inch pizza's, I'd say this is a personal pan pizza size. I got the Spinach Pie and the Santa Fe Chicken with Original Deep Dish Crust (they have a Thin Crust option as well). The Santa Fe Chicken was good, eventhough the chicken was a little dry. The Spinach Pie was AMAZING!!!! This is what a vegetarian pizza is suppose to taste like...pure awesomeness!

The second time, I got a 12 inch (enough for 2 people and/or left overs): half Pesto Bianco w/ chicken and half BBQ Chicken with Wheat Deep Dish Crust. The chicken yet again was dry, so I was noticing a team with the chicken. Luckily I don't judge a pizza place by it's chicken, so that bodes wel for Nello's. I can understand how chicken can dry out during the cooking process. As for the pizza itself, the BBQ was decent (it reminded me of a generic CPK BBQ chicken pizza) and the Pesto was pretty good. All in all, it was the wheat crust that sold us this time.

Thus far, I would recommend the Spinach Pie with Wheat Deep Dish Crust!"
GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"OMG, I feel like I'm on a role with finding half-decent Indian food. After being here for over 2 years, I'm either finding some good places or my taste-buds have lost their touch. Since I refuse to believe the later, I was VERY happy with this place. Great place for dosa...finally I don't have to make it myself :) Seriously legit dosa!

We ordered rasam, the Grill Thali and a rasmalai. The Grill Thali is about $10 and is a good start if you want a general idea of what to order in the future. It came with masala dosa, idlli, vadai, sambhar, and a sweet (gulab jamun)... great value for what you get. The masala dosa was on par, vadai was made well, idlli was a bit dense and dry, sambhar was flavored well, and gulab jamun was not frozen (I've found way too many places that store it in the freezer and it kills me every time!). The spice level of the rasam was good but felt like it was missing something, possibly tamarind. The rasmalai was made well, but a little bit sweeter than I'm use to. All this for approx $16 for 2...My tummy was happy!

Woodlands is not the best place ever, but the dosa was good enough to make me want to come back to try the other types of dosa. Everything else was satisfactory and edible. I've noticed a lot of ppl critiquing the decor, but heck, it looks like a lot of the great places in Artesia (the little India area located in L.A.) so please don't come here if you're going to be critical of the cafeteria style."
ufltmPizIHWx4MjnOzf_Sw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"For the price, the sushi and sashimi are decent. The best time to go is during happy hour where sushi/sashimi are half price, so 5 orders can fill your tummy and not leave your wallet empty."
VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,2,"I was disappointed, the food is just too bland!

My husband and I ordered a variety of food to get an idea of there food spectrum: Garlic Chicken Kabob, Lamb Vindaloo, Palak Paneer, Garlic Naan, Gulab Jamun, and Rass Malai.

The only positives I saw was that the meat was cooked well...that's it! The sauces for each dish lacked flavor and spice. My husband even requested Indian spicy and it wasn't even spicy...it tasted like a mild. The Garlic Naan was decent.

At this point we were going to give it a 3...barely! Then the desserts came...

The gulab jamun was firm and frozen and it seemed like they added extra butter/ghee to the syrup. The Rass Malai was too thick and creamy, it seemly like it was soaked in heavy cream, which messed up the texture of the paneer. And after we saw the bill, their score plummeted to 2.

It was not worth it. So many of my classmates have gushed about how great the food is, but I realized, they probably dont know any better. I grew up near Little India around LA where good Indian food was no hard to find, so I could just be spoiled."
aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This place is expensive, but the food is made to order and of high quality. We went here for the Sunday supper, which is a 3 course meal for $35 per person and I was stuffed. The bread is amazing and the olive oil was very tasty.

For the first course, we had a choice of shrimp louis or salad. I went for the salad, because I'm not must of a shrimp fan. I was a little worried about the salad because it had blue cheese, which is a hit or miss for my taste buds, but that was a very tasty salad. They offer supplement dishes for an extra $10, which my finance got and it was worth it! The second course offered a choice of cioppino, southwest burrito, or gnocchi. The clams in the cioppino were perfect and the burritos were tasty...but i do wish they provided more salsa. The last course was dessert, which was a house-made It's-it and its probably the best ice cream sandwich i've had in a restaurant. Overall, I was very happy with the service and Elliot, the owner, is very hospitable and friendly.

The atmosphere is a bit dark for me but I understand it's to provide a romantic feel."
tWiFat101ID5w_wgAPMXhA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"Now this is what I call a good hot dog!...Not just good, they are GREAT :) This what a ballpark hot dog is suppose to taste like...and cost. The  value is amazing for everything you get.

Oh, and I tried the onion rings after reading all the great reviews and they truly are some of the best onion rings I've ever had.

By the way, I am usual not the type to get up to order seconds, but this time, I couldn't help myself...just had to have another!"
XVS-zdj4Z6TihagZcZZ7pQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"Pretty decent and fresh sushi, for AZ. Prices are great, especially during happy hour. It's a little more expensive than other sushi places in the area, but still affordable. Expect to pay approx $20 per person for a full meal (appetizer plus entree or a couple of rolls/nigiri)"
r5PLDU-4mSbde5XekTXSCA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This was a random surprise. It looks like a market but then we realized that the restaurant menu and ordering area is in the back , with the tables interspersed among the grocery isles. The market itself has a great selection of pasta, sauces, biscuits, and wine. The food itself is great.

The menu was huge and I kinda got lost in it so I ended up ordering a half turkey and provolone sandwich on nine grain, a cup of minestrone soup (which came with bread) and a side meat ball. The sandwich was good, it wasn't the best but good for the price. The minestrone was yummy. And the meatball was AMAZING!!! My fiance had the cheese steak sandwich, which was very tasty, but the clam chowder was pretty bland.

The wait was a bit long, but we really were not in a hurry so it was not a big deal. Also, the salads looks great. The next time I come here, I'm definitely getting another meatball, maybe try one of the other hot sandwiches and one of the salads."
sdKB_8mv4f0Vd4GKfQmqBQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"I absolutely love this place and its next to JoBot which is another plus. Great selection of nachos, all for about $7 with great ingredients and a unique combo of flavors. Plus, its open really late, I think until 4am on the weekends, which makes this my new favorite place to hit up when those late night junk food cravings hit and I don't want Mexican food. The price is a little high, but you get a lot of nachos for what you pay for."
R-Jmd1zLAyGsN5uP_hJx3g,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This place was definitely a surprise. I'm from LA and had to move here. Lets just say moving to a state without an ocean in site makes you a little skeptical about the sushi.

They're happy hour specials are a great deal and the sushi was pretty fresh and tasty. Also, they have a great selection in sashimi.

They have good food, great service, all for a reasonable price.

Btw, the avocado salad is tasty, but extremely large portion. Good to split with someone else."
j2bx_ctb_ED3zbfSaqhQmQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"Amazing food and drinks, but sadly a little too pricey for me...luckily someone else paid!

I liked Roaring Fork because it has a wide range, yet short list, of food, good portions, cooked well, and I definitely got my moneys worth with the Huckleberry Margarita. The seared Ahi, green chili pork stew, and short ribs were delicious. I took off one star because the place was too dim, and we were with a few children, and this place is not kid friendly. And as usual, it just cost too much!"
GdMRHtxg2oD5E2WzZccOqA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,3,"Warning: This review is mostly based on service and lack of information, rather than food!

We came here for happy hour and I was going to give this place 4 stars, but they get minus 1 for not advising us where to sit for happy hour prices... and no, I didn't think to ask ""geee...what is the designated happy hour seating?"" We were the first people there and they just told us to sit where ever we wanted. Also, by the time we left, there was only one other couple and they were definitely not getting the happy hour prices either.
Note: Happy hour seating is ONLY at the bar and bench.

The food and selection was tasty but I've had better in San Diego. I guess I need to try the other tapas joints in the area to provide a better comparison. And I do agree with others that it is a bit pricey, but some of the dishes were worth it. The red sangria was lack-luster. The lamb was good, but small for the price. The croquettes were a little bland. I think my favorite was the Patatas Bravas with was just roasted potatoes covered in a tomato sauce. It was very basic but tasty and satisfying.

The bill came to approx ~$60 without tip, and when we checked the happy hour prices on some of the items we ordered, we ended up paying an extra $20 at least to sit at a table instead of the bar."
_wzOIEtLYEp0FftxGwV2zg,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,2,"If you like bland, salty, greasy Chinese food...this place is for you. I'll just head across the street to Chow's Kitchen."
b3wgQ6CccBO8fgvlbS0M1Q,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This place is very delightful, its just a pity that the location is so obscure that they will have to move soon if they plan to keep their business alive. As many have said, it is tucked in the middle of many large buildings and since the AMC is under construction, the business has dropped considerably.

Anyways, the review the food, we ordered the highly yelp reviewer recommended chocolate croissant, the ham and cheese quiche and a last minute decision of the almond croissant.

Chocolate croissant: The pastry is flaky and has the right amount of chocolate. The chocolate filling itself is not too sweet and would definitely be a fav for dark chocolate lovers.

Ham and cheese quiche: it was good, no complaints at all!

Almond croissant: This was a surprise and we actually preferred it over the chocolate croissant. It was buttery, gooey and flaky with a hint of almond and powdered sugar. Again, not too sweet and finger lickin' good.

Like many have said previously, it is a bit pricey but considering my mouth was happy, I didn't mind. If and when they decide to move, I will be sure to check their website and follow them to their new location.

Side note: if you are planning to come here, be sure to call because they have had to decrease their hours of operation. Also, they had a sign that said they will not be serving dinner in August."
kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"First off, I have never had Cambodian food so I might be biased....but this has been one of the best meals I've had in Phx (for the price)!

Since my fiance and I have never tried any Cambodian food, we thought we'd try a good variety:
Jasmine Tea (hot): Good tea, very floral and aromatic
Spring Roll: It was HUGE and similar to Vietnamese spring rolls. Order 1 and you'll have enough to split with someone else.
Pleah Beef Salad: Never thought I'd ever eat or like beef in a salad but it wad a wonderfully clean and refreshing taste.
Loat Cha: I've never seen this type of noodle! It was serves with egg and beef and one of my favorite dishes of the evening.
Noumpang Pate (Pork and Pate Sandwich): Good sandwich and nice bread for $3...similar to those Vietnamese sandwiches.
Banana Tapioca Pudding: This was a banana with a texture similar to a plantain, that was submerged in a hot bowl of tapioca and coconut milk. Very simple and enjoyable, and a 3$ for 2 people, I can't complain. It's a great dessert to finish the meal off.

So, all-in-all, we got out of there with 3 entrees, an appetizer and dessert for under $30...WOW!

If you couldn't figure it out by now, Sekong has gained two new repeat customers :)

FYI: this place is difficult to find if you are driving west on Indian School Rd and you won't realize you passed it until you see the 99 cent store. So after 16th St and 13th Pl, keep an eye out for a sign that says parking in the rear and drive into the parking lot, otherwise you won't find this place until you make a u-turn...the sign is visible when you are driving east."
tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"Thank you Phx for not completely sucking in the Indian food sector. This place was a surprise. I won't compare it to anything in LA, because its hard to beat their cost and taste. But the food was affordable and the flavors were enjoyable.

When I ate the murg makhani or the beghan bhatra, I wasn't angry! Everything tasted fresh, the dinner buffet looked good, and the owners are very hospitable. Sooooo much better than Guru Palace...I don't understand how anyone can eat there.

I didn't have the dinner buffet, but since it looked fresh and included lassi and chai, $9 seems like a great value and will definitely indulge in it next time. At the end, they gave us some gulab jamun and it was warn and cooked well...not frozen, thank gawd!

My only complaint is that the spice level was a little low for us, but considering the lack of decent indian food in the area, it's really not a make or break thing. With everything we ordered, plus leftovers, we got out of there for less than $30."
m8Cbph-0tlMaYyXDwvKc3A,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,1,"NOTE: I came here for the pho, not the happy hour beer or bar food.

This is quite possibly the worst pho I've had in a long time. It was bland and the hoisen and siracha did not help. I ordered a salty plum drink and it came 30-45 min later, after asking about it 3 times so obviously I was a little pissed at the service. Also, I've never had a red berry flavored salty plum drink. The server was not knowledgeable about the menu at all and even forgot the side of rice my friend ordered, but was still charged for it. To top things off, the pho was expensive.

I'd say the best part of the meal was the spicy chicken wings, which was the first thing we got and went down hill from there.

So we ordered chicken wings, summer rolls, 2 bowls of pho, 2 drinks and stir fry noodles with a side of rice = $60 including the automatic 18% gratuity from  the Living Social coupon. There a ton of other pho places in Phx where the same amount of food would cost $30-40. If you just wanna go for happy hour and/or some late night pho, be my guest!"
Ly2ShApiomYZwKehwb7eRA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,3,"So, we decided to come here because of the reviews and well, I wasn't very impressed, especially after such a long drive.

I was content with the sashimi and happy that they didn't charge extra when they served extra hamachi, but was a little irritated with the rolls. The cucumber rolls were dry, and the spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail rolls were mediocre at best. Overall, the quality of their sashimi was good, but you'll have to pay for it.

A little to over priced for what we ordered. Probably won't be making a second trip here unless we are in the area."
dA7ORbBrCdxoMlvn3I6JDA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"I proclaim that this is the best sushi/sashimi I have had thus far in Phx. I love sushi but its been so hard to find a place that has good enough fish where it reminds me of eating clouds (yes, good fish should taste more like clouds than fish!)

Anyways, the 5 stars is not because it is the best fish I have ever had, but it is the closest thing I have gotten in the state. The price is higher than other sushi bars in the area, but once you try it, you'll understand why. The quality of fish it top notch and the sushi chefs will even tell you which fish is in season. I first ordered a sake bomber (large beer and small sake) for $6.50. We ordered the Agedashi tofu and mixed veggie tempura. The tofu had a great soft, almost custard like, texture and tasted perfect. The tempura was good, nothing exciting to note. For entree, we got the Chirashi bowl, a spicy yellowtail roll, crazy roll, yellowtail sashimi and albacore sashimi. The chirashi was a very pleasant surprise with the amount of fresh cut fish but what solidified our decision for best sushi in AZ thus far, was the sashimi. The albacor was PERFECT and made me reminisce about the best sushi I had in Seattle, which did taste like clouds in my mouth. The dessert special of the day was crepes and they made my mouth very happy and was a perfect end to the meal.

Overall, with the Yelp Check-in and 10% off our bill, we got out of there for $81 including tax and tip. As a said before, not cheap but not a bad price considering all that was ordered.

Note: if you plan to come here on a Friday, its best to make a reservation because it can get crowded. Also happy hour is until 7pm."
qJf61TR4Jq9Xph5RiXPS9A,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"I've been looking for a crepe place ever since I got here and finally found this place, the only place! Great place to go for dessert crepes. They are a little pricey for my taste, but I thought the crepes were practically perfect.

The crepes were not too thin, not too soggy, and overflowing with nutella, strawberry and bananas. I have not tried the savory crepes yet. The only reason I take one star off is because of the hours of operation, they close by 4, which did not make me too happy."
Clq09vq8uOjAbGY3BaQWDQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,2,"I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old....Never again! Chodang, here I come!"
QD1cjsSFtktPNtUDJWb--Q,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"I am usually happy with their pho, unlit I go back to OC see what its really suppose to taste like. Everything I've tried here has been good with good portion sizes. My only qualm, which is the same for many other pho places in the area, it the lack of chicken pho broth for the pho ga, its always beef based. Also, I've noticed that every time i come here for chicken pho in the morning, the broth is not fully cooked and is a bit oily, which is why I've made the switch to vermicelli bowls during these times."
GWnhc3MO4XjsKIpyExV--Q,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,3,"I've come here for lunch a few times, mostly out of convenience, but this place is pretty decent for the value/price. Every time I've been here, I've always gotten the Lunch Combo E: Spicy tuna roll (8 pc) and Spicy yellow tail roll (8 pc) for approx $7.50 with tax. So far, I have not been disappointed, but then again, these are some pretty hard rolls to mess up."
cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This place is great. The food is Northern Chinese similar to Chinese Muslim food. They have a great variety for reasonable prices. Also, everything is freshly prepared and you can even see them make the dumplings and pork pie behind a glass window.
We got the stir fry spinach (bok choy) with garlic, sesame bread, pork and napa cabbage dumplings, pork pie and green onion pancakes. I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon.

Side note: They sell bags of frozen/take-home dumplings. About $10 for a bag of 40."
S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This is an amazing noodle house. The noodles are fresh and prepared in front of you (well, actually behind an open window into the kitchen, but its good to know the kitchen is clean.)

Only come here for the noddles, everything else is not that great. This is why I removed 1 star. We ordered the gyoza multiple time, both steamed and pan friend, and they were different every time. We usually order them because its $4 for 8 pieces, and its not the regular size you are use to, they are ""Super-sized."" Don't waste your time with the boba, they are not prepared well.

We come here every week, because we get full off of a large bowl of noodles, for cheap! The average entree is at most $7-8 which I think is a great value for fresh noddles."
A6nY4SCrMuLPtlbq-EKnfA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"Note: this is a review based on food, I don't drink wine!

I've been here twice and thought the food was great both times! The bruschetta is a must and enjoyed the first four listed on the menu. I cant recall what they are but I'm always happy with them. The place is a bit noisy and pricey. To avoid the noise, I suggest sitting outside because it is well shades, and you can actually talk to and hear what your friends have to say. Also the inside is a bit crowded for me.

My finance and I kinda stick out like a sore thumb as this place because it predominately caters to older middle-aged Caucasians, and we are quite the opposite demographic, but I wont hold this detail against them.

The reason I remove a star is because the cost is a bit hefty. If you come here for wine during happy hour, its a great deal, but not so much for the food, hence my initial warning that this post will only be about the food."
P8IsTiHq5Hesa6UPL604ww,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"If you want street tacos that will remind you of the ones you get south of the border, this is the place to be! Their horchata tastes like home-made as well. My fiance loves the bombero burrito, but beware because it is big and spicy. Every time he orders it, I need to have a bit because it is so tasty but he needs to stop me because I have horrible heart burn problems."
Bb-Y-gKgZJak83zfzQoj1g,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"I have never really had a full German meal, but wow, this was tasty. We ordered the sausage special and a schnitzel plate and were stuffed. Each dish is served with 2 sides, one potato based and another cabbage based. The waitress is very german and such a sweet lady, very helpful with offering advice about what is on the menu. The beer selection is amazing. Before our meal was served, we received a few slices of rye bread with butter, and loved it! With all that we ordered, we got out of there in under $25. This place is a great value, especially if you want to leave stuffed."
0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"Lets start off by saying that Nobuo is an artist. I booked a reservation for the omakase (sp?) a few months in advance, and was served 7 courses by the chef at the chef's table. It usually ranges from $100-150 per person, depending on the day or season, right now its about $135.  The food was delicious and I never knew I would ever eat caviar or foie gras, and actually enjoy it."
PRbIMseOwPCCRv5C4SfTDQ,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"Awesome place with huge portions. I like to go during happy hour and get a few appetizers to make a full meal, full of variety. Love the Strawberry lemonade, love the biscuts, love that Memphis BBQ sauce. So Tasty!"
_9vGmNrEcLWFOnUzeUdfag,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"First of all, I did not expect to come into a cafeteria style eatery. They serve the basics of BBQ, nothing too fancy. A few appetizers and side options, like cheesy potatoes, baked mac n' cheese, fresh corn bread, etc. All were very tasty.

For entree, they have a wide variety of meats and combos and samplers. Overall, this is a great place,... meat was well prepared, a little pricey for what I was expecting."
0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"This place was pretty awesome and I'm glad we found it. Not only is it in a wonderful location (for Phoenix) next to the canal in Scottsdale, but the food is really good too. My fiance and I ordered a lot of food without realizing how much food we actually order so I was great for left overs the next day.

We ordered the pear and gorgonzola flat bread, the crab dip, trout beignets, corn enchiladas, glazed salmon, and the side order of smoked gouda mac n' cheese...all for about $80. So between 2 people and multiple extra servings to take home, it was well worth it. The portions are great and not claim jumper large, the quality is great and the service was awesome as well. The to-go containers were separated and labeled so the hash that came with the salmon was in a separate container and the salad that came with the enchiladas were done in the same manner as well.

I will definitely come back to try more food, but this time we are going to try to not order as much so we have room to try and judge the desserts."
zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,5,"I've never had afghani food, but if this is what its like...i love it! It's like a combo of indian and persian. The naan s not like the naan you'll get as an indian restaurant, but its still good, more crispy. We ordered the afghani kofta and mixed grill platter. I was a little worried about ordering the kofta because the grill platter is HUGE!. But after trying the kofta, I was glad I ordered it...juicy meatballs surrounded by well cooked and seasoned lentil curry. The meat from the grill is cooked well, not too dry. Sadly did not have room for baklava or any other dessert, but we did leave with a lot of leftovers. It's also at a good price point so they definitely have gained a repeat customer."
g-I48SaHtdIGR5ZEoVeNFw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"So I finally came back to try the Japanese dishes for dinner. I got the Chiken Katsu Donburi for $8.50. It was a huge bowl and definitely got my moneys worth because I could barely finish even half of it. My fiance got the Spicy Miso Ramen with Mini Gyudon combo for $11. The soup base was good, but the meat was not as good and I wish there was more noddles. And yet again, a large portion of food for a good price. We also got the Melon Cream Soda, so we made it out of the restaurant for $25 total.

Overall, the best ramen I've had in the city, minus the meat, and all for a good price. I didn't try the sushi again for fear of not being happy again. If you come hear, stick to the Japanese food, not the sushi (regardless of the vast selection)."
Z2fCgJdvjhZVP34V86UKCg,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"This is the only place I come to when I have a donut craving. Much better quality , taste and price than Krispy Kremes and Dunkin Donuts. They are always open, fully stocked and I have yet to have a bad experience of a stale donut. The ladies behind the counter are always nice, patient, and willing to answer questions. It also doesn't hurt that they have a fridge with a wide selection of breakfast/dairy beverages. I love these donuts because they taste great and the texture is even better. Its a great balance between the fluffy interior and subtle crunchy exterior."
zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,4,"I actually enjoyed this place and it was a pleasant surprise to find a good yet casual Italian restaurant that didn't remind me or the Olive Garden. The calamari was great and it was a huge serving so by the time we were done with the calamari, bread and salad, I was pretty much ready to go home. But before we realized that, we had already ordered dinner. Luckily we requested half portion with the other half placed in to-go containers so we were not complete gluttons. The service was great and the seating outside was pleasant, less kitschy than the inside. Only problem with sitting outside are the bugs because of the greenery growing around the restaurant. The cost for the meal was reasonable, about $50 for 2 entrees, an appetizer, 2 drinks, and dessert."
5Ktv5ZmJI0CN4L0KxDWJvw,N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug,3,"I was very content with this place and was going to give it a 4 star but having to pay $10 for an egg white frittata kinda made me not so happy. We came here because we were in the area and ordered the egg white frittata, PCG burger and griddle corn cakes.

Egg white frittata: good but nothing amazing to note.

PCG burger: the the fried jalapenos were made with fresh jalapenoes and since we didn't feel like getting a side of fries, we got a cup of chili for a dollar extra. Overall a large and good burger.

Griddle corn cakes: this reminded me of a tamale without the corn husk. This was probably the best thing we had. This consists of two corn bread-like pancakes that sandwich chicken and cheese, topped with pico de gallo and a side of beans. Together, its a great and delicious combo.

The bill came out to about $40 with tax and tip, the servers were attentive, but the location is a bit hard to find."
dUffgo9Lh_Vk9TLuFR5ywg,SWw6UreEI0KRej3lQ48uxQ,5,"This is one of the true Arizona restaurants, and I recommend this place to anyone from out of town. Well, anyone in town too. The staff is extremely fun and nice, which is hard to come by these days.  The food is awesome. gigantic portions, but all the better to take home and enjoy the next day (or two...). The pizza and salads are my favorite, and of course one cannot forget the glutenous wonder of the pizza cookie (formerly the pzookie). This brings ooey gooey goodness to a whole new level.

The only downside... Its size, but that is part of their schtick. Get there early, whether it is lunch or dinner or expect to wait a long time. Trust me though, it is well worth it. Oh and parking sucks too. Again the food and service are worth it the inconvenience.

Unfortunately, after that it is just ok. The service was ok, the food, some good, some not so great. I guess it is hard to expect great seafood this far from the ocean, but I have had better here in the valley.

On top of that it is underground, so if you are unfortunate enough to go on a day Sally and Bob decide to bring their rug rats, (think acoustics and screaming children) the whole thing just sucks. It is also quite expensive for my taste. $100 for 2 people and no cocktails."

This is one of those places the service kinda sucks, emphasize kinda, but the food it so good it doesn't matter. The salsa is yummy, and they have great chips.  Stop your chain addiction  and try out one of these great local favorites!

p_uGLv1QXHBrwya6meztxw,SWw6UreEI0KRej3lQ48uxQ,5,"What a beautiful place, that I had no idea existed. Thanks to restaurant week and Quiessence being booked we decided on this lovely place for our 4th anniversary.

The atmosphere is quite wonderful. I couldn't believe the old rustic barn (that they hold events in) was so charming. They have little white lights everywhere outside, making it quite enchanting. They have indoor and outdoor seating (no misters for the hot months).

The service was very good. Not too ""in your face"" and there was no searching for our waitress for drink refills, etc. A+

The food was really good. We are not usually big on the fancy-smancy food of more upscale restaurants, but we were both pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food. I had the Serrano tortilla soup - VERY good, but a bit spicy so beware. I loved it. My husband ate the trout and beet salad and he thought it was good - but a little out of his normal comfort zone for flavors. We both enjoyed the Brazino (Sea Bass) in saffron broth. That was good - not outstanding but still quite tasty. It was followed up with some sort of corn cakes, goat milk ice cream and chili infused whip cream. That was probably the best part of the meal. I was weary of the goat milk ice cream, but it was DELICIOUS and from a local farm in Glendale.

Definitely try this place out for a special evening, when you can comfortably sit outside and enjoy the superb ambiance. No kiddos please (I say this as a parent, as I think it will be way more fun for them to explore the grounds than sit quietly and eat not so kid friendly food)"

It is one of those tiny little diners, with GREAT food. I am so happy one of my co-workers convinced me to try it out. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. The simplicity of the menu, and the great food it worth the wait though.

Not sure why some of you had such a bad experience... Maybe it's because you went in the summer, I would venture to say that any place that small and that busy would suck in the heat."

Overall, the idea and concept is great. Good food at fair prices. The cocktails and wine are all reasonable. I have had great dishes and bad dishes (chicken and dumplings).

The food to me is 3 stars. I can never get a consistent meal. 3 good meals 2 bad meals, 1 average meal. I know what to order now and what to stay away from. If your looking for outstanding food...this is not for the foodie. It's good comfort food.

That being said! What makes this place stand out is the service and management. They have always gone out of there way to be a step up on every body else. They always greet us and the owner is willing to come by and chat about food, wine, service, or any thing else you want. The service to me is 5 stars.

If you want the best relaxed experience sit at the bar and enjoy the scenery of the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. The bartenders are great and always engaging.

I wish them continued success!"

The patio  (The biggest on Scottsdale road) I think, is totally awesome and inviting. If you are in old town and craving some food, this is the place to stop!"

I took a few bites and i was disgusted how raw the beef was. I don't mean med rare or rare. I mean raw! It was so unappetizing I just threw it in the trash. I can't find one redeeming quality about what I ate. Don't even get me started on the wife's entree and soup! Yuck! However, the egg roll was good! At least it was cooked! What was delivered to me was not even fit for the stray cat in the front yard!  Please... Read this.. I rarely criticize, but this was down right horrible! What a waste of money!"

67zCgILB2h6JoSvFabVe7g,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"Came here Saturday night around 9PM, to our surprise it wasn't too busy. While my friend and I waited to be seated, we were lounging on an amazing incline chair that viewed the amazing Phoenix sky.  My friend and I were seated in less than 10 minutes. We were seated outside which was nice, but it felt like we were in the way of everyone's way, but besides that, the place was nice. Our server was ok, nothing too spectacular, I've had better.

The art was neat as well! This place was a good place to be ""seen"" if you get my drift, but the food was just like everything else. I wouldn't mind coming back here to be ""seen"" and have a couple of cocktails."
rOVuZJfFVDI7rDjzkT-WNA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"This place is soo neat and cozy!
I love coming here before I go to work or during my lunch break. I usually get their Caramel Latté and their Chocolate Homemade Scones. Their scones are delicious and moist, I seriously could eat them all day long!

The people there are really nice, very helpful, and polite. They know how to treat their customers.

I would definitely come back here again!

I like how they keep you in their database so that the 10th drink you order is FREE. Most places make you carry a stamp-card, but this place is a little more techy coz it's all computerized. NEATO!"
Clq09vq8uOjAbGY3BaQWDQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,3,"i'd give this place 3.5 stars

i went here for a birthday dinner for a friend of mine. i thought the place was  neat, customer service was great, the food was delicious, but it was too overpriced.

i think that's what i'm mostly reviewing on is the price of their food. although, it was yummy, i don't know if i'd ever go there again to pay for a $25 plate of korean beef.

i mean, if you guys can afford to fork over some $$$ then be my guess. i think you'll get your moneys worth. the quality was excellent and worth your time to try it."

the food was great and light but yet filling. i didn't feel like i ate a pan of grease after eating here. it was a good quality, healthy breakfast.

the customer service was great!! they were really friendly and helpful with what we needed.

i will definitely come back to this place and enjoy myself a honey cured-ham with apple and brie cheese breakfast. YUMMMY!!!"
bsauQzwixetBDjA7SqUlVA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"I love this place!! Their breakfast is amazing! The location is a little hard to find, but it's worth the search. The interior design is very neat, they have faux finished on their wall, it makes it seem like you're in Tuscany. hahaha or maybe not. I would suggest everyone at least try this place once. It's just a good place to enjoy a great morning breakfast."
yTur95e-pqQCYGGyVp6rAw,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"A new Asian community. I think this is Lee-Lee's competition... pretty much yeah. The plaza setup is really neat. It's like a mini-mall.

The aisles do seem a little small especially when there are other people, but it's way neat to explore. I like the little stores outside of the main grocery stores... I always check out the Asian mobile store. I'm a big fan of NOKIAs so I ways need to check out what kind of selection their store has. I was not disappointed!

Check this place out, it's pretty neat. Never been to any place like it."
apdb7MGnmnx6nGWBJ0ch_g,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,2,"It's my first time here and the only thing I was impressed about what that the establishment is located in an old gas station.

The people working here are not too personable when talking with customers. I understand they might get tired of doing that for 5 hours, but if their friends come in leaning and hanging out on the counter while talking to the employees for half hour or more. Then it's time to get re-train some of these workers to be more customer oriented because they're losing focus. They're talking loud on the phone while on shift - pretty much everyone in the place could hear her business.

The coffee was ""ok"" nothing too special - I like that bitter/sweet taste in my drink, but that wasn't present.

The custom art on the walls are neat and makes the atmosphere of the place more welcoming, but there's a disconnect between that and the worker's attitude. I wouldn't mind coming back to this place and giving them another try... I'll re-review until then."
ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"This place has delightful ambiance. It's very date-friendly. I sat in one of the tables with the RED CHAIR. The proportion was a little odd. The chair was too tall and its arms kept touching the table. It made it was hard to maneuver my arms around it.

Our server was very nice. She seemed to be knowledgeable about their menu, which is very important.

I ordered the Grilled Burrito with the Pork it was delicious!!

I love the chips and the 3 sauces that come with it. very tasty."
Rj3wnYT1QAxpJlRT5mMc-g,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"This place is way neat. It reminds me of a restaurant that I went to in Burlington, Vermont - that very outdoorsey and hippie feel. It's not your local IHOP but it's fancied by the college students around the area... especially after a hang over the night prior. Their greasy potato will cure the most devastating hang over!!

My friend and I would always go here after his long night after the bar. We could go in our pajamas or sweats and no one would really care. Most of the people that go there on a Saturday morning are people who just woke up so don't be haters... we are college students after all.

Every time I go, the service was always really good even though it was a busy Saturday morning.

I would say everyone should try this place at least once and see for yourself."
ibkwcLZwaJ1pnPJVaI_-uA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"this place gets packed during lunch time  hours. the food is great and friendly customer service. I ordered a 3 and to me it seemed like it was a 4 or 5, it was hot but i love spicy food. the server had to keep bring me water to cool me down a notch, my forehead created a puddle on sweat on the floor it was that spicy but sooo good!

you sure can find me back there again.

they do have lunch specials so take advantage of it!!!"
z0NImASe6DNDREiIt8NF-Q,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,4,"i love buffalo wings from this place. i like it extra crispy and light on the sauce, which is perfect!!!

the service is great and quick with the check.

tuesdays are even better because it's wing day!! meaning it's 35cent a wing (i think)"
ohEnmKpF7i2_ujme1p_vUQ,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,3,"Why does this place have a FUNKY smell to it? The first time my friend and I came, it smelled. The second time was no different. I've worked at restaurants before and the smell replicate that of a DIRTY kitchen. Like the floors, rubber mats or the mops haven't been cleaned. The smell of sewage reaps over the entire restaurant. Instead of savoring the pasty aroma as it was being brought out to us from the oven, my friend and I couldn't get over the nasty smell of funk!

The bathroom was also DISGUSTING! I remember being a busboy at a family owned restaurant in Mesa and the staff would always have bathroom duties every hour or so, checking on the bathroom and do general whip-downs and toilet cleaning. It's really a managerial duty to assign tasks like these to the staff.

Moving on to the pasty... well, it was pretty darn good! My friend had the Oogie and I ordered the Greek Chicken. I like the Oogie more... the sauce that accompanied it was delicious, it seemed like it was roux-based; but the second time we went there they gave us a totally different sauce with our Oogie. They had some other sauce with it that tasted like berries. We asked out server if they had another sauce similar to our first visit. We tried explaining what the sauce was like, in terms or color, texture, and goodness, but she came out with a comparable - H.D. (?) sauce. It was ok - not the same though. I was a little disappointed...

Loved the flaky crust, btw.

I really like their food, but aside from the smell it was good! I'll try the Tempe location next time, maybe it'll be less stinky."
fskIA-YRflPnwHWL7Q8bLg,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"I love the food here!!! usually get the Pollo Cubano which is delicious. I also like getting the Plantanes (look at the pictures, it's the one with the fried bananas) the bean dip is out of this world! i usually take my friends here to eat and they all seem to like it. this is also a nice place to take that special someone out on a lovely date. it's relaxing and the valet parking makes it seem like you're a million bucks. hahaha"

I ordered the Veggie Burrito enchilada style with Red Sauce. It was yummy! Also, I did mention to my sister, ""it's a little salty,"" but I didn't mind it. We also ordered the guac and salsa chips. Guac was creamy and exquisite!

I would definitely come back here again!"
AJ8DDFm6QaihAPZI3wFBHw,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,2,"I've been to a few tea places before. This one is nothing special. They have overpriced drinks. The service wasn't that great. It took 8 minutes for them to make our drinks and it was just me and a friend in the entire store!!! We were like ""How long does it take to make iced tea? It's taking quite awhile for them to hand over our drinks! what's the deal!?""

I wouldn't mind coming back here and trying them out again. I mean, the place was really nice, clean and appropriate setting was illustrated with their decor and design. *thumbs up*"
gPTpHByLA8wgZTExRi3v_w,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,3,"Took my dad here to hang out and enjoy what they had to offer since there really isn't any good Filipino restaurants around here.

The place itself was in a ""dead"" location, bad for business if you ask me. It's hidden in a plaza where no one will bother to look. The inside was setup well and the service wasn't bad.

Personally, I can't stand watching the tele while I'm eating. I like eating my meals without the distraction of broadcasters on the tube. It was very loud and annoying.

The food was good, but it was OVERPRICED!! I was surprise at how much the Halo Halo ($5) was.

I liked how they presented the food though. It was very catchy to the eye and it made it separated itself from the typical Filipino restaurants in the valley.

So if you've never been to a Filipino restaurant try this one if you're not a tightwad."
7CzA5GqrELLJyRoaJQhlGA,tTilu3fgu4b0CUBI2F_EXg,5,"I'm probably over doing it, but I've been here 3-days in a row. I'm getting my Mexican fix before heading back to Detroit. It's been a few years since I've been here. I'm never disappointed after eating at this place, the people are friendly, and the juice drinks are sooo good! I can't eat anything like this in the D, not even in Southwest Detroit - Mexicantown.

They have a hotdog stand outside their door for those late night cravings. The guy who mans it is friendly and is there everyday except for Monday nights.

Maybe I'll make tonight my 4th visit and eat some grub! Yummm!!!"
64dfRmMmUsOdLnkBOtzp4w,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Excellent, fresh Mexican cuisine at reasonable prices, especially during happy hour. Their guacamole is chunky, fresh, and original, with pieces of orange in it that add a nice, unexpected citrus sweetness...probably second best in the city to only Barrio Cafe. The chicharron de queso is unique, and the dipping sauce is outrageously good, but be sure to share it with a couple other people unless you can eat a lot of crispy fried cheese cracker yourself. Tacos are all very tasty - the carne asada is a must, marinated so that it's tender, juicy, and slightly sweet. The casual atmosphere and friendly service round this place out as pretty darn good."
QsMR_Fp9YRtDegThsOgFLA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"I had very high hopes for this place, after the very good reviews Fate got and that Sens has been getting, but I was terribly disappointed. The mango papaya spring rolls were dominated by the flavor of anise/licorice. The shu mai dumplings were so hard, even hard-core Italians would have said they were too al dente. The black dragon chicken was good, but not great. After we left, we noticed the dinner menu was much more extensive, especially without the tapas. Maybe dinner here is a much better experience, but I'm not sure I'd even be willing to give it a try after the lunch I had here. As for the atmosphere and decor - don't even get me started. Talk about trying too hard to be hip. The Vegas-y blue lighting in the bar area, the Northwest coffehouse style old-looking couch in the back, the Asian influence...I'm not a proponent of ""matchy-matchy"" decor, but this was all over the place. Service was just okay, too. I won't be back any time soon."
XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, they're all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."
8Zqh2jwtncA3N4fWEMTvZQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"Scramble indeed. Scramble away from this place and into your neighborhood IHOP or Village Inn...at least you'll pay less for equally dismal food. I expected so much more from a new neighborhood place, especially one that's gotten some good reviews and publicity. First of all, I like the system of ordering at the counter for casual lunch and dinner places, but there's something about breakfast that it's ill-suited for. Breakfast is just a full service kind of meal, at least to me. The decor/design is certainly nice and modern, but I wish the food matched. With the exception of their ""brizzas"" (breakfast pizzas), their menu items are the kinds of basic things you'd find at any chain (actually, there's less selection than many chains). We tried the pancakes (we asked for 2 buttermilk and one multigrain) with carmelized bananas. They brought out the pancakes first and then said the bananas would just be a couple minutes. When they finally brought it out, it was one banana halved and carmelized, for three large pancakes - terrible presentation. The pancakes themselves were no better than IHOP. The eggs benedict was equally disappointing - they were served in an ocean of hollandaise sauce, the ham was a tad too salty, and the english muffins were soggy. Originally, I thought of trying one of the ""brizzas"" since they're unique to this place, but I'm glad I didn't. The woman next to me was eating one - it was basically eggs and cheese on a raw-looking flat dough. She didn't appear to be enjoying it at all, picking the eggs off and leaving the dough. I guess I'll be sticking to The Breakfast Club when I do breakfast out."
UBQRhqRMW4Sk7kSZvZ1iAQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Macaron fans in the Valley don't have many options, but all you really need is one great place, and fortunately we have Essence Bakery. I can't say they make the perfect macaron--a little too heavy on the filling and not as thick and pillowy on the meringue part, for my liking--but they're a knockout nonetheless. They're reasonably priced for their size and come in a variety of flavors...the caramel is especially fantastic!"
is2RonWgyENNKOprcXQK6w,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"I'd give the food at Osha a 3.5, but the service was so friendly that I rounded them up..it's a nice, family-run neighborhood, authentic Thai restaurant. It has no atmosphere, as is the case with most Thai places, and the place was empty on the night we went, but they put out some very good food. However, I think the food at Thai House, at Frank Lloyd Wright and Hayden, is just as good and about $1 to $2 less per dish, so combined with their closer location to me, I don't see much reason to go back to Osha over Thai House."
xQtCOQIwrGIiDeHWVHdkBw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"After so much initial Yelp praise, I decided to drop into Nourish to give it a shot. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan or glucose or lactose free, but I am a pretty healthy eater and enjoy delicious food that also happens to be good for you. Nourish seemed like it fit a great need for its niche -- the only similar place I can think of is True Food -- but it fell flat. For starters, it's a good thing they have flavored waters, because their regular water tasted funky. Salads are very tasty but super small - appetizer portions at entree prices. Sandwiches are a much better value, but you can find better at many other places. The sweet potato fries aren't bad, for being ""air fried."" Without that caveat, head-to-head against real fries, not so much (and, come on, isn't ordering sweet potato fries over regular ones already being good enough?!). I will say that the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is delicious! The setting is very casual and comfortable, and the service was great, but it's the food that brings someone back for a second time...and I can't say I plan on returning."
fI9ErCUGY8rXRPBbatcxMA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"I give Posh two stars because obviously the food matters more than anything else at a restaurant, but I commend them for their terrific service and give them the benefit of the doubt that the night we visited was an off night.

For starters, when we made the reservation the night before, we were told we couldn't be accommodated at 7:30, but they could get us in at 8, or maybe a few minutes earlier. We showed up around 7:40 and in this huge restaurant with seating for probably 100, there were maybe 20-25 people. If they couldn't get us in at 7:30, at merely 25% capacity, because ""they couldn't provide the best dining experience possible,"" as they claimed, then I can't imagine how they could ever handle a full restaurant. Regardless, we were seated right away and chose seats at the kitchen bar, to be able to watch the chefs in action. Our server came over and explained the restaurant concept to us and how ordering worked. I won't explain, since many others have already, but we both chose the 4-course chef's choice.

I won't run through all the dishes but, in brief, all of their food with the exception of one fish course and one dessert lacked flavor. Everything from the amuse straight through to the end was so one-dimensional...the flavor profile was so narrow...absolutely no depth of flavor.

After our first course, the manager came over and asked how everything was. We were honest about how bland everything was, and he said, ""Let us try this course again for you."" They did, and when he returned to see if this was better, we said yes because, at this point, we felt bad complaining about the food any further...but it wasn't.

We were very disappointed with our meal, especially after Seftel's glowing review and the great Yelp reviews. We spent much time speaking with the manager, who seemed to care genuinely about our feedback, rather than just indulging us in listening to our opinion. Posh is lucky to have such a great manager. He explained that he wasn't making excuses but that, due to the nature of their concept, they do have off nights where they look back the following day and say, ""That menu didn't really work."" He also explained that they don't follow a minimalist or ""blandness"" credo, per se, but that the chef doesn't want to throw out anything that will scare the diners, since people won't think to put ""No sea urchin"" on their card when they order. I understand this, but I think people who come to this type of place are fairly adventurous diners to begin with. Not only that, but you don't have to be too wild to give flavor. A little seasoning on the lamb and duck, a nice port wine reduction or orange glaze...give me SOMETHING to excite my palate!

They ended up taking 10% off our bill and I think they gave us a little bigger dessert, thoughtful gestures that further conveyed their commitment to customer satisfaction.

As we were leaving, the manager said, ""You know, with prices like ours, we can't really afford to have off nights or people won't come back and we'll be here two or three more months. But I really hope you'll come back and give us another chance."" Because he was so nice and because I really want this place to survive and do well, I'd love to give them a second shot. I just don't know if I can justify another $100 meal with the risk of it being off the mark when I can be assured of a stunning meal at Noca or other foodie destinations for the same cost.

I thank Posh for their excellent service, but if the food continues to let diners down, making it right with great service will be no substitute for not disappointing in the first place."
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"This place is bomb. Fantastic, flavorful, juicy burgers but my favorite thing is their fries. They do regular and sweet potato fries (brought out in little shopping carts) and both are amazing - skinny, crispy, not at all greasy - they come with ketchup and another awesome dipping sauce. I've also had the fish sandwich and a salad here, and they were just as high quality and wonderful as their burgers and fries. Shakes are good here, too. They have a very small space, so expect to wait unless you want to sit at the communal table or outside (in which case you still might wait). However, it's a very nice atmosphere, with casual vibe and good music. I only deduct a point because service was so-so on my last visit, and the restaurant smelled like a nursing home for some reason."
Tl2nqtPXlLbAG3qkUYVM2g,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"While I didn't get the authentic Vincent Southwestern French experience (they offer a limited menu in summer...the waiter explained that their regular menu is too wintery and heavy for the summer season), I am still glad I finally made it to this Valley fine dining establishment. We opted for their special ""Julia & Julia"" $35 3-course prix fixe menu, a great value at a restaurant where entrees alone typically run $35. All but one of the dishes were Julia Child recipes, while the one that wasn't was a dish Chef Vincent cooked for Julia Child many years ago. The dishes were very classic French fare, and all were exceptional. And their croissants...oh my! I could've eaten 10 of them! The service at Vincent's is professional and friendly, if not always the most prompt, while the dining room is Old World elegant (think French Cottage dishes and a player piano). If you've never tried Vincent's or haven't been in a while, I highly recommend taking advantage of this great deal while you can (this August only!)."
ndQTAJzhhkrl1i5ToEGSZw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"In general, I do like Oregano's, and would give the chain as a whole 3.5 stars. However, the one time I tried this location, the service was pretty bad, it took forever for our food to come (when the place wasn't even that crowded), and when things came out wrong, neither our server nor the manager were very apologetic...in fact, they could have cared less. The Oregano's Favorite salad was delicious, as usual. The pizzas were just okay. I like the Scottsdale locations much better."
nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"As somewhat of a Valley foodie, I've been lucky enough to try some of the best restaurants in the city but have surprisingly never gotten around to trying one of the Valley's classic fine dining destinations, Christopher's. So after a day of work, I decided to try their happy hour, which had gotten a great review from the Republic. Christopher's new space in the Biltmore is nicely designed - clean and modern, with Edison lightbulbs and a warm brown and orange color scheme. The service is great, too. But the food is what matters, and I don't think it stacks up to some of the finest restaurants in the Valley. Here's what I think the problem is - Christopher's opened at a time when the Valley was anything but a foodie town, and classic or contemporary French was out of the question, so he designed a dumbed-down French menu, with more American sensibilities. And since that formula worked, he hasn't changed it. But in the meantime, bolder and more daringly gourmet restaurants have settled in the Valley. Now, Christopher's menu seems tame compared to places like Noca and Binkley's. Back to our happy hour meal - we started out with roasted red pepper soup, ($3.50) which was delicious. Next we had the tomato pizza ($6 I believe) - the crust was excellent, light and doughy, but the pizza as a whole lacked flavor. Rarely do I say pizza isn't salty enough, but this one did. Salmon ($8) was a good deal, but the fish quality was not as great as I'd expect from a place like this. The lemon butter sauce was nice and light, but I've had better elsewhere. Dessert ($9) was darn good - tarte tatin, a warm apple tart with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Overall, Christopher's is solidly good, but it's been eclipsed by a new generation of superb Valley restaurants geared to our new foodie scene."
Sy75QB18Sv-xNp8FoA8KvQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Go Go now to happy hour at Geisha A Go Go! HALF PRICE for house rolls, appetizers, and drinks that are already fairly priced! The setting is hip but relaxed and the service is great (guys, and some girls, will want to enthusiastically thank the HR department). It's not the finest sushi in town, and the menu is ""American Japanese"" but they'll tell you themselves that's exactly what they're going for."
ALn_0f-Usn3n0a9WBcjhhg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"HUGE space on 1st St., with nice decor, although a little too drab for my tastes. And the music is offbeat...a little classical, a little New Age, a little jazz. The bathrooms are super weird, as you'd expect from the people behind AZ88. The service is very friendly, if not always the most prompt. The food is...well, it's nothing memorable. Their ""bruschetta"" is really more like an olive tapenade, with crostini on the side. When I asked a friend how he liked Hanny's, he said, ""It's good, but a little oily."" I thought, ""what?!"" but I understood what he meant when I saw and tasted the crostini. And then came the prosciutto pizza. While I loved the thin crust, the nice sauce, the prosciutto, arugala, and fresh shaved parmigiano-reggiano, the cheese was also super oily. Bring the Tums, people. Dessert was the biggest flop of all. The lemon meringue tart had almost no lemon at all. It was basically warm, runny meringue (which the waitress said had just been freshly made...obviously not well) on a crust. It was like it was missing a whole layer of lemon filling. Hanny's will be a cool place to hang out and grab a drink after Suns or D-backs games, but it's not a place to go to for the food."
PzsrU41s4-QCUdb7lua2GQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"We checked out Primebar for the Phoenix Magazine Grand Opening event and I left with mixed feelings. I will say that they put on a nice event, with a free open bar (woo hoo!) and plenty of food, all tasty but nothing exceptional. Also, the service was outstanding...we didn't even have to go to one of the three bars for our second round of drinks, as a server came by to ask what we were having and promptly returned with them. My big problem is with the design...bland, boring, and corporate (which it is). The whole place is done in neutrals, with wood-like walls, a few Edison bulbs with metal mesh around them to pass as light fixtures, some mosaic tiling (still in neutrals), large neutral-toned pictures, flat screen TVs all over, and a mix of modern alternative and rock music. It's certainly not the sleek and sophisticated bar I imagined when they compared themselves to places like Blue Martini, Sapporo, and Ocean Club...it's more like a Yard House than any of those places. Great for watching the big game but not as a sophisticated watering hole."
F2F6rJ_SPo-lUhJ_AmufLA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Yum, yum, yum!  The banana chocolate cupcakes are fantastic, as are the apple and MJ cookies.  I also had a cobbler that was very impressive.  What an asset to that area!  The non-sweets are just okay, but why come to a place called Tammie Coe Cakes for a meal?!  It's all about the sweets!"
M3UBFrd_W8JVChCxpUDY4Q,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"I loooves my salads, so I had to try Tossed, the new-ish create-your-own salad place in the area. I actually ended up going with one of their menu salads, because it's less expensive, as the girl at the counter pointed out. If you make your own, it's $7 for the lettuce, 4 toppings, and dressing. Each additional topping is $.50, cheeses are $1, and proteins are $2. The Tossed Signature salad I ordered for $9 would have cost $10.50 had I made it on my own. So if you make your own salad, the prices can get a little steep, but their menu salads are very reasonable, IMO. Reviewers complaining about $8-9 salads...where else can you go get a freshly made lunch for much less than that in North Scottsdale?!  The salad prices are comparable to Paradise Bakery and other similar quick-serve options. And the portions are comparable to CPK or Cheesecake Factory, where you'd pay $11-14 for a salad with a protein in it. This is a great place for a quick and healthy lunch!"
PpnHlk95jbeK261RHuXflw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"It's nice to see McGrath back in the kitchen whipping up his terrific Southwestern food. They did a nice job converting the space that formerly housed South Beach, with a large bar area and nice dining room area. The service, for only being open a short while, was wonderful - we sat in the bar area and had multiple servers checking in on us regularly. They have happy hour in the bar area from 4-7 nightly, and there are even tables and booths, so you might as well sit there if it's during those hours. Happy hour drink prices are good but not a steal - $5 well drinks, margaritas, and wine, $3 bottles of beer. The crabmeat and cabbage ""enchiladas"" (regular menu) were a tasty, light appetizer. For entrees, we had Bob's Big Burger and the chicken flatbread off the happy hour menu. The burger was a bit overcooked but the thin fries were great. They don't discount the burger for happy hour, so you're probably better off getting Roaring Fork's Big-Ass Burger during happy hour. The flatbread was great and a great value - $8 on happy hour for a pretty sizable portion (8 slices). The beet cake dessert with carrot gelato was definitely unique and surprisingly good. It's not an everyday kind of place, but hopefully McGrath will find success here as a destination restaurant much like Roaring Fork was when he was there."
-YR7K3rw6VAQ1-MjslvsoQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Just stopped in for a quick lunch and decided to go for a Bento box.  It's quite a good deal.  For $8.95, you get miso soup, sunomono, salad with ginger dressing, katsu chicken, terriyaki chicken with rice, and a piece of salmon (there are other combinations to choose from, as well).  They also have other inexpensive lunch specials and terrific happy hour deals from 4:00-6:30 and 8:30-close.  While it won't have me running back when I'm craving good Japanese, it's a perfectly good place for a quick, inexpensive meal when in that area."
Ade8mPSOeEw2OodsN9DadA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"As many good things as I had heard about Bourbon Steak, I couldn't bring myself to try it when their prices make even Mastro's look reasonable. However, during the summer, they run a special $39 3-course Summer Menu that is a terrific value. They don't offer it automatically, though, so be sure to request it.

The restaurant is situated in the beautiful Fairmont Princess - valet is complimentary. The space is the steakhouse modernized - dark tones, warm lighting, top-40 and rock music. The service is terrific, from the hostess to the server to the GM. And the food is Michael Mina great. For a chef who has developed quite a large collection of restaurants across the country, his places never disappoint.

Bourbon Steak begins your meal with a trio of duckfat fries, ""compliments of the chef."" This is the Holy Trinity of fries...true perfection, and far better a start to a meal than any bread could be, although they also brought us black truffle potato bread that was excellent. I can't speak to any of the dishes on the regular menu, but if you decide to try the Summer Menu, I highly recommend the date and mozzarella appetizer. We also had the calamari app, but it was a little disappointing - the jalapeño poppers it's served with were delicious, and the dipping sauce was great, but the calamari batter was a bit soggy. For entrees, both the short rib and the skirt steak were terrific - tender and flavorful, with not a bit of fat. I'd say the short rib was the slight favorite of the two. And I can only imagine how crazy good the chicken mac 'n' cheese is, but it seemed a little too indulgent for such a big meal. Finally, both of the desserts - the passion fruit panna cotta and the Greek yogurt parfait - were fantastic. The perfect light and refreshing ending to the meal. If you're only getting one, it just depends on whether you like something a little more tart (the panna cotta) or sweeter (the parfait).

I'm thrilled they have this summer deal to allow diners who might otherwise be frightened off by the prices to give them a try. While I probably won't be back anytime soon without a corporate expense account, I'd say Bourbon Steak should be up there with Mastro's and J&G (which, of the three, is the best value, IMO) as the Valley's finest steakhouses."
AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"If ever a Phoenix area restaurant were deserving of 6 stars, this is it. Kai is one of the most exceptional dining experiences you'll ever have. It starts with complimentary valet, then walking into the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort's beautiful lobby, with murals on the ceiling and a large fountain representing the Gila River, and finally to the hostess desk, where you're greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. The dining room at Kai is casually elegant and boasts beautiful views - be sure to go before sunset. You'll also notice the lovely paintings by a Native artist, which also decorate the front of the menus. But what really sets Kai apart from the rest of the wonderful foodie destinations in the city is the extraordinary service. From the choice of four accompaniments for your water at the beginning of your night to having your car ready for you out front with two bottles of Voss, chocolates, and a personal hand-written thank you note from the server at the end of the night, you will feel pampered like royalty.

The food at Kai truly is unique and exceptional, focusing on local ingredients whenever possible and blending Native cuisine with French, Spanish, Mexican, and other diverse influences. Few people seemed aware of this, and they don't promote it at the restaurant, but they currently offer a $59 ""Kai Cares"" menu where you get three courses of their most popular dishes - hand picked lettuces app, grilled buffalo tenderloin entree, and traditional fry bread dessert. These items would normally cost you $74, so it's quite a good deal. We did one of these meals and also did the lobster degustation app and the grouper entree. Everything was spectacular, perfectly cooked, and bursting with amazing flavors. I was a little worried buffalo would be a rougher meat, but it was tender like a filet mignon. In addition, we received an amuse, a sorbet intermezzo, and chocolate truffles after dessert, which are such elegant touches that really enhance the experience. And the breads, made in house and served with their own brand of olive oil, were fantastic.

Kai is very deserving of its Mobil 5 Star and AAA 5 Diamond ratings, and is tied with Binkley's for Arizona's best restaurant, IMO. It is an experience not to be missed for Valley foodies, special occasion splurges, or visitors wanting a unique taste of Arizona's Native cuisine."
2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Los Reyes has gotten such rave reviews, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I thought that the Torta Los Reyes, their signature torta, was just a glorified Denny's Grand Slamwich with hot sauce. I didn't find the meat that flavorful, nor the sauces. That said, the restaurant is surprisingly nice inside, the service is prompt and friendly, and the mango agua fresca was amazing. Maybe I'm just not the torta type, because for the most part, I'm a healthy eater and avoid beef, pork, and ham. My dad, on the other hand, loved the torta."

This is not your traditional Mediterranean place - they focus non offering healthy items at very reasonable prices. They have many of the staples of Greek/Mediterranean food, like gyros, chicken shawarma, hummus, etc., but lack some of the less healthy dishes (like saganaki). What they lack in traditional Mediterranean dishes they make up for with other healthy offerings, like Caribbean salad, veggie burgers, pizzas, etc. Whether you eat in their nice modern dining room or take it to go, you'll enjoy the food, and your body and wallet will thank you."
U7fZfH9C4hj5BFRYaPOo2w,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Went to Prado for a birthday celebration and things started off very well - it's a beautiful dining room, and the live guitar music is a nice addition. The hostess and maitre d' were both friendly and personable. They pour you a glass of sherry on the way to sit down at the table, a lovely touch of authentic Spain. All good so far. However, the food is very hit or miss, as others have suggested. Some dishes really shined (butternut squash soup, bison short rib, pineapple coconut cake) while others really disappointed (one-dimensional gazpacho, chewy calamari, fish overpowered by olive tapenade). My advice: soak in the atmosphere and music at the bar, maybe snack on some tapas, but skip the restaurant unless you're okay with hit-and-miss. Such a shame, too, because I LOVED Chef Urciuoli's cuisine when he was at Taggia."

Where else could I get great Thai in a short drive? Luckily, I saw the Yelp praise for Thai House and tried it for lunch today. This place is authentic and delicious! The pad thai and panang chicken were both stellar! The full verdict will be in once I try their Tom Kha soup, but it was too hot for that on an AZ summer day. The service is quick and the atmosphere is nice (very light and contemporary for a Thai place). Thank you, Thai House...you are my new go-to!"
R1k-z3Mauqk4v-7ZeEVsHQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"This was my first venture into Salvadoran cuisine, and what a great place to be exposed to it. This place is so authentic, they barely speak any English. Luckily, I was able to use my decent (although far from fluent) Spanish to ask what things were and get the waitress's recommendations. We had the plato tradicional appetizer, a platter of Salvadoran specialties - for $9, you get two pupusas (of your choice), two beef empenada-like things, three fried yucca things, and a chicken tamale. If you want a nice exposure to different Salvadoran dishes, I highly recommend this as a meal for one or a starter for two or three. The pupusas, especially, were fantastic. Next, we had some chicken dish with onions in a gravy-like sauce--also delicious--that came with a side of rice and beans (and a ""salad"" that was just some iceberg and tomato with a wedge of lime). The refried beans were some of the best I've had. And this whole dish cost $9, if I remember correctly. I highly recommend Guanaquito to expose yourself to the authentic cuisine of El Salvador. The price is right, the service is friendly, and the food is delicious!"
SN5r_mlySBoAGVzXD6K0qA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Amarone has wonderful service and a nice, upscale dining room, but it is quite overpriced for what you get.  The best part of the meal was great flatbread they brought out to start, with a delicious eggplant/onion/caper/etc. mix to go with it.  Once you're actually paying for the food, your expectations probably won't be met.  The caprese should definitely be avoided - for $10, you get the cheap, hard mozzarella usually used in pizzas.  It's the most expensive and worst caprese I've ever had, and I eat A LOT of caprese.  I've never had a restaurant use the cheap, hard mozzarella in caprese, no matter what the price.  For $10, they should give you the good buffalo mozz (or better yet, the soft, creamy mozz) and some hearty beefsteak tomatoes would have been nice.  However, our farfalle pasta with asparagus and smoked chicken in a cream sauce was yummy.  Again, a little pricey at $17 for just noodles, chicken, and asparagus, three fairly cheap ingredients.  I don't mind paying for upscale Italian, but it should be innovative food with high quality ingredients, not neighborhood Italian food that's $2-3 more per dish than everywhere else.  Amarone, here's a tip - ditch the loud singer/guitar player and charge us a little less for your dishes...oh, and you better start using the good mozz, because I've had grocery store caprese better than yours for half the price!"
TsguKRepJOvT-w8aI1XLTA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"If you like ""make your own"" salads with a huge variety of fresh toss-ins and flavorful dressings, then Market Bistro is your place. The salads ($7.99) can get a wee bit pricey when you start adding in proteins ($2.29), but they're very big...enough for your entire meal, or even to share as a light meal. I've also tasted their tortilla soup, and it's wonderful, and I know others who enjoy their sandwiches."
xsFeeqZS6PoVvwseEefzEw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"I can see why the two most common ratings for PastaBAR are 2 stars or 5 stars. It's very hit-or-miss...some dishes are spectacular and others are just mediocre. We started out with the fritto misto, some fried cheese and a variety of lightly fried vegetables. If only they were as lightly seasoned as they were fried, this would have been a great appetizer, but they were pretty over-salted. When the person brought it out, we asked if it came with any dipping sauce, to which she replied simply, ""No."" I guess that answered the question, but it would have been nice if she said, ""Not normally, but would you like some?"" Of our two pastas, one was okay and one was a knockout. The fetuccini dish with pesto, raisins, pine nuts, etc. was pretty bland. On the other hand, the orecchiette dish with sausage and greens was bursting with flavor. One thing I'll say about both dishes is that the pasta itself was perfectly cooked and tasted as homemade and wonderful as you'd expect at a place called PastaBAR...Wade Moises certainly has the Italian cuisine credentials and knows his pasta. And as for those who say the portions are too small, I say your stomachs are too big. It's one thing to note that the dishes are one the high end of the price spectrum, which they are, especially for lunch, but the portions are perfectly satisfactory. This is no Olive Garden - no endless pasta bowls here. We were both busting after our one appetizer and two pastas, and my one pasta alone could have filled me up. Of course, even though we were busting, we decided to try the light, refreshing peach/orange granita for dessert. Our server kindly brought out the cappuccino one, too, explaining, ""I brought the cappuccino granita, as well, because I think it's really the star of our granitas."" Man, was she right! While the peach/orange granita was refreshing, it was a little too tart and lacked the depth and richness of flavor that the cappuccino one had. So you can see that some dishes hover in mediocrity while others rise to perfection. Order carefully, as it will make or break your meal. I'd give the food 3.5 stars, taking into account both the mediocre and excellent dishes, but PastaBAR gets a 4 overall taking into account the friendly service and casually hip space."
K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Razz has been around in the Valley since before I was born, but it was one of those places that I never had gotten around to trying until recently. I can see why he's been a mainstay of the city's dining scene for so long - his food is terrific, the atmosphere is pleasantly casual, the service is good (although not as ""refined"" as you might expect for that price point), and the prices are fair...not to mention that he's a great people person, working from his open kitchen, chatting with diners, and going around to greet his customers at their tables. Menu items change periodically, but the duck cake appetizer is a mainstay, and for good reason - it's a dish he's been making his whole career, and it's delicious! Is Razz's the standout it was before the likes of Binkley's and Noca opened? It's not, but his fans like it that way, as do the critics of the Republic, apparently, who named it the ""Best Kept Secret."""

Like last year's winner from the Republic's Critic Choice Best New Restaurant, Noca, this year's winner, FnB, is a recession era ""fine dining"" restaurant...classy but casual atmosphere; intimate service; and locally-sourced, high quality ingredients prepared simply and perfectly! I recommend sitting at the counter and watching the magic happen in the kitchen. The almost-completely Arizona wine list is a unique trait, and the Cabezas Meskeoli white blend was very nice. That said, they are a bit pricey (they probably come from small wineries not benefitting from economies of scale). The food menu changes often, so I won't comment on specific dishes, but I don't really think you can go wrong here...appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all superb! Food prices are reasonable for ""fine dining""...not an everyday place, but it doesn't have to be relegated to once a year special occasions, either. And if you're a late night person, the special meals served after 10PM on Fridays and Saturdays make FnB even more affordable. I'd give FnB 4.5 overall."

I had heard that during the day there is a butcher shop inside, and while we sat & talked I took a peek at that menu. I am planning on heading over this weekend to pick up some steaks to grill at home - it all looked delicious.

We all split a bottle of Pinot Noir, and ordered a bunch of items to share. The guac appetizer is delish, and we shared the mushroom quesadilla which surprised me with how good it was. I'm normally not a fan of quesadillas, so I'm always happy to be proven wrong.

We ordered the pork sandwich (I don't remember the name) and HOLY CRAP it was incredible! I had a hard time sharing and felt guilty that the hubs wasn't there to try it.

We'll definitely be back. Loved all the food and the friendly atmosphere."
PzsrU41s4-QCUdb7lua2GQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,1,"I would love to be able to review the food / drinks for this 'Hot' Spot, however I can't!

I called around 1pm on a Friday to reserve a table that night for a friend's birthday celebration. I reserved a table for 10 people at 10pm; and told the host that answered the phone I would call back around 8:30 to let them know if the number of guests would be significantly less than 10 (he had said it is hard to hold a spot for 10 people that late... I thought I was being helpful by offering to do so...)

I called that night around 8:50pm (20 minutes late, I know....) to let them know it would only be 8 people, not 10. I was told by a different hostess that answered the phone that my reservation was at 8:30, and I had missed it. I explained to the hostess there must be a mistake, and that my reservation was at 10pm, not 8:30. She said that NO, my reservation was at 8:30, and the table was gone, and there really wasn't anything that I could do. I asked to speak to a manager, as now we would be scrambling to find a new spot, should the reservation not go through. (**Note, you do not need a table to go to Primebar, however it was the birthday girl wanted, so I wanted to make that happen.)

The manager, Sean, got on the phone, and told me that I had missed my reservation, and that they had called me two times to see if we'd be coming, but I never answered. Now, seeing as that my phone hadn't rung at all that night, I asked Sean if he had me confused with someone else. (Hey, mix-ups happen!)

Sean then told me that he is sure they had called me, yet wouldn't confirm the number dialed, and continued to speak over me and not answer my questions about if there was anything we could do to get a table set aside for us. Due to his 'jerkiness' I said he was being a real Jacka$$, as I was trying bring him business. He then got REALLY mad, and said ""Listen, Deary, this is how this is going to work"" and ""This is what we are going to do"" and other ridiculous comments (during this time, I wasn't getting a word in edgewise, he just kept repeating how I messed up and that we couldn't have a table, etc etc). It was really shocking how nasty and vile his attitude was. He wasn't interested in all in problem solving, but rather a power-trip and scolding me was all he focused on.

I then was forwarded to speak to his General Manager, Matt, who was nicer, but didn't apologize for the mix-up or for Sean's ridiculous behavior. He offered to buy a round of drinks for us, should we go there at a later date.. but I politely declined. I am shocked and appalled at what Primebar considers to be 'customer service'.

To the management's credit, I did speak to the Marketing Director of the Scottsdale Quarter today, and she was very nice and apologetic; however she doesn't run the day-to-day operations of Primebar.

Based on the other reviews it looks like the food is pretty good - but I can say that the management team they have in there is horrible... which can't bode well for the rest of the staff."
AMN3Sgns9tB2x-b3eWk0qQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Stopped in with a friend for lunch - and to be honest I never even noticed this spot. It's located near Lo-Lo's, which is where my attention always seemed to be drawn. (Who would have thought?)

They have great lunch specials, so I opted for that. The cashew chicken stirfry was AWESOME. Everything was cooked and season just perfectly. Even better, it came with a cup of soup and a potsticker. I love bonus goodies!

Will definitely be back - so many other fun menu items to try."
6ySrrRnMB_vb1oTroNFD4A,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"The hubs & I LOVE the Village Coffee Roastery. We typically ride our bikes up the greenbelt on the weekends to grab a coffee and a bite for breakfast.

The place is BUSY on weekends, but the food was served quickly, and hot. Here is a recap of this past weekend's visit:

The hub's mocha was good - better than he usually gets from Starbucks. I had a large coffee, which  I take black, and this coffee was strong, but smooth.

For breakfast we ordered a breakfast burrito w/ sausage, and a croissant sandwich with ham. Both were DELICIOUS, and the portion sizes are larger than we expected, but the quality is what we had come to expect.

It's a great little spot, locally owned, and full of friendly people. Very much worth the ride to get here :)."
5L4XcFz1YKeurNGeMR-fsQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Oh Randy's! I have lived next to you for the past two years, and am kicking myself for not stopping in sooner.

Living in Old Town, we are lucky to be surrounded by many local, unique places for a bite to eat. Normally on a weekend morning we'd venture to The Good Egg, the Breakfast Club or the Pancake House. A few months back we decided to stop by Randy's, and we are SO happy we did.

First, it is a no frills type of place. Lots of seating, the food comes out quick, the menu is basic, and it's a cash only place. Everyone that works there is busy, but friendly. The food is good, basic and filling. The prices are fantastic for the value you get. We typically come for breakfast, but this past weekend we enjoyed a delicious late lunch, and even stopped by later that evening on a bike ride for a scoop of ice cream.

I love going to Randy's, I like the food, like the people, like how normal it is. Two thumbs up :)."
k1c_bC3DK6mKg797vH1T8w,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"What a fun spot! Came here on a Wed night out of the blue with the hubs & some friends. I have been wanting to stop in for quite a while, and I was glad to have the opportunity.

We were sat promptly, and water was on the table quickly. The menu was SO interesting to read, and immediately I found four or five items that sounded delicious. Being pregnant, I stuck with water, but the rest of the people at our table enjoyed some great beers of draft - they were happy with the selection.

For dinner I ordered the Vegetable Chop salad & a side of the bacon cheddar biscuits. ( How could you NOT order something that fabulous?) Hubs ordered the Pork Osso Buco Confit (and yes, I did have to go to Beckett's website to get that name, no way I was remembering that on my own.) Two others at our table ordered the Cast Iron Chicken & Chicken Meatballs.

Before we knew it, our orders were at the table. They LOOKED delicious, and from the first bite we weren't disappointed. The pork my husband ordered was nothing short of incredible, and my salad was the perfect size & well proportioned (I hate when you are overloaded with too much lettuce and not enough veggies.) Our table mates devoured their meals - not giving us a bite, which was understandable.

For dessert we ordered a Peanut Butter Smores milkshake. Oh my richness-heavenly-milkshakeland. That milkshake definitely brings the boys to the yard. Oh, and it came with a chocolate covered strip of bacon. Are you kidding me? Awesome.

Can't wait to go back!"
7pGWy3mR7gjMSE6x2njqPA,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"This is definitely a place to check out if you are in downtown Scottsdale in the morning / afternoon.

The service is slow, but that doesn't equal bad. The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection. When you are trying to enjoy an afternoon and aren't rushed to eat and move on to the next activity on your plate, you have to check out Orange Table!"
WSdANzoNmwLPAVuVw5SOFw,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"I have to preface this by saying that I am a fan of Nimbus beer, and I have heard nothing but great things of the Nimbus in Tucson. We stopped by the other night with the in-laws and my dad for a bite.

First, the staff was VERY friendly, and we were seated promptly. Everyone at the table ordered a beer (except me, preggo lady.) I did look at the menu to see if they had anything non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic to order, and sadly they didn't. I know O'douls is boring, but would have been fun to see that on the menu. Anywho...

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an app - it came out quickly and it was SO good. We gobbled that up.

For dinner I ordered the patty melt, and the hubs ordered a burger that was served open-face on two pieces of texas toast, smothered in cheese & french fries. It was every man's unhealthy wet dream.

The portions were large, and the food was great! The only complaint we have is that the music was too loud. I'm a person that can appreciate music in a bar / restaurant, but the music was so loud that we could barely hear each other at the table.

We'll go back, but probably try to sit closer together or outside to avoid the music, should it still be so loud."
mm0qwYzOilFNVV2us5_8Rg,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Have happened upon this place a few times while on bike rides with friends. Always enjoy the atmosphere, the staff and the DELICIOUS food. Was excited to find a local coffee shop;  as we are always looking for alternatives.

Would suggest for a great date night, a place to stop for a quick cup, or a relaxing night of conversation."
iJi7yebXoPVXRyGqqL-v8g,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"This is one of our favorite places to go for dinner, late night drinks, a few glasses of wine during the day or a relaxing place to listen to live music.

Their french fries are delicious & my fiance had the prime rib and said it was better than mine! (and mine is DELICIOUS, let me tell you! ;))"
Iq7NqQD-sESu3vr9iEGuTA,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"You know that any place named 'Butters' is gonna be good.

There can be a long wait on weekends,but it is SO worth it. The menu is what you would expect, but the serving sizes are generous, the food comes quick and everything is delicious.

The fried egg sandwich is a family favorite, as are the blueberry pancakes (gluten free!) and the wildberry crepes were mouth watering. Worth the wait, and lives up to it's delicious name :)."
6tLL1P8k9drb7MJEVwmRhg,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"The headache the next morning is worth it...

Went to Papago for the first time for a friend's birthday happy hour. I never would have thought you could find such a fun brewery in a strip mall.
I'll be the first to admit I'm not a great beer drinker - I am the type to stick with a Miller Lite or whatever everyone else is drinking. At Papago, their selection is incredible. It's just big enough that you realize that you should order something 'fun', but not so large that you are overwhelmed and give up and just guess at what to order.

The staff is really knowledgeable, patient and are really attentive. The Orange Blossom is crazy delicious, and they have a coffee stout beer that caught me by surprise - in a good way.

The food is great - the menu consists of great apps, pizza, sandwiches, and the salads are fantastic. Great for an afternoon, Happy Hour or dinner. You gotta try it!"
_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"Rokjeri is the type of place you go when you want a good meal, great atmosphere and feel like you are in a different place in the world.

The food is incredible. My husband tried their porterhouse steak with an incredible holindase (spelling error, I know) sauce. When I tried a bite, it was the first time I ever understood how a steak can melt in your mouth. Like butter. Ugh, just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

The upstairs is dark, sexy, open and smells delicious. The downstairs has a few tables, few booths, a huge fireplace and a bar. You can't go wrong sitting either place.

You should probably make reservations if you plan on stopping by, as it's always busy!"
fjvu3PkvrTOoIjNqL1vrJQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"We kept driving by The Spotted Donkey and one Friday night we finally decided to stop by and see what it was about.

We sat on the patio, which was great. We were right by the fireplace, and it was romantic and intimate. We ordered chips and salsa as an app (they are not just given as you wait, like other Mexican restaurants.) The chips were delicious, and were served with three different salsas. They were DELICIOUS! One of them was a mango salsa, but man did it have KICK. Though I couldn't handle the heat, I kept going back for more because the flavor was incredible.

For dinner the hubs ordered the green chile mac n cheese, and I ordered the tacos - chicken & steak. All were incredible, and delicious.

After dinner we decided to sit at the bar for a few more drinks, and we ordered their fried ice cream dessert. Yummm, it was a perfect way to end the meal.

The staff was friendly, courteous and we loved the vibe of the place. We will definitely be back!"
8ciT6qjI18x9EPtOb-gqYQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Oh this place is so good.

Finally made the Hubs take me during Yelp week - and he too is glad I forced the issue.

At first, I wasn't totally sold on the ambiance of the place, but as the night continued (and the wine flowed) I found myself more and more happy.

We ordered the baked brie & onion tarte as appetizers. DELICIOUS. Ugh, just writing about them makes me want to go back and get more...

The hubs ordered the filet, and I ordered the salmon. Both were perfection. The sides were also delicious, and the portions were just right.

For dessert we ordered the four-berry tarte, which too was freaking incredible. I mean seriously, everything they brought out of the kitchen was just fantastic.

I can't wait to ""drag"" the hubs back. :) Hopefully SOON."
C8D_GU9cDDjbOJfCaGXxDQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Food is delicious, however the service is a bit slow. Don't go here if you are on a tight timeline :).

Great live music on Friday nights, so if you are looking for a different place, with lots going on in the background, with some good food, you should definitely check it out!"
1d6c6Q2j2jwVzBfX_dLHlg,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across. It's practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying, ""I want to go to Cowboy Ciao"" but we never made it. Then, thankfully, the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs' best friend!)

I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasn't about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank.

The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better?

For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)

I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!"

vUDqNV3RhI3FmZRwS7039g,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,3,"I really REALLY wanted to like this place, as I had heard good things, and I love JAZZ.

The atmosphere was ok, the food was ok, and the service was ok. I can't really say anything would stand out as memorable, other than the fantastic company I had that evening (an old, dear friend.)

I'm the type of person that if nothing stands out, then why go back? Maybe I'll have to check it out again later... but only if nothing else sounds good."
PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,5,"The hubs and I stopped in with friends this past weekend without knowing anything about this place. Holy moly, we love this place.

The service is awesome, starting from the hostesses to the waitstaff to the support staff. Our reservation was actually ready ON TIME and we were seated at a round table in the middle of the restaurant. Great ambiance - and it was just loud enough to be bustling, but not so loud that we couldn't hear each other.

Our server started by telling us that the portions are smaller and you order a few plates to share. Sounded fun to us!

We started the night off with a bottle of Malbec from Argentina (I don't remember the name) and it hit the spot. We took our server's suggestion and went with the focaccia di recco. It came to our table warm and oh my gosh, it was delicious. The honeycomb was such an interesting touch and added the right amount of sweetness to the focaccia & cheese.

We then ordered the house special ragu, which that night was a bolognese served over polenta. Again, delicious.

Our table then went a bit nuts and ordered a TON. Of. Stuff.

Here is the list, that I can remember:
- Orecchiette (SO good, with a spicy kick)
- Pork Belly
- Prosciutto Pizza
- Soppressata PIzza
- Grilled Asparagus Salad
- Gnocchi
- Davanti Sundae for dessert (of course)
- Peanut Butter mousse

We left incredibly full, and so happy. The menu is different the food is delicious, and I can't imagine ordering something that didn't taste delicious. I can't wait to go back!"
ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"A few weekends ago the hubs and I went to a hot air balloon festival at the Salt River Fields. Sadly, it was cold and windy, so our night of hot air balloon magic was shot by 8pm. On our way home we decided to stop by Crust for some dinner and drinks - we were both starving.

This place is small, but has many tables. The atmosphere is kind of loud, but is dark and soon you don't even hear the noise around you.

The first thing we did (as usual) was open the wine list and see what we could get. I was a little disappointed when I saw the wine prices. I am not a great wine drinker. I do not have discriminating tastes. At most restaurants you find a range of prices on the glasses and bottles so cheapskates and non-fancy people like me can enjoy a glass of vino for around $6 - $8. They did not offer anything under $11 a glass - which is fine, but I was a little sad (again, unfancy cheapie = me).

We ended up ordering some garlic knots - SO delicious but SO unhealthy. I loved them :). We also ordered their equivalent of a calzone, which was yummy. We had thought about ordering a pizza, but wanted to try something different. Next time we go we are definitely ordering some pizza, as all of the tables around us were enjoying some and it looked GOOD! Def recommend you stop by - hooray for hole-in-the-walls :)."
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Was brought here by a group of coworkers, that promised good things.

Good things is what I got!

Never had I heard of a Pasty.. and now I'm very glad we've been introduced. They are delicious! And the variety that Cornish Pasty Company provides is incredible.

I enjoyed the Rosemary Chicken (I had ordered the Salmon, however it was unavailable, sad... next time), and everything else my coworkers ordered looked and smelled delicious as well. The salads were huge, which is a plus."
OY0-hYJ2q6WiAqhYnCZZ0w,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"I was teetering between rating this place a 3 or a 4, but went with the 4 because at the end of the day, I know we'll be back.

We stopped by Saturday night after a lonnnnnng day of home repairs. The hubs deserved some good eats, so we headed over to the Brat Haus, as my hubs is a lover of all thing meat. (Wait, that can come off in a bad way... nevermind. He loves dead animal. How about that?)

We arrived shortly after a massive rain storm had hit, and the sky was still pretty dark & grey. The hostess immediately went to serve us outside, and I asked ""What is the plan should it start to rain again?"" Her answer: ""Ummm... I guess just run as fast as you can inside."" Cute. I'm 6 months pregnant. Not happening. I ask her if there is anything inside available - and she says no. I told her we'd wait. And she sort of huffed back to the hostess stand. Sorrrryyyyy for not wanting to get stuck in the rain.

We get back to the hostess area, and take a seat. We took a look and see how the place had changed from the Oregano's days. It was really neat! They took the parking area and created a large patio-type-seating place. Definitely would be great on a spring afternoon. As we were told that it'd be 15 minutes before we could be sat, imagine our surprise when moments later the hostess walked over and said, ""I just bused a table inside for you, so we are set."" Hooray!

We walked inside, and to our surprise THERE WAS NO ONE SEATED INSIDE. Well, that's a lie, there were two couples. But there were about 15 seats available. Seriously? No seating inside? I get annoyed with bad service far more than I get annoyed by bad food.

So we sit. Our server pops over and explains the menu. Quite an interesting selection of Brats, and I was happy to see they had burgers & salads as well. The hubs ordered a beer (forgot the name) and I ordered a root beer. We also ordered a pretzel to split.

The pretzel came, and was HOT. Fresh out of the oven, which is awesome, however it was SO hot we couldn't eat it for about five minutes while it cooled. When it was cooled, we took bites and it was good! Not life changing, but it worked. The root beer was Dad's Rootbeer, served ice-cold out of the bottle. The hubs said his beer was 'thick'. I took his word for it, but he finished it & liked it.

For dinner, the hubs ordered the 'celebrity chef special' brat which that week was something by Justin Beckett, and I ordered a cheese burger. We also ordered a side of fries to split.

The food came quickly and was yummy. The hubs ordered his Brat with the rootbeer onions on top, which were OK, but he thinks he'll go a different direction in the future. My burger was awesome - perfectly cooked and the sides & sauces on top were perfectly mixed. The 'Hush Hush' sauce they put on top is basically a thousand island... or McDonald's 'Secret' sauce. Get it? Hush-Hush vrs Secret Sauce? Hilar.

The fries were good, and the sauce we had selected - the Blue Cheese Bacon - to dip them in was good. Kind of watery, but you definitely got a smoked bacon taste as you ate.

We were meeting friends for dessert or I would have been ALL OVER the shakes or floats I saw heading out of the kitchen.

We'll definitely go back and try more menu items... I'll just make sure not to have high expectations for the hostess staff. For now at least..."

I first went to Postinos on a date, and it was incredible. (I'm referring to both the guy & the food!)

The wine list is incredible - and there are almost always specials going on so you can try something new without breaking the bank. The food is delicious - I always suggest anyone try the bruchetta planks, and any of their salads are a delicious choice. I love both the Arcadia and Central locations the same; Arcadia seems to be where I frequent the most just due to proximity of our home. If you haven't been, just try it!

It's a fantastic lunch spot, if you are able, sit on the patio. Even if it is chilly out, they will sometimes have a fire going in their adorable fireplace. If not, they have space heaters.

If you are going for dinner, anywhere you sit is a good time. It is not a quiet place inside, but that isn't the vibe of Chelsea's.

The bar is fun to sit at - an indoor/outdoor set up, the staff is friendly and the drink selection varies enough that you can get an incredible vintage bottle, or a $26 bottle to suit your budget.

The food is incredible! I have enjoyed everything from their taco plates to pan-fried chicken to seafood. It is all delicious, and the servings are generous.

For dessert the hubs and I always get the ice-cream sundae, where you can add your own toppings at the table. May sound silly, but it's something fun we do... and it's a bit of a tradition now.  If you haven't had the pleasure of going to Chelsea's, drop by if you are able. You won't regret it."

There is a bit of a wait if you go during peak times; however it is worth it.

The caprice salad, when they have it, is INCREDIBLE. Do not pass that up if your server mentions it. On a budget? Pick up a bottle in the store (prices do start around $9.99) and they'll open it for you to enjoy at dinner (or before dinner if you are waiting.)

The pizzas may sound kind of funky if you are new to the joint, but don't fear. They know what they are doing."
8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"A few weeks ago a friend sent me a text message of what looked like corndogs with powdered sugar on them. The caption read ""You have to check this place out"". Being a person that believes that any food you put on a stick must be delicious, I was intrigued and found out later that those were NOT corndogs, rather they were Waffle Dogs... a piece of sausage, dipped in waffle batter, and deep fried. SOLD!

After a morning hike the hubs and I headed over to the Over Easy location on Indian School and we did wait about 20 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was full of people, always a good sign.

We sat down, were greeted by a very busy, but friendly, server. We ordered the waffle dogs, the hubs got the 'wolf pack' and I ordered off the menu, just an egg, some tomatoes and toast. (Sadly, I am watching what I eat, and figured that the waffle dogs were more than enough to guilt me the rest of the day)

The table behind us asked the same server what Over Easy was known for, and his answer ""We are known for everything except for our healthy options"". I laughed because the joint DOES have some great healthy options, including omelets, yogurt with granola, etc however those don't hold a candle to the incredibly creative and delicious options that the menu is filled with.

Both of our orders were delicious, and we will definitely be back. If you haven't been to either location, I highly suggest you check it out. Local, fun, creative and delicious. Annie likes."
zqNgwQjj0_XAll-neGikIw,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,2,"I was excited to try Merci, as I've heard / read great reviews.

Went for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend. We met at noon, and there were probably about five other tables sitting down & eating when we arrived. We were greeted warmly and told to sit where we liked.

Our server quickly stopped by & was polite. We both ordered an open-face sandwich, and my friend ordered a bowl of asparagus soup - she was excited to know that it was vegan & made fresh.

It was at this point that our experience turned from being great to 'meh'. We waited for nearly 45 mins to get our sandwiches. Someone (not our server) did stop by and let us know that our orders were under way & apologized for the wait. When our sandwiches finally came, my friend asked about her soup - and was told it would be out shortly. She then asked to cancel the order, as she really didn't think she'd have room to try it after the sandwich. Why they didn't think to bring it out during the previous 45 minutes we were waiting is beyond me.

About five minutes later we called our server over and asked how long their crepes took to make. I'm 7 months pregnant, and once I saw that they had Nutella Crepes on the menu, it was really all I could think about. She said about 10 minutes - so I asked her to put an order in (worried that it would take far longer, judging how long the sandwiches took.)

She came out to our table a short time later and informed us that they were all out of crepes. But they had ice-cream, should I want that. I am by no means an expert or even remotely experienced with running a restaurant, but how do you run out of crepes? I have made them before- you put a few ingredients together & then cook them on the stove. AND there is a grocery store in the same complex, so if you had run out of, let's say, eggs - couldn't you go buy some? I know I'm pregnant and not really that patient when it comes to craving, but come on.

The food we did get to eat was good. The people who work there were friendly, but I was by no means 'wowed' enough to plan a trip back."

We started with the warm brie & caramelized apples.... so good. My hubs is a cheese connoisseur (that or he just eats A LOT of cheese) and he even raved about how good the brie was.

I then had the warm chopped veggie salad --- mouth watering and flavorful! The hubs had the crab cakes - of which I snagged more than one forkful. Those too were delicious.

The atmosphere is adorable - cozy, like a friend's home. The service was great as well - if you are looking to grab a bite for lunch in Old Town, you gotta stop here."
-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"The hubs and I tried this place after a long day of shopping (more so long for him than myself.)

We arrived around 7:30 or so on a Saturday night, and had about a 30 minute wait for a table. We grabbed a stool at the bar and had a drink while we waited. The staff was friendly and the overall vibe of the place was laid back.

We got to our table and the server was over quickly to say hi while we looked at the menu.

I ordered a basic burger while the hubs ordered a mediterranean style burger.

The burgers were incredible! I love a good burger, but rarely am I ever swooning over one. Oh it was delicious.

We were too full for dessert or milkshakes, so that is on the to-do list next visit."
0jAexNHRHhkQv4zNYqenBA,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Went here with some friends for some drinks & gub on a Saturday afternoon. I like the layout of the place - and we were even able to watch some college football which was a nice bonus.

For food we ordered some tacos - chicken, beef & duck carnitas. DELICIOUS! In fact we had to order more because the hubs at mine and I wasn't about to miss out on any of the goodness.

Also, they DO sell boxes of wine for $30... so of course we ordered one. Other than the horrific hangover the next day, it was definitely a great time. I haven't been at night, seeing as how I'm old and can barely stay awake past 10pm, but I've heard from friends that it's a good time. Maybe one crazy night I'll stay out late enough to give it a shot..."
4dCOilGYflzGzizOPKyvow,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"Stopped in today for our second visit, and was yet again won over by this little neighborhood jewel. Our first visit was for dinner, I ordered the grilled miso salmon - it was AWESOME. Hubs ordered the 'Roti & Rib' and thankfully he let me take a bite. I'm not a big fan of ribs, but these were just delicious! We then enjoyed some wine, good conversation, and good atmosphere.

Today we stopped by for lunch, and were lucky to snag a seat on the patio. Again, the service was great. I ordered the veggie chop salad w /roasted chicken. It was so delicious! Chop salads can be tough to get right, and Grassroots did a smashing good job if I do say so myself. No wine today, as I had to go back to work after, but it would have been a perfect day for it. Highly recommend!"
W8xG9Bzk3TPPkBR5jx1pgg,dUSyNUAp_pGeb2aNcBEGpQ,4,"I loved this place when it was Estate House..... though I never ate there. Just drank. Lots. But I did love the fact that it was a rooftop bar, with a great view of downtown or the waterfront, depending on which side you sat. Who doesn't love a good glass of wine on a warm spring day, while watching the sun set? This girl loves it.

I was sad when Estate House closed, but was hopeful that something else just as great would open up. I think some sort of Cigar bar opened there... which I never went to. But then, as per usual in old town, that closed too, and then I heard rumblings of this new lounge opening.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm no longer hip. A big night out for me is staying up until 10:30pm. I was a bit worried about heading to Casablanca after dinner one night with friends and all the cool people at the bar laughing at me. Well, I can say, they didn't laugh. They were actually very low key, nice and welcoming. We sat outside, enjoyed some great drinks - and my husband just adored their Scotch selection.

We have gone back a few times for after dinner drinks - and each time we have a blast. I love this place - I really really hope it sticks!"

Chop and Wok is that place. And I'm glad I finally went to that place. Dive bar, great food, great people, cheap drinks. The hubs and I went there to meet friends who ate dinner there before we arrived. They raved about the food, and we really enjoyed our strong drinks. We were even happier when the check came and it was surprisingly low.

We went back later for dinner and really enjoyed the food! I'm glad we finally stopped in. I'm excited to stumble into the other places I have been eying for year, yet never ventured into."

I got into the habit of getting a slice or two after I work out at the gym, and the slices were just o.k. That was because they heated up the slices from a pizza they made earlier.  But one weekend, I ordered a large, freshly made pie and what a difference! Some of the best tasting pizza I've ever had!  I've been going to N.Y.P.D. since they opened, and the staff has recently changed (within the last year or so).  The original staff I all knew by name are long gone. They'd throw in a free soda quite often, but after checking with the newer employees, a lot of the original ones were let go for giving out freebies.  Too bad. A little hospitality goes a long way in my opinion."

I read some of the other reviews, and the theme is the same... not a great place, but a good location to view Mill Ave. from the balcony and some very good brewed beer.  Their second floor location is very cool. It's a good place to hang out if you've trolled up and down Mill Ave. and need to relax for a while.  Chrsty L. hit the nail on the head when she said she would never say ""Hey, let's go to Gordon Biersch tonight.""  I wouldn't say that either.  Food is just o.k."

There are very few places to eat near the Capitol, but La Canasta not only provides a place for a bite to eat, but some good food as well. I don't like veggies, so I generally stick to the red chili beef burrito, which is very good.  Prices are reasonable, too. I think their main business comes from the government workers in the area, and lot's of police and fifi's (firefighters).  If the PD and fifi's eat there, it must be good.  Free chips and salsa (very GOOD salsa) is a definite plus! Also, I've heard their breakfast burrito's are excellent."

The building they are located in is crappy, but the food is great. Nine times out of ten I'll get the open faced turkey sandwich, which is made with REAL home cooked turkey, not processed meat, with real mashed potato's and cranberry sauce. Excellent! Friends also recommend the steak sandwich, which you have to ask for. It's not on the menu, but they are more than happy to make it for you. If you want to impress your friends, park in back and take them in through the service entry doors, and on into the restaurant. It's kind of like Durant's, without the atmosphere."

This restaurant is located within a half mile of where I live, so I always order food to go.  The staff is excellent, the food is very, very good, and the pick up window is usually fast (sometimes they get very busy and you have a bit of a wait).  They also have what they call ""curbside delivery"", which means you can drive up to the south side of the building near the take out door, and stay in your vehicle.  They will come to you. Try the hot and sour soup, it's the best. Several of their dishes are made with hot spices, which I love, so if you are calling in and order and don't like your food spicey, be sure to let them know.  Pei Wei is a less expensive chain associated with P.F. Chaing's China Bistro."

You won't find a more authentic Irish pub in Arizona.  Plenty of choices for beer on tap, although no domestic beer on tap.  If you go, get the fish & chips or the shepherd's pie.  If Andy is tending bar, you'll be well taken care of.  Check out Andy's authentic collection of police patches around the bar area."

The bar is located on Warner just west of Kyrene on the north side of the street.  Lot's of beer brands available, both on tap and bottles.  Food is nothing to write home about, what I would call average quality. I'm sure the guys are not there for the quality of the food. I'd guess they are there for the outfits worn by the waitressess, which, by the way, are quite applealing. My buddies and I golf a lot in the east valley, so it's a good place to get a bite to eat after playing 18 holes."

Although located in a strip mall, once inside, you'll forget that your in a strip mall.  Ruffino's is quiet and dark inside, great for a couple looking for a good meal or just to talk.

The food is excellent, assuming you like Italian food.  The service is great and the staff seem to know if you are there to get to know each other.  In other words, they know when to leave you alone.

I agree with a previous reviewer that the prices are a little steep, so it's not the place to go every week.  However, I've been living in the area since 1994 and Ruffino's has always been there, so they must be doing something right."

Sat at the bar and based on the reviews I've read, I was expecting some great things from the staff. While the service was prompt, it wasn't very friendly. I'm a pretty plain eater, so I had the turkey sandwich, with mayo on the side, The meat was excellent, but the bun was a little disappointing. If I go back, I'll ask for it on white sandwich bread. The prices are a little steep, but with such a location, that's expected (Convention Center across the street and the Suns and Diamondbacks just one block south). For a Monday afternoon, there was quite a crowd there (mostly businessmen and some convention attendees)."

I hadn't seen Murphy's Stout on tap since my trip to Ireland in 1986.  Robbie's has it!  I tried their fish and chips for lunch.  It comes in two sizes, small and large.  I got the small, and it was the best fish and chips I've had since I had it at Seamus McCaffrey's in downtown Phoenix.  I introduced myself to Robbie Fox (yes, he was there) and came to find out I worked with his now ex-wife.  As Robbie said, ""what a small world it is"".  I like Robbie's better than Rula Bula (sorry, Rula). They have an excellent outdoor bar, too.  It's the first outdoor bar I've seen with beer on tap available."

There are wide variety of selection in this restaurant, not only your typical sushi but also variety of hot authentic japanese dishes from the grill (way beyond teriyaki). Ordered the hamachi kama ... oh so yummm ...

The appetizers are fantastic and staffs were very information and services are very good. They never leave you glass empty, even for water

Had the grilled cheese and meatball for appetizers ... those are AWESOME !!! Good way to start a meal.. (these are where my 3 stars come from)

the menu is pretty small, probably have only 10 items on it... With the fantastic start, the main dishes came out a bit disappointing. I ordered the pork stews which is good and flavorful ... but the taste is so strong that toward half of the dishes I can't keep on eating it ...  Tried the fishes from my friends, a bit toward the fishy side. I know expecting fresh fish in the desert may be a bit much to ask for ... but then at least season it more to get rid of the fish taste ....
And warning... stay away from the chicken & dumpling. It has no taste to it at all ... my friend hated it.

However, not too much into their curry though, a bit of the sweet side for my taste but overall the food qualify is probably among the top 5 I have tried in the valley ....   and the price is very reasonable

But you know, once in a blue moon, you do crave for some grease and beefy meat patty ... hence, I landed in Red Robin.

I must admit that this place is quite good. The burger actually tastes much better than what I remember from way back when I last ate one. Ordered the mushroom burger and the guacamole burger with bacon, with sweet potato fries (this is my weakness of all) and the onion rings.... ohh they are good.
Though the patty could be juicier, but I will say it definitely well worth the price and very good place for burger.  Guys/gals, forget about McBurger, and JackBurger ... this place is just couple dollars more but taste oh that much better.

As I get there, I was very doubtful it could be any good judging by the deco. I do agree that it looks very out-dated and definitely need some work in both of the interior and exterior .... but the service was good and that I can see they offer a some specialty dishes on their chinese menu.  I am not sure about the buffet but if you were to order off the menu, it is actually very good. A lot of authentic cantonese dishes , I had the black pepper beef and the fish stomach with veggies. The beef was very tendered and it was very favorful with a lot of ""wok heh""  and the fish stomach were very good as well, I haven't been able to found this dish in Phoenix till here. I was very impressed. And the pre-ordered winter melon soup was outstanding, it was huge and with plenty of soup and ingredient inside, and will feed 5-6 people easily.  I haven't had this for years and was very happy with the way the cook it, as if I were having it in Hong Kong.

Highly recommended this place if you know what to order or have a friend that do.  I have never been to their buffet and still have no intent to try it ... so I cannot speak for that.

To tell if a sushi place is good, it starts from the rice. Don't underestimate the skill you need for that ... it's not just your normal 'press the rice cooker button' type of rice.  Only the true master can skillfully determine the right amount of rice to water proportion, time to cook it with the perfect blend of vinegar and seasoning to make good sushi rice.
The rice of this place is toward the soft side, bit too much water and overpowered by the amount of vinegar.

The freshness of the fish are in question... we tried number of nigiri and rolls ... the escolar and scallop are pretty good... but the salmon was a disappointment. You can just tell by the color ..

There are very good variety of selection in term of vegetable, seafood, meat, and other hotpot items. The stocks were not bad either, had the ying-yang pot ... do note that the spicy one is indeed very spicy in this place.

What is nice about the hot pot buffet is that, the regular buffet is included in it ... but honestly, I wouldn't care for that too much ... tried couple items and won't recommend that. But it's still nice to have that choice and you can get appetizer and dessert complimentary to your hot pot :)

But in comparison to some real good Pho I had before, it is not much to wave about ... the broth is good but not great.  I also had the vermicelli, it is a ok.  The quantity is much smaller and the price run on the higher side than most of the Vietnamese place I have been to.  But given the location and the rent in this area, I think it is justified.

The place is clean and service is good. Obviously a family run business with a very homey feeling to it. Another quick fix for my Asian crave ...

The seasoning on the short ribs were just right and I can tell the quality of the meat is pretty good. As for the tofu soup... oh so yummm ... with plenty of seafood in it.  I really like this place as they don't put much MSG like other korean places I have been to. And I love the fact that when they say spicy, it means spicy. I have been to places that I ordered extra spicy but I barely taste any spice. So be careful on that if it's not your thing ;)

And oh another thing to give this place a thumb up is that you don't come out smelling like BBQ :)"

But it doesn't live up to expectation unfortunately, first off, the location is very remote and next to a car rental and supply store ... not that impressed.  As for the decor, it's decent ... nothing to rave about
Service was very good ... but the food was just a OK.  Ordered the 5 course tasting menu , plus there are a lot of bite-size bonus dishes, some of them are pretty good ... but some are just so so ...

I did expect it will be big plate with few piece of this and that with a lot of decoration ... but given that, I did expect each dish would be like ""wow"" ....  but unfortunately none of them are .... they are not bad but certainly not out of the world ... I certainly have much better for that price range."
lwxu6HwzEAhben5oVTw-8g,300bVlfTh_IezEJ6R84bTg,4,"Very good Boba tea ... the best I have had in AZ so far. Will definitely go back !!! Had the Jasmine boba tea with lychee jelly, the taste is just right with the right amount of milk and sugar, not excessively sweet and the aroma of it just great ... feel like I was having it in Hong Kong or Taiwan.
Also had the famous Taiwanese snack, ""popcorn chicken"" . Very authentic and tasty.... and very juicy ....  I don't usually like fried food, but this is YUMMMMM ....

Will definitely go back next time I am in that part of the valley to try more of their food and see. As far as the location and decor, it is a OK.

Recommended for quick snack and boba :)"

This is where I was first introduced to 'chaat' from my desi friends and fell in love with it.  All the chaat are vegetarian ... but oh they are so good

I honestly cannot speak if it is authentic or not ... but they are certainly yummy with a very reasonable price. One of the mom & pop type of place, they have pictures on the wall for the non native like me to order from ... but the best way yet is bring your indian friends.... you will find plenty of tasty surprise that is not on the picture

The only reason this place is missing a star was that it doesn't feel very neat given it is inside a grocery store and have very few tables ..."
2uRM8Et0uJVl8u1jSnmuKw,300bVlfTh_IezEJ6R84bTg,3,"Thinking to spend the evening in a restaurant for a long talk to catch up with your old friends, this will be your place.

The restaurant is located at the intersection of scottsdale & shea .... when you drove by, it is very easy to spot as this is probably the only restaurant / shop open in the plaza.  Inside out, the ambience of the restaurant is great if you can overlook the shopping center is kind of run-down.  It doesn't look like your typical thai restaurant. It has low light and very chic deco, quite a cute place I must say in term of ambience.

In term of food, the quality is a OK ... nothing to wow about. Ordered basil beef and the uncle som's seafood ... both are good traditional thai food. It's good but nothing out of the ordinary, both the cut of meat and seafood are not great ... I can get the same quality of dishes at another Thai restaurant right around the corner for 50% off their price. This is not a place for the value of food, rather, the price you pay is more for the ambience.

And I must agree with my fellow yelpers that the service is SLOW ... yes, I do undersand that everything is made to order ... but honestly, so do any other thai restaurant. Thai food is not something you can pre-cook anyway.   And in term of slow, it's not only in the kitchen, also the front end service. Our server was slow , not in term of time to place order and checking ...  but he was slow to understand ... or he was plain ignoring what was requested.  I asked for the pepper tray THREE times .... still no pepper tray when I paid the bill. And he got the bill wrong and I kindly pointed that out to him, and he brought back the exact same bill :-\ ... not the kind of service I would expect in this type of restaurant.

Overall, good place to spend the evening to have long conversation and have decent food with good atmosphere if you are willing to pay for the ambience"

It is all about the EXPERIENCE ...
Went with a group of friends for birthday dinner and had their 4 course dinner and averaging an hour per course ....
So do set aside plenty of time and tummy space to enjoy each of the course. The 4 course dinner will give you the full fondue experience but it is indeed a lot of food.  From the cheese fondue, salad, entree, dessert, everything is absolutely delicious and the dessert is totally out of the world. If nothing else, everyone should at least come try their chocolate fondue .... they have happy hour for a very good price
And if you are up for a early dinner or a very late dinner, they have special for $35 for 3 course meal. But I think they have some restriction on what day it is offered, so check ahead.

Overall, wonderful experience, great services, awesome conversation spot, and fantastic food.

Finally got to try their happy hours .... it was as good as I could remember ... and for $5.00/person ... you cannot beat that .... the only thing is that they have only couple of spots .... so come in early to get your spot"

But I am pleasantly surprised ...

I wanted dessert and wanted something different from the normal AJ stuffs (they are good I know... just wasn't feeling it)
I ordered the tropical cake ... OMG, it was so good !!! The cake is perfectly moist and with layered home-made whipped cream along with bunch of tropical fruit .... oh did I mention I love my whipped-cream & strawberry :P   The whipped cream is so heavenly creamy ... and not overly sweet, just perfect with the natural sweetness from the fruit ... haven't had cake that is so good for a long while.... yummmmm

I cannot speak for their noodles or other dishes ... but it seems promising.  Will try it someday, cute little place inside"

Right outside the Mekong supermarket ... really can't beat that ...
I guess given its geographic advantage, the quality is only secondary.

I went there twice, the first time, my impression was OK pho as I was with a group of friend and didn't pay as much attention.
2nd time... went there after grocery in Mekong and paid a bit more attention to the food .... honestly, it's really just a OK, or can I say OK-minus

If you were in the area and looking for good pho, I would recommend to go across the street to Blue-Moon. Much cheaper (like $5-6 vs $8+) .. i know we are talking about 2 bucks .... but hey that's like 40%, and the quality is much better...
But if you were really craving for pho and can't just wait to cross the street, this is a OK place."

They have happy hours with seafood pancake for ~$6 (normal ~$15 I think) that I yet to try  ... overall a good place for winter comfort"

Though to make this place awesome, there is one criteria .... you have to be reasonably awesome yourself too... meaning you will be brave to ask the server for the chinese menu and though u may not understand everything ... still order from that menu anyway. I promise you won't be disappointed. Highly recommending ""Liu San Shen""

OK, on the day you are not feeling very awesome, there are still a good american chinese menu. Try the Mu shu chicken/pork, they are the best I have and do ask for recommendation from the server.

This is one of the few mom & pop's type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic
This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town, way better than the big chain like Brios (don't get me wrong, they are not bad either)

It is not a fancy place but very cozy. And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia .... the owners are 100% italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients ....  I had the best lasagna there, you can taste the texture of the noodle, the creamy-ness of the chess, the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes... totally awesome.
Had tried the seafood linguine there too .... oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood ... definitely 2 thumbs up.

During winter, make sure you make reservation ahead though .... this place seems to be snowbirds' favorite too"

The bulgogi was very well seasoned and extremely tender, and the soup was very very flavorful and with plenty of seafood and tofu in there...The side dishes are very fresh and good as well

And I love the furniture here, very well crafted and authentic... and the staffs are very friendly.

Definitely highly recommended, especially if you live in the north scottsdale or phoenix area, this is much closer than driving down to tempe/chandler area for good asian food"

Not sure why they have sport channel playing ... totally doesn't go with the place ...

It is at the busy corner of Frank Lloyd Wright and Scottsdale, a very convenience location. The place is cozy and very welcoming, and the service was good and portion is hearty. The owner (or his son) actually took the time to tell us what are the upcoming deal.

Food is good. My friend had the Salmone alla Francesca which was a little plain, but she said the vegetable was good. And I had the Linguine Clams with white chardonnay sauce, I would probably give it a 3.5 out of 5. The taste is very mild and you can actually taste the Clams which is nice but I think it can be better.

Overall a good place especially with the Groupon deal.
Recommended for friend gathering, causal date."

The place is located in the PV area ... easy to find and nice area.  The place seems clean and nice ... I think it is trying too hard to be a fusion/sushi/sport bar to cater everyone which just doesn't really work ... having buffalo chicken wing and a big screen playing hockey can't qualify you to be a sport bar

Had some sushi roll and nigiri  ... the texture of the rice just not right ... you can't use chinese/thai rice to make sushi, it just simply not is... and had the cucumber wrap with tuna inside ... good try but the cucumber are sliced too thick (this is where you can see the skill of the chef) that the dish is losing its essence.

Though I would give them credit for the pricing ... it's good price given its location. Also, even if you are not at Happy hour, you can get 1/2 off sushi for yelp check in."

As soon as I stepped in to the restaurant, it is already a ""Like"" ... playing some really awesome cuban cha-cha-cha music and the atmosphere was great. A very cute place and love the bee-hive in the middle.

As for the food, had the empanaditas ... very good, and the puerto rican sampler was a good way to try couple of things at once.  Overall food was pretty good .... it's not like ""WOW"" type of food ... but good for my tummy.  Will certainly go back on a Friday/Saturday night when they have the live band playing to do some cha-cha or salsa ;-)

Ordered some nigiri and rolls ... was A-OK ... fish is not exactly fresh and the sushi rice doesn't has enough favor to it. I would give the food a passing grade of 3 stars

But the service and atmosphere took away a star to make it two ... as soon as you walked in, I am not sure if it's the decor or the feng shui in this restaurant ... the energy is just so low that you can see that on the tired sushi chefs' face and spotty memory staffs' action ... not only one of the order was forgotten, we have to remind them to go get the change for our bill .... ~_~"

Went there for a Saturday lunch with only few people around and enjoyed the seating outside with such great weather, so the overall ambient was totally 5 stars.   I will check it out again at night and see how the scene likes ...

As for the food, me and my friend shared two of the lunch bento boxes with a variety of food from miso soup, salad, tempura, teriyaki, sushi to roll and dessert (green tea and red bean ice-cream)... Food was ok, not a whole lot to rave about. But again, this type of restaurant, you go there more for the atmosphere than food.  So in that sense, it met my expectation.

Will recommend this place for a night-out, or date place"

Love the dosa (it is pancake like texture that the waitstaff bring to the table fresh made)... and Rasam (signature soup from s.india from what I heard) ... everything else taste really good too ....

I normally go to pho restaurant down on camelback and 16th ave (i think) to get my fix ... but oh my yelps brother and sister ... you saved me from the long drive and gas money to go to that side of town now.

First, let just talk about the pricing ... I must say this is probably among the cheapest pho I have had in my life .... 3.50 to start with just noodle and soup, and depending on the number of topping 0.50 each you choose, you just add to it.  The gas money I saved came into good use here .... ;-)

Second, being just cheap is not enough. You are a savy yelper... quality is not an option but a must. And this place is actually good. For pho, as you know , the broth is the key and as soon as you go inside the restaurant, you can just smell how good it is. And I like it even more when I taste it that it is not toward the sweet side like most other pho restaurant. Another star added.

Will definitely come back for sure ... it seems they have many other variety of dishes as well, will try them out and let y'all all know later :)"

This is not your typical scottsdale fusion sushi place with all the nice decor, chic ambience with fancy cocktails. Instead you will find this a solid family business restaurant with clean interior, fresh and authentic sushi. The owner and head chef is always there and you will often find quite some japanese regulars hanging there. Isn't this always a good sign to tell if the food is authentic ;)

In term of food, I must say I had better indian food before. Order one chaat (street snack) and two curry dishes, one goat , one spinach chicken. They were good but a little lack in term of favor ...  I think it is cater toward American taste. I didn't see any desi people in this place other than my friend ... this is certainly a sign of its authenticity  Also their naan has too much butter on it ... not exactly my taste

Service is a bit on the slow side but overall good.
Nice stop if you are close to the area but if you want better chaat, try little india.  Or some good indian food, try indian paradise (north valley)

Selfishly I don't want to recommend this place because of the possibility of making this so popular that I worry that there wouldn't be enough supply for my demand.  However my rating would suffice in this easy recommendation.

One of the easiest description to this would be frozen cotton candy.  The uncanny fluffiness to this desert marvel topped with fruit toppings and condensed milk is a taste you'll be back for more. This is simply a no-brainer during 115 degree weather, but the shaved ice is a treat you worth having even during cold days of Arizona.  Though I haven't tried the Snoh drinks, I would give it a try at my next stop.

Service is friendly and they make good recommendations.  The place with it's trendy decor, Instagram artwork and Flat screen TVs adds to your visual stimulation as you wait for your desert.  I would opt for the large size in a dish with split flavors with original and something you're willing to try.

My only hope is that my fantastic review doesn't get lost in the ""filtered"" black hole of reviews for the site.

We came here for my wife and mom's birthday for dinner and let's say we were not prepared for the high decibel ambiance.  We had what was recommended from Michelle L. and other reviews.
1. Soft pretzel with provolone fondue - 4 stars.
2. 32 hour ribs - 4 stars
3. Salted caramel custard - 5 stars.
4. Sausage and mushroom Gnocchi - 3 star

After walking in you have beautiful chandeliers and modern decor.  There is a stage for live band music which we sat in front of.  Thankfully we were finished with our meal before the band began.  We could hardly hear our waiter and he had difficult time hearing us as well.

Although there was a good crowd in the restaurant and they didn't mind the noise level, but noise level was too high and distracting for us which the food was not able to overcome.  If the chef or owner was truly a culinary dropout, it was because he couldn't hear the instructions in class.

I've been here 3 or 4 times and have experienced both premium and premium PLUS seating.  If you are going to come here, BECOME a member online then buy your tickets in the premium plus seating.  You'll get the experience of IPIC at a savings.  (This is when you plan for date night with your wife). You can save up to $8.50 (total price would be $18.50) and get pillow and blanket, free bag of popcorn, and valet parking (Another $6.00 savings). You won't get junk mail, but you may get the occasional spam mail in your e-mail.  DON'T even bother with Premium (nonPLUS) seating. Chairs don't recline and are not comfortable.  You have to bring in your own food that you bought in the lobby.  None of the extras you would get in premium plus.  Your money is better spent at AMC Esplanade 14 or even Harkins theater.  You end up feeling like you are in coach class on an airplane. Seriously.  This would definitely make you look cheap on a date.  Guys take a lesson.

IPIC is impressive in its appearance.  Has the look and feel of a trendy night club and bar. The Restrooms are also trendy as well.  Who would have guessed you needed all that in a restroom as well.  Also, I call it the Wine Vending Machine which is pretty cool and great selection. IPIC is very impressive in the premium plus furnishing, ambiance, and decor.

What is not impressive is the food and service.  For what you are paying, the food is anything but memorable.  I guess they feel that if you are watching a good movie in a recliner, liquored up in the dark that your taste buds stop working.  Also when you need your waiter, you have to go out of the theater to get them or wait for them to come around to get their attention in the middle of the movie.  Bad experience especially when they get your order wrong.  AMC Esplanade did get this part right by using a ""call button"" at your seat.  At least on coach seats on your plane there is one as well.

I would suggest that you spend your money on dinner before the movie outside the theater at the other restaurants, but come in only for your popcorn and desert and drink.  At least this way you have been well fed and can enjoy the IPIC experience.

Although several reviews seems to like the happy hour aspect of Ling & Louie's, this review is only for the dining and service presented after coming here twice.  The decor is clean, but decor seams a bit dark.  I suppose this is more for the ambiance of a bar and those enjoying happy hour.  I had the vegetarian fried rice which was nothing more than fried rice topped with fried tofu on the top.  I didn't like the presentation of the dish, but the taste was better than it looked.  My wife and the ahi sliders which were creative and tasty, but her toasted buns were a bit burnt on top.

Our waiter seemed to be friendly and present however after the bill was paid, you couldn't find him to get a refill on our water.  (I suppose this would be what is expected in an Asian restaurant)

They have to update their menu.  There are several items on menu they no longer serve and menus on items that are not even close to the picture.  When asked about why items are not given, waitress states that there customers are non-ethnic therefore food quality and taste is catered to that customer base.  (This translates to a less authentic menu and dining experience).  Experience becomes frustrating and waitress response was very defensive which made for awkward moment.  There's potential, but there are also better Vietnamese restaurants.

Great first impression. This seems to be under new ownership and had remodeling.  There specials are Mi Quang and Bun Bo hue.  The Mi Quang (see picture) is pleasant delight mixed with large yellow rice noodles, fresh vegetables, shrimp, chicken, and hard boiled quail eggs.  The soup is savory with a hint of chili spice and when eaten together with rice chip it has a terrific compliment of taste and texture which leaves you with a smile of goodness.  Since the other Vietnamese restaurants don't make this dish, this is easily a hidden gem and probably best in Phoenix if not AZ.

Facilities are clean and service is friendly.   The wait staff came over once to fill our water glasses and once to ask how was our meals. (Easily should be done since we were the only ones present).  It is easily seen that this is family owned as most Vietnamese establishments as kids are running and playing throughout the restaurant.  Not sure about ROA (ratio of authenticity) because we were the only ones there on a Sunday brunch.  Well have to be back.  Cost is a little more than you would find at Da Vang or Pho thanh."

I was looking forward to coming here.  I have become a foodie. My wife and I love to try new places and support local restaurants.  Rice Paper was on my list of places to try.  The place looks like a converted residential home turned restaurant.  The place was clean and trendy.  Service was great and friendly.  The server even brought our dogs some water to drink out side.  However the food didn't fulfill my expectations for a truly Vietnamese meal experience.  There was a lacking of authentic flavor in our dishes.  I believe the Pho was lacking in taste and substance as the meal was very humble and seems shy in the true taste of Pho.  ""Enlighten me"" spring roll was interesting as well.  I did like the crunch from the fried wonton skins in the roll however the jalapeno was a bit overpowering for me.  Salads were forgettable too.

Ratio of authenticity (ROA)  #Ethnic Patrons/Total # Patrons 0.1 (includes my party).  Although not very authentic in Vietnamese cuisine, it did show potential in some of their originality in their spring rolls.

Price was high as it is rare to have the price of pho at a whopping $10.

There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants which is worth the experience at half the cost.  (You may have to put up with poor service, but at least your stomach will be satisfied.)

After perusing the menu, we decided to ask for recommendations of what is the most authentic on the menu.  Jan launched into Thai and the conversation rapidly took off onto a tangent about ice cream.  We finally got back to the food and was recommended these dishes:

- Pad Kee Mow ($10) - stir-fried wide rice noodles with variety of veg and basil
- Pad Grapow ($10) - stir-fried onions, basil, bell pepper
- Arizona Heat Wave ($12) - interesting name for red curry

Each comes with choice of meat.  We picked beef and chicken.  We asked for both white and brown rice which are provided without additional charge - a nice touch. We asked for medium spicy and the seasoning was spot on. Good balance of salty, spicy and sweet which is what makes Thai food so addictive.  I also liked the amount of vegetables that come with each dish, although more than what is traditional, it seems more healthy.  The food was so tasty we had to ask for another round of rice.

Even though we live 5 min from Osha, we've been afraid to try it for fear of being disappointed since we cook pretty decent Thai food at home.  I'm glad we finally took the plunge and look forward to going back for the excellent Pad Kee Mow, in particular.  Note that Osha is family run so the service can be a bit laid-back which is, actually, very Thai.

The deboned and stuffed chicken wings were definitely the highlight.  Everything else was above average compared to other Thai places in town.  Portions were generous and the quality of ingredients quite high.  The Spicy Basil would have benefited from more basil to compliment the perfectly cooked tender beef.  The BBQ chicken was disappointingly bland and the sauce it was served with was too sweet and not what's traditionally used.

I was expecting the food to be spicier after reading the previous reviews.  Next time I'll have to ask them for Thai spicy."

Good selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.

I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.

Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.

If you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh."

I've decided to remove two stars from my rating because my recent visits have just been disappointing.  The grilled pork is more baked than grilled - no smokiness or tasty charred bits anywhere.  The pho tastes more of MSG than boiled beef bones.  And service is as bad as ever.  I wonder if Da Vang's popularity has led it to take shortcuts for efficiency.

Definitely not worth going out of your way for - go to Khai Hoan in Tempe for the smokey grilled pork or Saigon Nites in Scottsdale for the delicious pho instead.

44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant.  The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente, not greasy, well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing.

We also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.

Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House, it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables), albeit a bit oily.

The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House."
QdvROupQvDDQIaHrTGNgKA,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"We've just discovered two new awesome dishes at Szechwan Palace -  the cumin covered lamb riblets on the Chinese menu as well as the Water Boiled Fish Filets on the regular menu.

The lamb riblets are coated with cumin and other spices, quick fried and then wok-fried with whole dried chilies, Szechwan numbing red peppercorns and caramelized onions.  This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills.

The Water Boiled dishes are a famous Szechwan classic which I don't know why I haven't ordered until today.  The plain name is quite misleading.  It's a clear soup boiled with an insane amount of chilies, more numbing peppercorns, Napa cabbage, a little celery, fermented beans and garnished with sprigs of coriander.  You have choice of meat and we chose fish today.  The filets are coated with cornstarch and quickfried to preserve it's moisture and tenderness before adding to the stew.  This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far.  I think I'm hooked.

Let me stress that this restaurant excels at authentic Szechwan food, not American-style Chinese dishes or even Cantonese dishes.  Although the xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup buns) were surprisingly good.  I wonder if they share some dishes with the Shanghainese restaurant on the other side of Ranch Market, which was extremely quiet in contrast to Szechwan Palace which was packed with a weekday office lunch crowd."

With only 1 other table occupied, the waitress staunchly refused to seat me until my entire party arrives --- in this case, the 2 other people that would double the current occupancy level of the restaurant.

I am getting an inkling that this may not be the pleasant dinning experience that I was hoping for.  After 10 minutes of cooling my heels on the hot asphalt lot, my wayward friends arrived and we were granted permission to sit.

The menu had odd notes of randomness...Chicken Cordon Bleu...really?  We ended up ordering New Mexico Sausages, Carne Asovada and the Relleno Platter.  The sausages were the best of the lot.  While the relleno was decent, it wasn't anything worth walking the hot parking lot for.  As for the Carne Asovada, the flavoring was so subtle that we couldn't actually taste any...ended up asking for chile sauce.  It took some effort to flag down the waitress since the occupancy level doubled yet again (meaning there is now ~ 10 customers in the restaurant)...but finally, the waitress got us 2 house-made sauces in tiny bowls.  The sauces were okay and did improve the flavor the pork (especially since it was completely bland before)...but any remaining iota of good will from this better-late-than-never gesture was completely banished when we got the bill and realized that we were charged for each of these 2 additional sauces.

Did the so-call cool quotient or the slightly above average food made up for the service?  I don't think so.  But hey if you're feeling masochistic and want to pay to be treated badly then head on over to Richardson.

I enjoyed the usual Vietnamese favorites of spring rolls and pho.  While the grilled pork on broken rice was nicely flavored, the meat was a touch on the dry side.

My favorite is the pickled papaya with charcoal grilled pork and meatball.  It's served with rice noodles, lettuce and fresh herbs.  The charred savory meat is nicely balanced by the sweet and sour papaya.  The rice noodles are great for absorbing the tasty broth.

Last night, we had the honor of being invited to their first preview hosted by FBR.  As we walked in through the foyer flanked by floor to ceiling rows of glorious wine, we got a glimpse of chef Mina autographing his cookbook for a guest but that was the last we saw of him.  The space has a very masculine NY monochromatic decor befitting a steakhouse.

Prior to dinner, we were offered kobe sliders, which were a bit messy as finger food and looked better than they tasted.  Servers also offered us a choice of sauv blanc or the 2003 Silver Oak Cab.

As we pondered over the menu, a trio of duck fat fries with a trio of sauces and focaccia in a large cast iron pan were brought to our table.  Honestly, I could not taste the difference with the duck fat but the truffle cream sauce was very good.  The focaccia would have benefited from more olive oil and herbs.

First course was the bibb wedge salad - three wedges of the lettuce served on a bed of avocado puree and topped with Oregon smokey blue cheese and bacon bits.  The bibb lettuce was sweet and crisp contrasting nicely with the intensity of the savory blue cheese.  The avocado didn't contribute much except to hold the wedges in their place.

For mains, we were offered a choice of wood-grilled chicken, miso-glazed black cod, and all-natural filet mignon.  All were served with foraged mushrooms, truffled mac & cheese (oddly with bits of broccoli florets) and creamed spinach.

Btw, what does all-natural mean?  As opposed to part artificial elsewhere?  And while I'm at it, did the captain really have to explain that foraged means wild?

Nobody at our table ordered chicken so I can't comment on it.  The filet mignon was of course tender and surprisingly flavorful given the cut - it was probably slow-cooked at a low temperature and then quickly seared on the grill to give it the nice crust.    The cod, a classic Japanese preparation made popular by Nobu, was the most moist and flaky version I've ever tasted.  Unfortunately the heavy sides did not pair as well with the fish as they did with the steak.

The forager of the mushrooms will be disappointed to hear that their hard work was wasted.  The mushrooms were undercooked - still containing a lot of their moisture and acidity.

Three other sides were brought in cast iron pans to the table for sharing - marble potatoes Lyonnaise (baby black and white potatoes with caramelized onions - delicious), sour cream & onion potato puree (this was way too wet - almost soupy), and glazed baby carrots.

Everyone at the table found the food to be overly salted, probably compounded by the heaviness of each side.  Feeling a bit laden, we hoped for some brighter tastes in our dessert.

Alas it was not to be.  Beignets, churros and doughnuts:  I challenge you to find a heavier combination.
- The beignets were served with a trio of pot de creme - vanilla creme brulee, chocolate and the highlight an 18-yr Macallan butterscotch.
- The citrus churros were served with a shot of Mexican spiced hot chocolate.
- The doughnuts with half a caramelized banana and cinnamon ice cream.

The doughy fried concoctions would probably have been delicious on their own but all together they were too alike.  The ice cream flavored with ground cinnamon was gritty and overpowering.  Would have been much better if they had used cinnamon sticks to flavor their mix and strained it out before churning.

Bourbon Steak still has a quite a few kinks to work out before their opening in less than 2 weeks.  With almost $7 million invested, I have no doubt that they will deserve 5 stars when that happens."

There are more choices for drinks than there are for food, hence the name Tearoom.  All teas and coffees are served in french presses with an egg timer so you get the perfect brew.  You get the choice of soy, rice or almond milk and a wide range of sweeteners.

The blue corn griddle cakes served with maple syrup and blueberries was full of fibery goodness.

We also had a spelt foccacia sandwich filled with an artichoke-garlic spread, spinach and shredded carrots.  The salty miso soup helped balance the blandness of the sandwich.

Healthy doesn't necessarily mean bland.  I've had some great raw vegan meals in NYC where they use lots of herbs and spices to make up for less salt.  Mandala could be great with an injection or two of creativity."
LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"Given the scarcity of good ethnic options in the North Scottsdale area, Indian Paradise deserves another star.  We've been on an ethnic binge this week and decided to check out the buffet lunch again.

The garlic naan was brought hot to the table and refilled when our basket went empty.  It had a great crispy charred exterior.  The tandoori chicken tasted brined which probably contributed to the tenderness.  Pretty good selection of veg options like veg korma (mild creamy sauce), dal makhani (lentils), chana masala (chickpeas) and saag (spinach) with potatoes.

All in all a great value and we look forward to coming back for the weekend champagne brunch which is priced at $11.95 and includes one drink.  Buffet offering is also supposed to be more extensive.

Don't forget to grab a bag of crispy spiced snacks on the way out.  They're better than chips and very addictive."

Unfortunately we were disappointed.  Neither dishes were as fiery and complex in flavor as the first time.  We ordered beef with both again and the beef was not as moist and tender as previously.

However even though they were not 5 star dishes, they were still much better than most Thai meals we've had in the Valley."
emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,1,"After reading all the reviews here about C-Fu Gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley, I am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the area

Was the service rude and uncaring? The answer here is yes.  Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.

But all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food.

Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):

-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that ""they probably forgot"" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.

-  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.

Dishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):

-  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil

-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable?  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievable

On a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.

Next time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on."
btNOTgFB8RNVTfLjtTYMDQ,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"While the food at Sol Y Sombra wasn't complicated, it was certainly yummy and the service was (surprisingly given the cool vibe and the beautiful people -- I mean the staff not just the customers) totally relaxed and friendly.

There we were schlepping in with our shorts and t-shirt...and without a reservation at that.   No attitude from the hostess.  Though the place was fully booked, we were happy with our bar seats...easy access to their yummy mojito and sangria..and the tapas started flowing.

On my  to be repeated list were the baby back ribs (for the sweet/tart quince and sprinkle of pimenton), the asparagus with crab (loved loved the romesco sauce) and the trout with sprinkle of hazelnut and salsa verde

Everything else (calamari, pan fried potatoes, brussel sprouts, mussels in tomato broth) were all solid.

oZcbn7ENit23xbCsyu9xbA,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,5,"I agree with the other reviews, Yasu serves some of the best Japanese food in Phoenix.  The formula of fresh high quality ingredients, authentic preparation, artful presentation, modern yet unpretentious decor, friendly service and reasonable prices is destined for success.

Having spoiled my taste buds in Tokyo eating sushi every week for 5 months at Tsukiji, the world's biggest fish market, it's been hard to find satisfying sushi, especially in Phoenix.

I was delighted to see fishes imported from Japan on the menu, like spanish mackerel (aji) which I've seen only at the best sushi restaurants.  We order it as sashimi - the slices were presented next to the bones of the fish (head to tail intact) with ginger and chopped green onions.  The fish was fresh and full of flavor.

After we finished the dish, the waiter took the bones back to be deep-fried.  This is as authentic as it gets - the Japanese waste nothing.  If you can get past your squirmishness of eating fish brains, this is the ultimate crunchy treat.

Unfortunately, ankimo (monkfish liver) - one of my favorite raw dishes - creamy without being fishy served traditionally with ponzu sauce - was out that day.  We had the succulent kumamoto oysters, which were also served with ponzu, instead.

The grilled yellowtail (hamachi) filet and collar (hamachi kama) were both perfect - grilled patiently over oak charcoals until the exterior was wonderfully crispy while the interior stayed deliciously moist.  I generally prefer hamachi kama because it's oiler and more tender but the presentation of the filet was quite dramatic - long plate with fried root chips on one end and ponzu sauce with grated radish on the other.

Grilling like this does take time so be prepared to wait 20-30 min for this dish.  Quicker grilled dishes include the giant scallops wrapped in bacon and tasty lamb chops.  We also ordered the beef tongue but somehow the waiter never entered it in.

We also ordered a childhood favorite: cornflake shrimp - jumbo sized shrimp rolled in cornflakes and deepfried, served with a homemade tartar sauce.

We loved the variety on the menu and can't wait to go back to try more dishes, esp the ankimo and grilled tongue."
3-6biVwm7VwPZ-k67jml-Q,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"I forgot where I was for a moment when I stepped into Andreoli.  How did I end up in a cafe reminscent of the ones I lingered over vino at in Tuscany?

I was surrounded by wooden antique shelves filled with Italian dry pastas, olive oils and mini jam jars.  The long deli case is filled with all kinds of meats, cheeses and homemade pastries.

The menu (available on website) is comprised of panini, antipasti (calamari, pizzas) and salads.  You order at the deli counter and if you're eating in, they bring the food to you and on real plates.  We ordered one thing from each section:

- bresaola con ruchetta e parmigiano: thin-sliced air-cured beef on an arugula salad and shaved parmesan  $6.50

- panino di tizio: grilled homemade sausage, bell peppers and onions in a toasted baguette  $7.50

- le palle del papa: baked breaded rice balls filled with meat sauce, parmesan and peas  $5.00

- sfogliatelle: shell-shaped multi-layered pastry filled with homemade ricotta  $2.75

The sausage and air-cured beef were delizioso!  The rice ball was the size of a baseball and packed with tasty fillings.  My only complaint was that the arugula salad contained hardly any arugula, but that's not going to stop me from coming back to try the daily pasta specials.

Can't handle the hefty airfare and expensive Euro?  This is the next best thing!  Molto bene!"

Solid rendition of gyros and falafel...but the sublime baklava is what will be drawing me back to Yusef...just the right amount of sweetness and a light touch with the rose water.

SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"Super Dragon's main menu is filled with Americanized Chinese food which I ignored as soon as I saw the single page laminated menu in pure Chinese.  The two dishes we ordered were delicious and reminded me of food cooked at my grandma's house in Hong Kong.

The Chinese menu is filled mainly with Cantonese food except for the obligatory Peking duck.  We ordered the bitter melon stir-fried with 3 kinds of diced eggs (salted duck eggs, preserved eggs and regular eggs).  The hints of bitterness nicely balanced the creaminess of the preserved eggs and savoriness of the salted eggs.

The weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot.  We ordered the mixed veg with dried shrimp and vermicelli (aka mung bean thread) in hotpot.  What came instead of the vermicelli was black moss and the addition of tofu, which was not mentioned.  We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient.  The flavors were spot on, well-balanced and very comforting.

I'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu.  I need to find out the name so that I can order it again.

It's a shame that Super Dragon doesn't offer the authentic Chinese menu in English as well."

I don't know if it was because I was starving after a long day at work or that their food has genuinely improved, but the food tasted alright to me.  Maybe more than alright.  The hash browns were nice and crispy on the surface and it was great how everything stayed piping hot on the hot plate they served it on.

Service was friendly and professional.  How can you beat the price especially late at night when nothing else in the area is open?"

This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures.

Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time.

Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday."
SN5r_mlySBoAGVzXD6K0qA,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"I think grand is a word I'll be using over and over to describe the decor of Amarone.  It looks nothing remotely like Pizza a Metro.  From the gates through which you enter the restaurant, to the enormous round marble bar which has lights shining up through it, to the giant chandeliers, it seems that the recession has not hit this part of Scottsdale.

The grandeur seems out of place in this tired strip mall with its bowling alley and assortment of small businesses.  But once you're inside, you feel like you're in a different world - somewhere between a restaurant in NYC's Little Italy and a swanky hotel bar.

Maurizio and his friendly team were gracious enough to seat us even though we arrived past 10pm on a weeknight (kitchen closes at 10pm).  The fresh out-of-the-oven pita-like bread that Metro is so known for hit our table first with a side of caramelized onions and other aromatics.  We really liked the light coating of olive oil and salt on the warm thin bread.  Then came our order:

Stuffed Mushrooms $10 - shrooms stuffed with sausage, ricotta, parmesan in a lemon garlic veal stock reduction:  lots of flavor although the stuffing tasted a bit too much like liver for one of us

Shrimp Scampi $11- half dozen large butterflied shrimp in a lemon butter white wine sauce:  the shrimp were huge but unfortunately lacked flavor

Homemade Gnocchi  $14 - in a tomato sauce with cubes of mozz and basil: the light and airy gnocchi was definitely our fave

I found the sauces on my two apps a bit unbalanced and the plating old-fashioned.  It seems that the dishes that Metro are known for are still the stars here.  Given how large the menu is, I really need to come back and try a few of the 16 pastas ($14-$23) and 17 mains ($18-$28) before I can give a real verdict.

Get the word out: Amarone is open for business!"
szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"After having eaten at Golden Buddha, China King, C-Fu, and China Chan, I have to say that Great Wall is probably the best place to get dimsum in the Valley.   China Chan comes a close second with better har gau and egg tarts.

The Chinese New Year special dimsum - pig trotters with black moss - was delicious.  Apparently it's super labor intensive so is only offered for a limited time.  The shiu mai, steamed tripe and spare ribs were cooked and seasoned just right.  The taro puff had great taro flavor and tasty filling with only a hint of oil.

The har gau skin unfortunately fell apart and the egg tart crust was not as flaky as China Chan's.  Overall, the flavors were good, fresh and a nice variety to choose from."
rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"Solid neighborhood place serving good old school Chinese food in generous portions and with a surprisingly high level of service.

Here it's all about the Mu Shu and the sizzling platters.  Flamingo Palace still provides old fashion table side service where the waitress plates the black pepper beef onto the hot cast iron platter right next you so you can see the steam and hear the dish sizzle.  The mu shu is also wrapped table side.

Don't let the obscure corner location deter you.  The interior is much nicer (though a little worn) than the outside might suggest.

Extra star for the service."
WSmOu-JNHfVxvisIWAvL9Q,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,5,"(Updated 10/25/07) We need a 6th star for this place.  Forget about Capital Grill, this is the place to go if you call yourself a foodie or want to be one.

The tasting menu at Binkley's is the way to go.  It starts off at $60 for 4 courses, $65-72 for 5 courses and $77 for 6 courses.  A steal, I tell you, compared to French Laundry's (where Kevin Binkley used to work) $200+ tasting menu and it's almost just as good plus you get to pick your dishes and you don't have to deal with 2 month advance reservations.  The drive to Cave Creek is so worth it!

Even more amazing is that they give you a ton of really creative amuse bouche (little morsels to amuse your mouth) before your first course even hits the table and then more throughout the meal.  We got at least ten tonight.  What a deal!  Just to give you an idea of the amuse bouche craziness, this is some of what we got in the last two meals (check out the pixs above if you wanna see what tasty looks like):
- parsnip soup
- baby zucchini with organic tomato-caper relish
- tomato water with sriracha jelly & celery salt (on strobe light)
- romeseco with Parmesan foam & eggplant chips
- house pulled mozzarella with golden raisins & almond
- sausage with artichoke chip
- green apple sorbet & grapefruit sorbet
- puffed wild rice crispy treat

Wine pairing is available and highly recommended.  Dan the sommelier is super cool and used to be a humanitarian photographer traveling all over 3rd world countries.  The staff here have really interesting backgrounds and manage to strike the balance between being professional and friendly.

Make sure to ask for the tasty potato chips (usually just served at the bar). If you can imagine those colorful Terra Chips reaching ""be all that they can be"" level of goodness, then you'd know what I mean.

Menu changes daily to keep with seasonality and what's fresh.  Hope they keep the divine Burgundy Truffle Pumpkin Agnolotti for a little longer so that I can have it at least one more time."
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"I wouldn't have been able to find Lo-Lo's without GPS...but now that I have, I'll definitely be going back.

The southern fried chicken was crunchy, tasty, finger lickin' good (take that KFC)...and the thin buttery waffle also had a nice crisp edge, although next time I'm gonna try for extra crispy waffles...the mac & cheese was velvety smooth & rich...my first bite of rice & beans was an epiphany - the savory sauce was a perfect contrast against the sweetness of the waffles and crusty corn muffin - I now know that I have never truly had rice and beans before Lo-Lo's.

But my favorite was actually the fried catfish...dusted with cornmeal for a dry (not oily) crunch into oh-so tender flaky catfish.  I would have loved to order another one, but I was bursting.  However, as I went up to pay, I could not help but notice that luscious hunk of Red Velvet cake slathered with cream cheese frosting and studded with walnut...I gave into the siren call and ordered a piece to take home.  Unfortunately, the cake turned out to be a bit of a letdown despite being plenty moist - no taste of chocolate to be found and the icing was a tad thin.

The other thing I didn't like was the coffee, which was kind of watery...but hey that's kinda authentic too.

The waitress was friendly and attentive.  When we told her that our eggs still had not hit the table even though we were almost done with the rest of the food, she offered us a choice of any side to take home.   This kind of service is rare and is also why I want to go back."

The servers were a bit overwhelmed by the lunch rush (it was later explained to me that one did not show up for work).  The room's large and comfy.

We ordered the Santa Fe where you get to choose uno or dos items out of a selection of enchiladas, tacos, burros, tamales, etc. - we picked the carne adovado and lobster tamale ($9.50 plus ""Up Charge"" of $1.50 for the lobster).  And also the Soup and Salad: Posole and Adobe Salad.

Verdict:
4 stars: Lobster Tamale - generously filled with large chunks of lobster
3 stars: Adobe Salad - plain solid
2 stars: Carne Adovado - pork itself is quite bland and the sauce tastes like the adobo sauce I get from a can
2 stars: Posole - bland especially after having the complimentary chips and spicy salsa

If all we had ordered was the Lobster Tamale, this could've been 5 stars.

It's located in the Scottsdale Airpark area in the same center as Indian Paradise.  The room is relatively nice, service is friendly, prices are very reasonable and most shocking of all, the food is authentic and very good - it's almost too good to be true.

We had the special pho (rice noodles in beef broth with thin-sliced beef, tripe and meatballs) and banh xeo (giant crepe filled with a mix of meat and beansprouts).

The pho's broth was sweet, clean and complex - tasted like it was made with a generous amount of beef bones cooked for a long time over low heat - no hint of any artificial flavoring.  It was so good that I finished all the soup - that's never happened at Da Vang.

The banh xeo comprised of a large crepe made with rice flour filled with beansprouts, pork, shrimp and herbs.  It's served with leaves of iceberg lettuce and the classic nuoc cham dipping sauce.  This is probably one of the best-executed banh xeo I've had - the crepe was very thin and crispy.  The filling was on the bland side but the dipping sauce made up for it.

We can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu, including the banh mi (Vietnamese-French sandwiches)."

Finally got my food; Chorizo & Eggs w/side of tortillas. What?! Out of tortillas? Instead Hawaiian sweet bread? Where is the salsa? What?! Don't serve salsa? Tried a piece of their ""famous"" chicken; it's nothing to write home about. For the money, I would get a bucket of KFC, be more satisfied and have leftovers. May be in a few months they'll catch their ""groove"". Until then, I will try other venues along Gilbert Road before returning to  ""Locos"" chicken and waffles."
IWOQNyRqWrnqQA5K49eK5g,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,2,"Waited to be seated 40 minutes on a Sunday night. Then another 55 minutes for my food. The restaurant closed before I got my food. Expensive, spicy (even the mild) condiments. Staff is friendly but have no clue as to when the food will be delivered to our table. Not going back anytime soon."
JU2K7-ZmLZWc43ASTs7T1Q,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,2,Cold food. Reheated. Still cold. Will go elsewhere for wings. Save yourself from  a bad experience. Management should fire the cooks.
dwNZks_N6paJzgU4zzwlWw,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,1,"Disappointed - even though I repeated my order 3 times, it was delivered incorrectly. Sides too small for the price. Chicken was over cooked and dry. Over ran by large staff: confusion and disorganization."
7tdVsSDXRKtLLC-fD1hJ-A,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,2,Today was terrible. I blame the manager. Our server was doing double duty: server and bar tender. The food was slow and the service even slower. May or may not come back for awhile .
-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,3,"Trendy. Expensive. Loud. Tuesdays is your best bet because beef tacos are a couple of dollars versus typical prices any other day. Everything else in the menu is pricy but good. Not family oriented, unless you like to be screaming at your kids."
pa-C-Vsk9ntuXBGjTr0tBQ,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,2,"Time to clean up the cobwebs and the smell. It  needs a through cleaning. As for the croissants, a croissant is a buttery, flaky, Vienna?style pastry. The croissants here are gummy and chewy."
R68SX1-FFLvv6BqsK9-Alw,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,2,"First time, not impressed. Seating is mostly outdoors and with the weather these days not comfortable at all. Water drips on you and your food from the misters. Food is good, but not expectacular for the  prices; chips n salsa are extra. Overall it lacks ambiance and the manger needs to put a smile even during cahos. Orders get mixed up, too many hands taking food to tables."
B8ym13fwCHn4UdrHe-MUPw,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,3,"I was there on a Sunday for lunch. You will miss the location if you are not paying attention. The place not very attractive, but it is not a dump either. It has a dining area and a ""store"" with minimal products and souvenirs. My lunch was served on a metal tray (shaped in the form of a pig?), not very attractive. Lunch was a flank steak, tough for a super-thin piece of meat, a fried egg on top (poorly done), small salad, and two large potato chips (not fries) that were over cooked. My friend had the chicken with rice, it looked much more appetizing. What was good were the empanadas, which tasted very similar to Indian samosas. The attention was good, but Spanish only. For the service, location, and quality, the prices are too high. There are other latin restaurants in the area, I will try them first before going back to this one."
6Cl15LapBVhw4ZfBIeVJJA,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,3,"Three stars for service. If you know about med- or middle-eastern food then you don't want to eat here. Presentation is poor, fast food quality (dry, over cooked), quantity does not match price ($8 hummus can buy a whole tub, here you get 4 table spoons, may be). True Mediterraneans or middle-easteners know that there is no choice between salad or Naan, it's both with dinner. Not here. Side salad was served in a saucer,  lettuce and cucumbers, lots of cucumbers. The Naan was crusty and burned. Ice tea? Super light version, water would have been a better choice. Place was empty another sign of caution. I was lured to this place after watching the video on their website. I did not realize it was done long time ago, when it opened, it looked good then."
j-SSlq3__BQr3H7lAyVvkw,RLk_nNUXhhsnAwfqyhfOJA,3,This location is ample and service is good. However their pizza doesn't compare to the original. If you like Nello's try the one on Alma School.
Ly2ShApiomYZwKehwb7eRA,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,3,Well above average neighborhood sushi joint.  I have had very nice quality fish here.  But potion can sometime be a bit on the small side.
0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,3,"This place wasn't quite up to scratch for me.

I had the foie gras sandwich.  It was pretty good, but I was still ravenous $10 later, so I top it off with a chocolate croissant ($2.75) which was also good.

Definitely a cute space with above average dishes.  But in the end there just wasn't enough bangs for my bucks."
HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,2,"May be I went on a bad day for the kitchen, but the dishes I had was well below the average touristy level.

- the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned
- the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato, half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef
- the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy (no, not in a good way)
- the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be better

La Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot.  But it looks like I'll have to keep on passing on by."
DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,4,"The sushi bar here just rock.  Second and third visit to  Sushi Roku, P made a bee line for the sushi bar.  That made all the difference.

First time here we sat at a booth and while the food was good, there wasn't anything to make me want to go out of my way to come back.

But the sushi bar just transform the experience.  The sushi chefs are friendly and willing to engage you and what's fresh and good.   I put my trust and their recommendation and left happy and satisfied."
FI-8LPGkc8D_hwx0l0zyyg,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,4,"Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.
Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list."
9GPWnFfwL3teZFax-CPD_A,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,2,The long line at CPK for a weekend dinner is testament to the triumph  of good location over mediocre food and not very good service by the  frazzled staff.

John P's review said it all.  My lunch was institutional and canned tasting.  The ""real"" mash potato tasted like it could have been fake with a slick & sticky texture.
May be breakfast would have been better."
peH054eonSBTLLC5aFOQ0g,giVnJkgVJ_5WeAPPIQ6fCw,3,"Good place for bagels.   My personal fav is with everything.

The sandwiches are huge, I could only manage 1/2 and had to save the rest for later.   Not cheap, but you do get what you paid for.

While I haven't yet to find something totally amazing there, I love that they're not a chain."
WmHRxbW3m8cngS4e6T8Cnw,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,3,"We waited 45 minutes for our food. Not god because we were in a rush!
Once the food finally got to us I was impressed by the food presentation. It wasnt just thrown on the late. My peppercorn encrusted pork loin was sliced and fanned and placed a top special red onions laddened with green beans and scallopped potatoes.
we went here because we saw a coupon in val pak.  THEY ADD TIP WITH THIS COUPON. the coupon says skillfuly preparred so i guess thats the warning it takes awhile to cook the food. the food didnt appear to be microwaved or seated under a heat lamp . the food was just freshly hot!
my boyfriends fish and chips were just fish and chips. small piece of fish with shoe string FF . we ordered Ice tea to drink and you get a huge glass. so kudos there
plenty of seating in here. dark but nice looking for an irish pub tables and chairs hard hard wood uncmfortable. and if your a tall person sit at a high top.

But I wont be back. Service took to long. Male waiter was moody and grouchy. and i didnt feel comfortable."

Pasta sauce is no different from store bought.

It should shut down the kitchen,and,just turn,the place,onto a museum"

A Tuscan pizza and added sausage. We ordered it crispy when i go there the woman was concerned she over cooked the pizza and already had another one cooking in the oven! But i liked the one she had ready to go.  I almost walked out without my salads but she ran after me and made aure i got them.
The blonde haired older woman was berry polite ready an willing to please
The place was clean
My order was correct
I am now full and happy."
h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,4,I love this place. It so cool that you can drink and eat be waited on while watching a movie. The seats are comfortable and if you want to talk and eat they have plenty of seating around the bar to enjoy before your movie

Great service for being busy. I liked our smoothie and our hot meals but the muffin I got wasnt the best. good coffee and love the decor. and for as packed as it was it was quiet."

But both locations greeted me at the door ready to answer questions and make suggests. Both places were quick. Both places give you a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert.

With their pick two combos a drink doesn't come with it. But you do get nice portions for the price of just two items. And if you do get a drink they have a drink station with another  menu to make your own non alcoholic mixed drinks. Made with those flavored syrups like they put in. Your coffee.
They have wifi here but we couldn't log on.

I will come back someday."
QvHybsk5_SnyEMD15izeeQ,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,3,"the server over charge and double charged my card.
so im never going back.
the hummus plate was really good but the pita bread seemed stale.
the calamri was really good with a spicy dipping sauce.
the tortilla soup tasted homemade. really delicious.
but server partrick seemed aloof and ruined my christmas shipping  budget"

Definetly my fav place now"

I was greeted as I walked in every employee i encountered was polite and smilig. they were busy and the noise was pretty high. I ws concerned about the portions being outrageous but they were perfect
and you get a chocolate dipped strawberry with yur meal! I also had a very good dessert beautifully created. But remember this is like a fast food deli its not like an mastro kitchen for dinner but for a deli its clean, organized.
they have a place to charge cel phones and get wifi. the drink bar is hiding ehind the big ipod charging station.
My sandwhich ws perfect, warm all the way through and no mustard just like I asked. I got the baked ham sandwhich. Delicious! and nice views out the windowfor people watching.
One is coming to desert ridge market place soon!"
0nyM_mub7LxN6Dx7tYpMaA,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,4,"Before I even took my seat outside I was greeted with a menu and silverware. And before i even opened the menu i got ice water and so did my dog! Who joined me for lunch on the patio. The interior was very inviting with it's shades of green, and A/C. But I choose outside on green furniture. Not just patio furniture but wooden chairs and good tables. But if my shirt was any thinner I would have splinters in my back. The wooden chairs are worn from the weather outside.

I placed my order for the golden soy chicken delight. It was delicious. Chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside a perfect portion or excellently cooked veggies. Broccoli, squash, peppers, and cauliflower. And my choice of jasmine or brown rice chose jasmine and it was good.
Dessert and mint flavored drinks were tempting but I just had my meal and water and walked out for under twelve bucks.
The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of five was the splintery chairs and patio floor needs to be pressure washed."
JR2ma-JU1CO_xVD_p5-RPw,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,2,"There is one in Laughlin on the water where the seagulls bother you. I prefer that over being bothered by a waitress who waits till my glass is bone dry before refilling it.

I guess I should have ordered crab since I was at a crab house but I didnt I ordered a shrimp platter. It seemed bland. not enugh coconut on the coconut shrimp, the beer battered shrimp weren't crispy enough and the diping sauces where in paper cups??? weird wasnt expecting that. This is a place to have a beer and sit at the bar not to eat"
_E6j0AVb3lkLBLzvPHInXA,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,4,"It was busy today. But everyone seemed happy and not waiting to long.

My to go order was quick. My sweet potato fries crispy and sweet and just enough salt. My mushroom Swiss grilled chicken sandwich very moist but it made the bun soggy.

The place is small and cramped when full. There is indoor and outdoor seating. But once your in line you are boxed in. The is a wall o. One side a half a wall on the other and people in front and behind you. So ink twice before stepping into line.
When you place your order they have a cool digital screen that lays out the order for you and you swipe your Credit card on the side of e screen when prompted .

I'm going back!"
C1zlvNlxlGZB8g0162QslQ,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,3,"No room for Rhythm or Wine @ Rhythm & Wine. This cramped but crazy cute bar/ restaurant has good food but bad service. The food tastes good but presentation lacks. When I ordered the bruschetta plate my first mental words were,   ""Really?"" It tasted just like the menu described. However it was served on a wooden cutting board and it looked like someone was in mid sandwich making progress and said here I give up. Maybe a different plate or a garnish to distract you from the simple looking slices of bread would have been nice. In this appetizer you can choose from four delicious bread topping options.  I was impressed with the 3 I choose they were all paired well with the ingredients listed.  After waiting what felt like 20 minutes for that plates of food I scarfed it down and impatiently waited for my next plate choice, the sliders.
Slowly sipping on my ""blondes have more fun"" flight of wine I watched the sun set as my sliders approached. The burgers themselves could have been pictured in a magazine but then there were toasted grated potato pieces and sweet potato fries in the middle, so much going on you wouldn't know where to begin, so I took a few moments and overlooked everything. Sweet potato fries, hash brown or grated potatoes cooked well. Ketchup, mayo, 3 mini burgers with cheese and 3 slices of tiny tomato 3 slices of tiny pickles for your little hamburgers. After my first appetizer I was already satisfied but dug into this next plate anyways.  2 burgers and fries and more wine I was stuffed but polished off the third burger anyways because it was still hot and juicy and the bun was still crisp not soggy
After a few minutes of settling the stomach I order crème bulee maybe service got better because they knew I was leaving but towards the end my water glass never went dry and my dessert was there before I could finish the thought of dessert.  That's the kind of service I like and wanted the entire meal but didn't get till the end. And believe it or not it took the whole staff to provide me with that end of dinning excellent experience! Yep the whole staff.
The advertisement I saw in the mail said Beatles and bottles night on Wednesday. Well I went on Wednesday  4-18-12 and there was no Beatles but plenty of bottles so many bottles in fact that each corner had boxes of wine and not to neatly or artistically arranged but just cluttered in the corner, like behind the hostess stand and next to the bathrooms.  (get a room, a storage room for your extra stock.)
The place is cramped and suggests a dance opportunity but offers no room for it. The bar is horse shoe shaped and around the bar is a sling of tables and chairs offering the crew an oblique muscle workout as they twist and turn between the tight tight maze to make it to their destination. Like the patio, which was closed this night for private party. It would be nice to have the patio extended around the building back towards the front door or just have a bigger patio so when the weather is great we can all enjoy it."

I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food.

I had great service on a thursday night and a good salad But i did not like my hamburger at all.

The outdoor seating area is roomy and big. Which is grat since phx has great weather for outdoor dinng.

It is a bit pricey for what you get however - I am not a big eater, and I ate the lettuce wraps and pizza on my own without feeling that full. It's nice to feel good after the meal, but I wish the prices were slightly cheaper. Maybe it's to cover the costs of the better ingredients?"

Everything we ate was delicious and fresh and very carefully prepared. Loved the complimentary flourless chocolate cake at the end. Yum!

If that wasn't bad enough, I ended getting FOOD POISONING from this place! When I called to let them know about it the next day, the hostess brushed it off and said that they never have gotten any complaints about food poisoning before. She didn't offer me anything; she didn't apologize.

I already would never have returned to Sushi Brokers after the meal, but after realizing that this place gave me food poisoning, and after they were so nonchalant about it, I don't ever want to see or think of this place again!"

Our main issues are: 1. The food was somewhat overpriced. They had a few items that were inexpensive ($5 items, and the California rolls are just $5). Some of the rolls were way too expensive though, and the tempura was also pretty pricey. 2. We were there in a group - some of our food came out extremely fast, and some came out very slowly. It made it a bit awkward when we finally had to eat because our food was going to get cold.

All in all, we would return, but at those prices, we would probably wait until we are really craving sushi. It is definitely one of the better sushi places we have eaten at in Phoenix though."
YjAo1DBb0YuPE_RWmhNyrA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"This place is just okay. The food was decent, but it is overpriced for what you get. Also, our server was not very attentive at all. It was a busy night, but he hardly came to our table, and when he was there, it was obvious that he did not want to be there."
h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"I would probably give this place 3.5 stars.

I am rounding up to 4 stars because the prices are much more reasonable that other ""dinner movie theaters."" Also, the service is friendly and fast, and the menu options are pretty good. The food also seems a bit cheaper than other similar places.

The food however isn't amazing. It seems to be slightly better than other places we have been to, and they are somewhat generous with their portions. While some of the seating is more normal, regular chairs, there are also seating options that are office chairs. They are comfortable ones, but at times it can be a bit awkward when you swivel into your neighbor or try to get comfortable.

I will continue to go here though for this type of experience, as the prices are so reasonable. It's also very clean!"

We have been trying to eat healthy lately, and this place was just perfect for that. The consistency of the mock chicken dishes was almost perfect, and we weren't left with that sick, full feeling in our stomachs. Wish this place was closer to where we live!"
Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"We had the waffles, and they were delicious with the caramel banana topping! We also had the potato pancakes, and they were decent. I wish they were a little more crispy.

Our waitress split the bill before we even had to ask, which was nice. But she never asked if we wanted to order anything more. We were a bit hungry and were thinking of ordering more.

They need more vegetarian lunch options.

All in all, it was pretty good. We might return if we are in the mood for brunch with friends."

- Fontina burger
- French fries
- Onion rings
- Fried zucchini
- BBQ chicken salad

...and everything was fabulous! We will definitely be returning when we are in the area."
_DPJ_PHJnXsuhYhsgBA0Xw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"The food was very good! We got the smaller filet mignon with mashed potatoes and the shrimp scampi. Everything was prepared very well.

Our server wasn't very attentive after he found out we weren't ordering drinks. He didn't come by our table much and pretty much ignored us when we asked to turn the air conditioning down. It was very chilly in there!

I like how you enter through the kitchen. The ambiance of the place is nice too.

We would return but only for a nice occasion. It was a bit pricey!"

Second time review: Decent service, although some of our orders took a while to come. Calamari appetizer was large and very good. The beet salad was delicious! Both of our meals were good, but they were a bit too creamy."

JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,Very good choices and portions from the lunch menu. Would return for a quick lunch if I'm in the mood for Thai close by. I would search elsewhere for a favorite Thai place though.
ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Delicious and fresh food, and great service!

The octopus in both of our meals was delicious. We both got seafood options, and they were great! We also ordered the donuts for dessert, and they were so tasty!

The portions aren't huge, but I guess it helps with not over-eating!

We will definitely return!"
ToFm2DhhTdr0Kv0A7Sdj6g,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very good food! We ordered a bunch of stuff for the 4 of us, and we were sufficiently full afterward. The price was good too!

The best part is the patio...very spread out, so you have your own space. It also has a great feel to it.

We will definitely be back!"

cTJjTKz2huGZ-ElScC2pSw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Nice and laid back! We enjoyed our food; it was very fresh.

I had the soup. I was told it was a black bean chili, but it seemed to be some sort of a tortilla soup. It was very spicy! I enjoyed it for a bit, but then it ended up being a little spicy for me overall.

The country vegetable chop salad was very good. My favorite part was the breaded brussel sprouts (a nice surprise!)."
cm5pya6toFXn6sJT4FVGyg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"We've been here multiple times now, but we stopped going a bit ago. I think we just thought that it was a bit grerasy? But I guess all Chinese can be greasy.

Good food and good prices. Would go back if I was craving Chinese."
Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"We came here to watch the sports game. There are plenty of TVs and a projector screen, which is great! Unfortunately, the projector wasn't showing the game very well, as too much light was coming in.

Yay for happy hour drink and appetizer specials everyday! The food was pretty good, especially for the price. I'd recommend coming here to watch a game or happy hour. You'll have a good time!"
flE7Sn2JGs0n3SAtaep6Zw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"This place was pretty good. Good food for the money - but it was definitely not one of my favorites. The atmosphere is only so-so too. You must make sure to get dressed up before coming here, which I don't mind, but I also am not always into that sort of scene.

I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could!"
uWYzS46xqA_YA1D1INgbEQ,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,4,"This place is great...provided that you are getting take out. First, the food is great and the portions are good sized. However, dining in here will make you feel as though you are unwanted. I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing, but there definitely isn't any effort to make you feel ""at home.""

All-in-all: Get take out, enjoy your food, and skip dining in. It's the food that brings you back."
P3ufH0wm0jvulnrinDpaAA,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,4,"Man, I love this place! Admittedly, it took a few minutes to get us seated given that we required a high-chair. However, once seated the staff got our kids tablets to play with. That was the last time my kids made any noise. They were so glued to the tablets that dining out was stress free! The wait service was great! I'm planning on coming back again real soon!

My only complaint was the initial issues with seating, as well as a sampling of one of the sauces. It did not taste the same when I got my actual order (way spicier!). Aside from that, I plan on returning for another good time!"
qJLMG55i5yVOIBgktZK5uA,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,2,"My family has been here a few times over the past few years. Essentially, every time we attempt to give this place ""another chance,"" we are sorely let down. Put simply, while the food is mediocre (i.e., nothing special), the service ruins this place. Our most recent trip resulted in a wait of 15 minutes before our drink/entree orders. While not too bad, the waiter never returned to refill our drinks. We didn't see her again until after we notified the gentleman that brought our food out that we needed refills. Essentially, she took our order and left - only to return to collect payment. It was a bad reminder as to why we avoid this place."
68O06rHoYy-7IH04I2OEXg,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"I live near here and have come around a few times for dinner. Overall, the pizza quality is great! Really great tasting pizza here in that New York style. The wings are decent, but aren't anything to brag about. However, no complaints there.

The inside of the restaurant is in need of a makeover. The inside has that ""run down"" feeling to it. Some of the chairs and tables need replaced/fixed. Additionally, the people at the counter aren't exactly the nicest. Every time I've been here, it's usually, ""What can I get you?"" I can't say I have ever made small talk with the counter help, which is rare given my outgoing nature. This usually leads to that awkward meal where you and a few friends eat, but feel uneasy about staying in the restaurant.

All-in-all: The food is great and is what will make you return; the price is above average (think Papa John's pricing); and the counter help could use a personality change."
JR2ma-JU1CO_xVD_p5-RPw,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"First, I must impress that I write this as a person who does not like seafood. However, my family does and I am obligated to travel with them. Get the point? Good.

Second, the location is extremely far from my home. It takes a good thirty (30) minutes to get here. Given that, the place does a great job in servicing its guests. Wait times are good and the attitudes of the servers are great.

Thirdly, I would recommend that they open the menu up to those that aren't seafood connoisseurs. Albeit a suggestion, please take it to heart as it would bring me here more ofter (rather than being dragged here).

Lastly, aside from my distaste of seafood (yeah, it's a trend here), the experience is great. The staff is great, the restaurant is great, and the overall experience is great. Aside from the lack of choice concerning the food, I really can't complain. I would recommend this place.

Additionally, the price is mediocre overall, but considering that lobster is not cheap, it is about average. But you do get a lot!"
93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,2,"Well, I am back to re-rate this place. Father's Day found me and the family out and about. Unfortunately, the service here was...well I am not sure it is considered service. We arrived and were given the option of waiting thirty (30) minutes or sitting outside. Opting for the outdoor seating, and given the heat, we expected a waiter that would at least make sure we had something to drink.

The service started out normal with drinks coming out fairly quickly; however, that was the end of the pleasantries. Again, with the heat, our drinks went rather quickly. Our empty glasses sat for roughly 10 minutes before our waiter (Vanessa) came back to refill them. Seated outside, we had no clue where our waiter was most of the time because we only saw her three times: 1) when she took our order, 2) when she refilled our drinks (for the first and only time), and 3) when she brought us the check. To make matters worse, the waiter helping the people across from us was doing an excellent job (i.e., refilling drinks, conversing, and checking on the quality of the food). It was like night and day between the waiters.

Overall, our waiter was either ready to clock out or just didn't care about us. Again, the food is good, but the service can be ridiculously bad. It was not a nice way to spend a Father's Day."
VsxfPc4kbDuvyP4HTsqRBQ,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"I have been here a few times. In short, it's am upscale burger place that has pretty decent customer service. The prices are a little high for burgers, but the food is good. I recommend this place if you are looking for something in-between a restaurant and a fast food joint. Additionally, the atmosphere is generally laid back regardless of the noise level."
WC94uZjbFJEHwiPL6y_d7g,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,1,"My buddy took me down here the other day to catch a game and have a few beers. Once our first pitcher was finished, we were out the door. Customer service lacks to the extent that I would have been better off getting my own beer and ringing myself up.

First, you are required to seat yourself (not really a big deal).

Second, the waitress we got (she has braces) asked what we'd like to drink. I ask, ""What do you have on tap?"" She replied, ""What are you looking for?"" I replied, ""Nothing in particular. I just want to know you have."" Her response, ""We have a lot of beer."" We settled on a pitcher of domestic instead of continuing with the rhetorical conversation.

Third, we couldn't decide on what food we wanted. The boneless wings come by the pound, so I asked about how many wings came in a basket. Apparently the answer is ""more than one."" When we decided we didn't want any food, this seemed to make the waitress even madder than she already appeared.

Lastly, after finishing our pitcher, we asked for the tab. The waitress (again she has braces) went and grabbed the ticket, placed it in the folder, and walked by our table and proceeded to toss it towards me without saying a word. It slid across the short end of the table and hit my glass (which luckily did not spill). I promptly placed my credit card in and waited for her to return, where I handed her the folder. Again, she ran the credit card, got the receipts, and threw the folder back across the table at me. There was no eye contact or any ""Thank you for stopping by"" comment to be had. She literally threw the folder with the receipt in it at me and walked away.

All-in-all: Service like this is the reason that people do not return. I gave Brookside a try and I will never be back. The customer service is about as rude as it gets. A smile or ""Thank you"" would do wonders for this place. My advice would be to skip this place entirely and hit up Buffalo Wild Wings."
kaQngr_Bykn49-FiM8W5xg,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,1,"First, I would have given this place zero (0) stars if possible. However, seeing as that is not the case, it gets one. The restaurant was remodeled and hardly recognizable once inside. The decor was great considering it is a Red Lobster. The compliments cease here.

When my family arrived, the greeter said nothing to us. She simply stood behind her station and looked at us. I took advantage of the delay so that my son could use the restroom. However, once we arrived out of the restroom, my fiance was still standing there waiting to be helped. I asked what was taking so long and the greeter said that she was waiting for someone to seat us. First impression was off to a great start, but I let it slide thinking that the restaurant was not prepared for the afternoon rush.

Once seated, the waitress took forever to get to us. Roughly fifteen (15) minutes passed before she returned to ask what we wanted to drink. By this time, we knew exactly what we wanted for the rest of our visit. About ten (10) minutes later, the waitress returned with our drinks, but somehow my fiance's drink was left at the bar. I am not even sure how this was the case considering it was a variety of iced tea. She said she would be right back with it...

My son, in the mean time, had to use the bathroom again. It took roughly ten (10) to fifteen (15) minutes for him to do his business. When we returned, the waitress was still M.I.A. About five (5) minutes later, she returned with our salads, but no drink for my fiance. To add insult to injury, the salad was warm. Furthermore, the waitress, upon being told that she left my fiance's drink at the bar, laughed and said, ""I'll get it in a minute.""

Following this, and noting that the other waitresses/waiters were tending to their guests, we promptly got up and walked out. This was a complete waste of our time (nearly an hour of waiting for food and over an hour total). This is only the second time I have walked out on a restaurant having eaten nothing. Obviously, I will not return."
dPGs5b0N9MarZjVgQVelGQ,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,4,"First, I can almost guarantee that you will not find better service in the Valley that tops The Cheesecake Factory. Every visit, every time; this place has it together.

The only reason it gets four (4) stars is due to the price. Taking my family out here and I am sure to get a bill topping one hundred bucks ($100) easily.

However, aside from price, the staff is great and I have never had an issue with any of the waiters/waitresses that work there. The food, albeit a wide variety of it, it always good (with the exception of a steak that I felt was a little dry).

If we are looking for a great place to eat and have a little extra cash to spend, this place gets our first looks."
Rud4J5Hsjn_jjU9IaQ0Dpw,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,4,"My fiancee and I came here for a nice night out. I'll admit that the food is pricey (and you do ""cook"" it yourself). However, the overall atmosphere and fun of the food made it worth while. The wait staff was good at keeping our glasses full, as well as recommending the various flavors. I would definitely come back here (provided I save up for it).

My only complaint: Price. While the night was great and we went home full, it did costs over $100.00 for the two of us. Provided you don't get dessert, you're looking at around $75.00 for a meal here.

On a side note: A few people complain that you cook your own food. Isn't that what fondue is about?"
cw0wVQxImxix2GoChgIYNQ,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,2,"A buddy of mine told me to skip this place, but I figured I would give it a try. The experience was nice in the sense that the wait staff clears your plates fairly quickly, as well as re-fills your drinks. However, the food was not fresh. Given that a good portion of it was seafood, it was a let down.

Also, the variety of food isn't so great as to consider it a ""World Buffet."" This place is a scaled down version of a typical Chines buffet. While most places are semi-decent in providing you with a large variety of food, this place is lacking.

All-in-all: The customer service is good and the place provides a nice quiet dining experience, but the lack of fresh seafood made it a waste of a trip. I was stuck getting the same food repeatedly until I was full. I would advise skipping this place and going to Panda Express for a better variety and freshness (which is saying something)."
g5HUA031z0xoNNZqMnGeYw,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"My wife brought me home a sandwich from here and it was delicious. So, on our trip out to Westgate to catch an early morning movie, we decided to stop by here and grab lunch. First, the food is great. It is a bit pricey (e.g., $10 a sub), but the quality is worth it. Second, my only complaint is the atmosphere of this place. I don't know if it was because the store had opened less than an hour before, but I did not feel welcome here. It was synonymous with, ""What do you want? Okay, get your food and go."" We had lunch in this place and if a pin needle fell, we'd all probably dive to the floor because of such a loud noise occurring. The workers here said nothing to anyone. Instead, they'd appear from the back of the place, walk across the lobby, and then return to the back without really doing anything.

All in all, the food is great, but you better get it to go. This place has a worse atmosphere than the morgue."
XNlUNm2dxhvaUu07b_Z_vQ,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,4,"First time I've been to a cracker barrel (that I can remember) and I actually enjoyed the place. Not a particular place that I would be likely to eat at on a regular basis, but it was a good visit. The food was cheaply priced, but still tasty.

On a side note, it was the first time I had grits. Cannot say I'm a fan, but I definitely would eat them again (they lack any flavor).

All-in-all: The staff were friendly, the food was good, and the cost was great! This place gets my thumbs up."
Uvq6V0G784vJzYFjLddIgg,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"Came to this place a while back and, while the food was pleasant, I cannot say that there was anything to set this place apart from the other restaurants in the area. The food was good, but slightly overpriced given that you are essentially buying a burger and fries. The staff is generally good at service, but overhearing employees talk about their personal life (especially where the management joins the conversation) usually makes for an awkward time. This is a place for people looking for a new experience; otherwise, I would recommend one of the other restaurants in the area."
v1lOO2jjHwhoX2fySoDkVg,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,2,"Normally I go to the Westgate location, but decided to give this location a try given its proximity to my house. In hindsight, I wish I would have spent the extra 10-15 minutes and drove to Westgate.

Food-wise, the place is the same as the other locations. Wings are great! However, the waitstaff makes or breaks a place. This place's waitstaff fell below expectations. The only thing I was asked upon entering the place was, ""Have you been here before?"" I did not get any ""Hello"" or ""Hi."" Rather, it seemed like I was bothering these girls. Again, the food was good, but the waitress just left me hanging pretty much the entire time. She'd appear here and there, but she really made any efforts to check on the table. It's one thing to see you walk by the table next to mine; it's another thing to have you actually ask me if there is anything I need.

All in all, I cut my stay and decided to go home and watch the game. For people that know me and how low maintenance and laid back that I am, it's pretty bad when I leave because of bad service. Do yourself a favor, hit the Westgate location or elsewhere. The waitstaff here have too many other things to worry about besides their customers."
8ysapimCImBSDKl28qIrjA,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,3,"First, the only reason this place gets three (3) stars is because of the food. The food is great! Probably the best Mexican food on the (very) west side. The reality of this place: It doesn't seem like anyone pays much attention to cleanliness. The two (2) times that I did dine in were enough. Food left on tables for over an hour; workers handling food after mopping (granted it was their own food, but if they do it to their own food...); and trash on the floors.

All-in-all: The food is great, but the facility is a dump. Do yourself a favor and get takeout."
tUrzToG0DOOO9gJqoWSRnA,1grF_MwPZRq1_698b1bymg,1,"This place tops my chart as the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. Having just been released from the hospital and given the okay to eat whatever I wanted, I fast tracked it to the nearest fast food joint I could find to grab a quick meal.

I was initially greeted with, ""What do you want?"" I brushed this aside despite it being overly rude and attempted to order food for my family. I say ""attempted"" because, for the first time in my life, I didn't make it past the drive-thru speaker.

While ordering, the lady taking my order began speaking with another employee about prices. About 15 seconds of this went on before she returned to speaking with me.

Having just waited for her to have a conversation that could've waited the 15 seconds it would have taken me to place my order, she begins speaking to me in a rushed manner. ""Do you want your combo 'this style, this style, or this style'? Size? What to drink?"" Not only was this the icing on the cake for me, but I looked at my fiance to make sure that I wasn't in the wrong. Her look was also that of disbelief. I calmly told the lady that she was being ""f***ing rude"" and left for what turned out to be a Burger King down the road. Despite the BK's slower than usual service, it was 10x better than what I received at this place.

All-in-all: This place marks the first time that I was unable to make it past the ordering phase at any fast food location. Considering the bad service I have received elsewhere, this place makes its way to the top of the list for worst overall. I will never return to this place."
AfN3Z1U6QPEgAb5F2CQm8w,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"This is currently my favorite place for wings in the valley! Specifically, the teriyaki wings. Not only are they big and delicious, but a dozen is only $6 during Happy Hour ($8 regularly). That alone makes me go out of the way to visit Casey Moore's when I'm having a craving, but I also love their cute patio and draft beers. Definitely check it out!"
JIETwXSEGIHMNyxZVEnNKQ,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"I love this place so much! The teryaki chicken bowl with sweet potato hash and a power green juice (add spinach) is my usual order and while sometimes I wish I'd try other item menus...I can't stray. It's too good to miss out on! Service has always been friendly and fast enough (but do be patient with the fresh juices). Outside seating is a plus. The only thing that would make me like Chop Shop more is lower prices, but I always leave feeling good about what I ate so it's worth it. Definitely stop by if you're in Old Town (although they have plenty of other locations, too)!"
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"I can't believe my sister almost forgot to take me here while I'm in town visiting! This place is AWESOME.

I mean, there were still a lot of people here...we were just lucky enough to snag a spot out front.

We were seated at a tall table on the patio, somewhat near a heater and ohmygosh, it was perfect outside. Our server was friendly and attentive, the food came out quickly, and I'm in love with their peach beer! Just like other Yelpers mentioned, the FRIES. They're really good, as was the Garden Burger which had melted pepperjack cheese, roasted red peppers, spinach, lettuce, and tomato. The sweet jalapeño sauce was too spicy for me on its own but tasted awesome on the burger. I like that you have to option to substitute the veggie burger patty in place of one of the other burger versions but lets be real - the Garden Burger has the best topping choices already.

Apparently their chicken tenders are amazing! The chicken egg rolls (umm, not sure what their official title is) weren't exactly what my sister was expecting and she'd probably order something different next time (this brings me back to the chicken tenders), but she still thought they were good and liked the jalapeño sauce and chipotle ranch to dip them in.

Atmosphere, service, food, local beer...this place is the total package! Definitely put it on your ""must see"" list of places to eat in Tempe!"
JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"After a fun day in the sun, my friends wanted to grab something to eat and chose Thai House because it was close by. They think it's less American-ized than others and has authentic spices / flavors, making it their favorite Thai restaurant around. While I wasn't able to notice a huge difference between the Pad Se Eu at Thai House and my favorite spot at home in Charleston, the food was very good with nice portions. I tried a few bites of my friend's Panang Chicken as well and oh my gosh, it was delicious! I would come back again just to order that for myself."
XC06xxb7FFYsXcI2E38IIw,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"After the amazing dinner experience I had here, I truly can not believe that Hillstone doesn't have a 5 star rating! I loved everything about it. The food. The atmosphere. The service. All top notch!

Since Tuesday nights are horrible for celebrating birthdays, my boyfriend treated me to dinner at Hillstone the following Saturday. We came around 7:00pm and were told there was an hour wait. (FYI, they don't take reservations). Luckily for us, there was one table open outside that we were able to relax at in the meantime. Never had I ever sat on a patio with air conditioning vents under the table, cooling your legs. Impressed from the start! A really nice, funny server took care of us as we had wine and french fries. At exactly the one hour mark, an inside booth was ready for us!

My bf had the Hillstone Burger with coleslaw. It was definitely worthy of being his only cheat meal of the week. There were multiple items on the menu that sounded great, but I ultimately ordered the Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Excellent choice, self! It was delicious. Another unique detail that I'd never seen before: Lemons were served in a cloth-like mesh bag to keep seeds from getting squeezed into your iced tea or food.

Then...surprise! Our server brought out a hot fudge sundae (with a candle on top) and a Nordstrom box. As it turns out, my bf had sneakily ordered dessert and given her my birthday gift while I was in the restroom. I did not see that coming! Haha. It was such a big bowl of ice cream that we couldn't finish it, but I will say that getting to pour the chocolate sauce on yourself was pretty fun.

All in all, it was a fabulous night and I'm so glad that a friend recommended Hillstone to us. I would definitely come back and suggest it to others for a special night out."
xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"I would definitely like to come back here again! Last week, I tried Genghis Grill for the first time, not knowing what to expect. The whole ""build your own bowl"" concept was actually really cool!

Luckily, my bf and I went for a late lunch so the place was relatively empty (as an indecisive person, I'd probably feel overwhelmed with the amount of options to choose from if there had been a line of people behind me). Lots of meats, vegetables, spices, and sauces offered! They even had 5 or 6 bases to choose from (brown rice, egg noodles, etc).

Despite not knowing what I was doing...I mean, there was no plan or coordination as to what would go well with anything. I was just throwing everything that looked good into the bowl. (Kind of like how I make my FroYo)...mine came out soo well! I think it was about $25 for our 2 medium bowls, which were both very filling and delicious.

An interesting place for lunch, despite its Tempe Marketplace food court-esque location."
yvwK4MO2qnSZE5ggYGyk1A,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"While I don't know if everything here is worthy of 5 stars, the Cashew Chicken that I ordered on Mother's Day was delicious and I would have given it 5 stars by itself! I had plenty leftover for lunch the following afternoon and it was just as good then. While I didn't enjoy the dish that my sister ordered as much (some kind of fried beef covered in sauce), it's one of her favorite dishes here. We had really good service despite it being a busy holiday and got free wontons in chocolate sauce at the end of our meal. The only negative aspect was that we were apparently seated right under an air conditioning vent because it was FREEZING! I overheard the table that was later seated beside us complain to the server that it was too cold, but there wasn't really anything they could or would do about it. All in all, it was one of the better Chinese/Asian restaurants I've tried since moving to Arizona."
2-_HV0XUYK64OylB5J4i6A,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"I'm so glad a co-worker suggested Mod Pizza for our lunch break today, because this place is awesome! Though I initially went in with the intent to get a BBQ Chicken or Hawaiian pizza, once I was on-the-spot with a million choices, all hell broke loose and I ended up selecting a strange combination of toppings. I believe it was along the lines of red sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, bacon, chicken, pineapple, jalapeños, and kalamata olives. WHAT EVEN. Baahahaha. Don't get me wrong, I love all of those things so I very much enjoyed my pizza, it's just that if you're an indecisive person, perhaps go in with a game plan so you're not overloaded with options. Or add ALLL the stuff and things because it's the same price anyways! I absolutely loved how thin the crust was! Service was super fast and friendly and the restaurant was plenty clean. The lemonade is on the tart side, but definitely good. As I was eating my pizza at Mod, I was already looking forward to coming back to create lots of new custom pizzas in the future! Well done!"
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"Quite frankly, my little sister doesn't understand why I write reviews on Yelp and it annoys her when I take pictures of food, but she has demanded that I give this place 5 stars and exclaimed, ""Look at the craftsmanship (of the pastry)...this is actually worth a photo!"" Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.

While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!

The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was ""effing delicious"" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy.

Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the ""Pilgrim"" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.

Definitely put this on your ""must see"" list of places to eat (for lunch)!"
HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"I spent my first year in Phoenix feeling totally hopeless about ever finding a decent Chinese restaurant. Then, Asian Cafe Express was discovered! I've dined in once and gotten carry-out twice and each time the food has been fabulous! I highly recommend the Creamy Chicken and Corn Soup (disclaimer: I add a little salt to it), Chili Sauce Chicken Dumplings (these are actually really salty - which I like), Beef and Vegetables with Brown Rice (SO good), and Boba Tea! The menu can be a bit overwhelming at first (as there are actually menus within the menu...if that makes any sense!), but now that I know what I want I don't have to worry. Haha. I'd be interested in trying other dishes, but seriously, the beef and vegetables are so delicious I can't bring myself to stray from them yet. I've even had leftovers that tasted better the next day. Lastly, the portion sizes and prices are great! This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in the valley for Chinese!"
W2CzAePJakvARgoQuohbOA,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"Having grown up in the Southeast where In N Out does not exist, I never understood why this place has a cult-like following. I'd see such excited social media posts with lots of pictures any time someone ate at one of these restaurants, which seemed no different than any other fast food burger joint. That's why I hadn't bothered to try In N Out, despite living in Arizona for the past 7-8 months. I must say, after visiting this location on a late Sunday afternoon, I have a better appreciation for this place. Not even taking the food into consideration, I was very impressed by how many staff members were working at the time - legitimately working. Everyone was seriously busy the entire time and providing excellent customer service. The restaurant looked very clean and I liked the transparency of being able to see right into the kitchen. Nothing was ""hidden"". Where else do you get to watch potatoes getting cut into fresh fries? Also, they seemed to really care about the presentation of their food. Which by the way, my cheeseburger was very good and I liked that I could get the onions sauteed. As a first-timer, I found the menu a little confusing (despite how completely basic it appears) because my friend was explaining all the crazy ways you can order. It's like a secret language I don't know - but want to learn. I kept it very simple this time, but would definitely come back here before ever going to Burger King or any other similar place ever again."
OQggqcQglU-lHY3rY-8Lhw,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"One of my favorite things to do in different cities is visit breweries, so when my friends and I stopped by Mother Bunch over the weekend, I was really excited! They had a large selection of their own beers and I was impressed by how many of them sounded appealing to me. I only tried 2, but will definitely be back for a flight to try more. It had a nice atmosphere and I loved the subtle pink and green color scheme. We were really low maintenance, but our server did a great job checking in on us even though she had several other tables and a large party at the time. The garlic dip spread was delicious to share. I'd totally recommend this place and look forward to visiting again."
mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"The pizza at Grimaldi's is 5 star worthy, but I have to knock them down one star for their prices. I knew what to expect because I've eaten at a Grimaldi's in Dallas and Charleston before, but still, it's expensive pizza considering they charge $3-5 per topping. What brought me in to this location is that I received a coupon for a Free Large Pizza with 1 Topping for my birthday, thanks to signing up for their email club (Thank you, Grimaldi's)!

Their shaded patio with misters and string lights was a nice spot to dine on a warm weekday afternoon. I was seated and greeted promptly, and checked on appropriately throughout the meal. For food, I had a small Caesar salad which could've been split with someone. Was it good? Yes, it tasted like every other Caesar salad I've ever had. Worth $8? Probably not. I'd prefer a smaller serving size for a smaller price, as $8 felt like a bit much for what it was really worth. The pizza however, was delicious! I love the thin, crispy crust and red sauce. I only had room for 2 slices at lunch, but am eager to have the rest as leftovers! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for an upscale pizza night."
6t7mlTVjDA9fhuFAZmVzAQ,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"I would give Portillo's 3.5 stars if I could, but I'm ultimately rounding up because both times that I've visited, the Italian Beef sandwich (Dipped) with sweet and spicy peppers was very good and I'd happily come back for the exact same item!

With that being said, the fries are generic and boring (in that they are the exact same frozen, crinkle-cut fries you can buy in the grocery store and make yourself). My bf ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was nothing special and ""very greasy"". Had he not tried 2 bites of my Italian Beef sandwich, he wouldn't have any desire to come back to Portillo's. However, he loved the beef and gravy with hot peppers and would definitely come back to get his own!"
GqGVAE3kbEW46FU1LydVUg,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,2,"My love for On the Border is no more. The last time my sister and I ate dinner here together, we both ended up really sick the next day. It took a few months for me to brave going back, but one day, I had a craving for Southwest Chicken Tacos. I ordered them to-go after work and while they tasted fine (post grease drainage), I can't say that the meal made me want to go back anytime soon. Sigh."
Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"My sister and I came here on a Friday afternoon for the lunch buffet (which ends at 2:30, just FYI). Although the food options were pretty limited, everything that I tried was very tasty! I liked that chai tea was included. We had no trouble with service, as everyone was pleasant, our water and naan were refilled throughout the meal, and tables were bussed promptly. I'd come back, but for $10-11 each, not very often. I'd rather try out some other Indian buffets that offer more."
8Zq11pzOup3-iwOjdMMwDQ,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"Oohhh, I usually order a Greek Night Club pita with chicken, but upon feeling indecisive and learning that Mika's has online ordering...one of the meat choices listed was 1/2 chicken 1/2 gyro. Um, yes please! They had all sorts of options that you can customize with a simple click of a button (white or wheat pita? no onions? extra sauce? cut in half? etc. Boom! Done.) It even gave me a pick-up time and I received text notifications when my order was in-process and ready for pick-up. Having already paid online, I just walked in, was handed my bag, and went on my way. The whole process was very simple, convenient, and fast! Plus, I didn't have to mispronounce gyro over the phone. Hahaha. Score!

My pita was excellent ~ stuffed full of gyro, chicken, lettuce, tomato, onions, kalamata olives, tzatziki, and feta! Mmm! It was a little on the salty side, which I actually like, but just something to consider if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. The side greek salad was also very good. One of these days I'll get around to trying the lentil soup...

All in all, you can get a great, fast, filling meal here for less than $10, that you feel about eating. WIN."
_nB8HNT2IDRhlAoY9TPYew,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,3,"My sister and I came to Sushi Time for the happy hour specials (Buy 1 large sake or beer, Get 1 small sake free, $1 off most sushi rolls) on a Thursday night. We ended up splitting a Spicy Tuna roll, Viva Las Vegas Eel roll, and Teryaki Chicken entree. While we both really liked the sushi rolls, I found the Teryaki Chicken to be on the tough / overcooked side. This was a small place, with a small simple menu. Although some sushi restaurants have an overwhelming amount of roll options, I felt like Sushi Time could've used more. The rolls just weren't all that enticing or creative. I'd recommend them for good, basic sushi in Tempe but wouldn't go out of my way to come here."
fSBhe0A6Dfa8JCYccfpMog,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,5,"I've always loved bagel sandwiches for breakfast and am so glad I found this place on Yelp! I've been to The Bagel Man twice now for a bacon, egg, and cheese on everything and both times it was excellent! I just moved to Tempe a month ago, but don't think I'll even bother trying other bagel shops. This one already has my heart with its bagel perfection and timely / friendly service."
EyE2NntpQyVPaLX7gSC9dA,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"I've ordered takeout from Sa Bai 2-3 times and have consistently been pleased! My meals have been ready for pickup quickly, and the portions are huge. For appetizers, I've tried the crispy spring rolls and crab wontons - both of which are good, though I probably prefer the wontons. The little salad with peanut dressing (that they serve with appetizers) is a nice touch. As far as entrees go, I've only ever ordered the Pad Thai from this restaurant, but I like it so much that I cant see why I'd order anything else. There are several other Thai places just as close to my house that I could order from, but I keep going back to Sa Bai because of positive past experiences. The restaurant is usually pretty empty inside when I've been by (last time it was completely dead), so perhaps takeout is the way to go."
TtbCOwOpNNzE7fW5CFwyng,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,3,"After hearing about Bosa Donuts from friends, I decided to try them out on none other than National Doughnut Day! They seem to get a lot of orders from drive-thru customers, as all 3-4 employees were eagerly talking through headsets and preparing orders while I patiently waited at the counter for someone to notice me. When a woman finally asked if I had been helped (umm, no m'aam you're the first person to speak to me in the 5 minutes I've been standing here looking at you), I ordered a half-dozen donuts ($5+) and went on my merry way. While Chocolate Frosted with Sprinkles will always be my first choice in doughnuts, I must say that the toasted Coconut doughnut was my favorite from here!

All in all, Glazed was fine (though lacking appearance points after getting all smooshed up while being put into the box), Cinnamon was good, they were out of Lemon-filled so I defaulted to Raspberry-filled which was better than I expected it to be, and I didn't care for the Maple Bar. I'm not dying to come back, as there are plenty of other doughnut shops I'd rather try instead, but if I were to find myself here again I'd definitely get more Coconut doughnuts."
RN0PTeMSF_eaeXN6VV7RwA,LBL-CSIhIQQgeQKs_c0GfQ,4,"I think the key to eating here is to go during HAPPY HOUR!! Otherwise, yeah, I'd agree with other Yelpers that paying $14 for a 5 piece speciality sushi roll is ridiculous. However, I had no problem eating the same roll for $7.75! ;)

When we first got here the hostess was seating a party of 2 in front of us, which was a very slow process. Then she came back and blankly said, ""How can I help you?"" Umm, how do you think you can help us? What kind of greeting is that? lol. Obviously we want help getting a table for 3. And thanks for being so friendly! Once sat, our server was nice and took good care of us.

Happy hour drink specials are about $2 cheaper than usual so it's not that great of a deal, but again, we saved almost 50% on the food...and it was delicious!

Between the 3 of us, we had edamame (nice and salty), crispy spicy tuna rice balls (4 of them - would be a rip-off normally), pork potstickers, spicy salmon roll, spicy calamari roll (very good), and 2 Viva Las Vegas rolls (fancy looking and mmmmm)!

They brought out the food as it was ready - meaning everything came out at different times (this would be really annoying to most people, but it worked out well for us since we were trying so many things and had a chance to enjoy them one at a time).

I liked the black and red interior too. Bottom line, this place is not as bad as other reviews make it sound. I liked it and would totally come back - but only between 4:00-7:00p.m. If you pay full price, you're doing it wrong."

She pointed out what she usually orders and I stuck close to it. I believe mine was #40 - the rice vermicelli noodles with BBQ beef and Eggrolls. It was delish and tasted considerably light for a noodle dish! My sister had the same thing, but with pork (I want to say #34 maybe). I would highly recommended both of them. And oh my gosh, the Thai tea with tapioca was the best I've tried anywhere. I would definitely come back for the same meal!"

Everywhere we turned things were out of order so we spent our $10 on Dance Dance Revolution and basketball. The music on some DDR consoles was SO loud we couldn't hear our own song when someone was playing beside us and the number of tickets received from games seemed to be totally random (as there were 3 of us playing and the winner always got less than the others - huh?) Also not a fan of the $2.50 card activation fee...whiiich we had to buy at the service desk because surprise surprise the automated machine was broken. I've never been charged tax to add money to an arcade card before either. Have fun, mall shoppers. I have no desire to visit this place again."

It's one thing to have a small garnish of cucumber in a drink but the flavor of the huge slice they put it the mug totally overpowered the drink even after I had pulled it out. 2) Don't get me wrong, I had plenty to eat and left with a full stomach from the burger and waffle fries, but for AZ 88 to consider 1 baby carrot and 1 piece of broccoli as a side of vegetables and 1 piece of honeydew and 1 small piece of pineapple as a side of fruit...what's the point? It's not even worth mentioning, or serving for that matter. All in all, I'd be happy coming back to eat at AZ 88 again (but I would order a different cocktail or get the delicious tropical unsweet tea); it just didn't jump to the top of my list of favorites in the valley."

I definitely prefer the other Chipotle located on Scottsdale Road, but since I needed something to eat and was already in this shopping center, I stopped in for a chicken bowl. Like many Yelpers have said, the portions here are pretty skimpy. They seemed to put plenty of sour cream on my food, yet very limited chicken and lettuce. I never want to ask for more, as you'd likely get charged for ""double meat"". Yeah, no. There wasn't enough in the first place. Think I'll go elsewhere next time. Chipotle just isn't worth it any more."

The side dishes are excellent. The last time I went was over the holidays last year and I had the pleasure of trying a bone-in filet for the first time. This was by far, hands down, the absolute best steak I have ever had. The clientele tend to be a bit pretentious, making for a somewhat stuffy atmosphere, but that is to be expected in Scottsdale I suppose. I never let it detract from the experience!"

I am updating because I have gone since and had their pizza, which was amazing and certanly deserves five stars! I had the loaded baked potato pizza. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The crust is so good! The toppings were high quality. Will surely go there for pizza again!

This place was ok. Got the tempeh hoagie and tomato bisque. The sandwich had way too many strong flavors; marinade, vinaigrette, pesto, feta cheese and sprouts. It was a bit much, but I was still able to eat it. The tomato bisque was another story. I am certain it was pizza sauce with broth whisked in. It was so thick I could eat it with a fork! The waitstaff was great. The ambiance was cool and different. I may go back to try the pizza and pretzels and if I do I will update my review. As of now it sits on the low side of three stars. Quality ingredients but poor execution in my opinion."
MVHGmZEwtKrXH11ySGweEw,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,3,"I found the term ""steam pot"" to be misleading. It is served in a small bowl, not a pot, and it is mostly pasta with a decent amount of fish and a very small amount of the more expensive seafood. My steam pot had salmon, and I did not care for it. However, I did find the small amount of seafood that was in the steam pot to be of quality. The staff was very friendly. I might try eating here again, but would likely go for happy hour or lunch instead of dinner."

The king crab and asparagus roll was the best sushi roll I have ever had...the asparagus was cooked to perfection and cooled to the perfect temperature, the king crab melt-in-your mouth goodness, and the plate was dotted with a delicious spicy red chili sauce that complemented it all perfectly! The tuna and scallion roll was fabulous...the tuna was very fresh and clean tasting. Our friends had the baked scallop roll and boy was that decadent! Yum! It was a California roll topped with scallops in a rich cream-based sauce, broiled beautifully. The plain California roll was also excellent. The king crab roll was very good...a pocket of nori stuffed with a wonderful shredded king crab salad. I don't know how any other sushi place in Phoenix is going to compare to this."
0FUtlsQrJI7LhqDPxLumEw,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,4,"One of my favorite places! Breakfast is awesome. They have really good pancakes and waffles. Lunches are also great. I love the fontina burger. The garlic fries are yum. The beet salad is tasty. The panko onion rings are crunchy and flavorful. It is a great place to eat outdoors during the spring and fall, and on cooler early mornings in the summer. The price is worth it when you consider the obvious quality of what you are getting on your plate. My only complaint is that the quality of their beverages (Coke products...blech) and their condiments (specifically the mayo and ranch dressing) don't match the quality of their food."
pWqtTbQsXMBevsKbyNgPcQ,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,1,"Wow...this was pretty bad. I mean almost everything was bad. The only saving graces were the bread and the iced tea. We both ordered combo platters with different things...brisket, chicken, pork. The brisket was bland. The chicken was dry. The pork was dry.

The meat sauce was very salty and bland. The ravioli was akin to the kind I imagine you would buy from the freezer section at Wal-Mart. The bread tasted like saltine crackers. The service was very good however and the spumoni ice cream was good. My bf really liked the fettucine alfredo. They did offer to replace my entree with something else since I didn't eat it, so I got some fettucine alfredo to go. I have a Groupon to come here with my son for a murder mystery dinner in a few weeks...hopefully the food then will be better."
O_J5e6aoskxhGx8meOm1Og,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,4,"This place is great! They have the best crab puffs in town. They give you enough food for two meals, and it all comes out hot and fresh. I love the walnut shrimp and the honey chicken. You can tell they use quality ingredients. The staff is friendly also!"
i0sp8DNw3FolMn-uGIkVyw,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,5,"I totally agree with what Ryan C. said. I am not a huge hot dog person either, and Dazzo's is one of the only places I get excited about getting a hot dog from. I can't speak for any of their other menu items, as every time I go there I just have to have the regular hot dog with everything. I got introduced to them from my husband, who has been going there since he was a kid.

The last time I went (yesterday) there was a young man working at the counter. He was friendly and professional. There were seven of us and our entire order was hot and fresh, and correct. The fries were so good! One of us got a hamburger (the rest of us hot dogs) and he said that was excellent too.

I don't get out to the Old Glendale area often, but when I do I always want to go to Dazzo's!"
fjvBTHjluJ_mo9BeHcHoBw,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,3,"It was ""ok."" We got the two for $20 deal. The artichoke dip was good, but not great. The ribs were surprisingly good. We ordered two (SMALL) apple margaritas, and I was stunned upon getting the bill to find that they were almost nine dollars each! A bit ridiculous to me. Our waitress was really not engaging, but the service was prompt."
ZcQkBoTtK1bDEo4Np7x0VQ,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,1,"I want to start this off by saying that I love to support local businesses and I know how bad reviews can hurt them. But this food was so bad I hopped on here for the first time in years just so I could warn people. The brisket was fatty and funky tasting. The country ribs were terrible. The turnip greens barely made it past my lips before being spit out. The ""coleslaw"" was the strangest version of coleslaw I have ever had...so much so that I wouldn't even call it coleslaw. It was tangy and dry and gross...and again barely made it past my lips before being spit out. I think it had dill in it? Very bizarre. In any case, I would never, ever eat from here again...even if it was free."
vz8HFGsITt6aj-nyXkAEFg,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,4,"I liked this place. I got the fundido and it was very good. My husband got the carne asada and it was really tasty too. If you don't like eating by a pond, then don't go. Personally I thought it was a unique and fun experience. There are seats indoors with glass between you and the pond if you are worried about an amoeba or duck poo jumping into your food. Oh, and the margaritas are OUTSTANDING...and I am very picky about margaritas.

If you are ever bored on a Sunday in October definitely check out their farmer's market. We went there for brunch yesterday...it was very good! They had an omelet bar, waffle bar, fresh fruit and pastries, and also some standard Mexican fare. The market was fun...bought some excellent pineapple habanero jelly. I wouldn't recommend the popcorn though, brought it home and it was STALE."
QssWqY44im2rA8hGmicv_A,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,5,"I was introduced to this place by my boyfriend. It's a small, family run restaurant that has been in the neighborhood for decades. Have been coming here for years now and have never had anything remotely bad. The spanakopita is to die for! The gyro plate is my favorite. Their soups are great. Their pitas are homemade. The baklava....mmmmm!"
vxuyl9IVum8zngXgvbT4Jg,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,2,The first time in had a burger and fries. They were ok. The second time had a hot dog here. It tasted ok but made me feel pretty sick later. Won't be going back.
nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,3,"Really, for the price, I expected more. I had the lasagna. I'm wondering if I ordered the wrong thing, because this place has some pretty stellar reviews on here. For similar prices though, for me, the food is better at Macaroni Grill and Oregano's. Additionally I found the ambiance to be pretty stifling and the waitstaff not terribly friendly to two people who came in wearing casual clothing."
pFA2l8MG7hFTmwc6zjDgtA,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,3,"Granted, this is a chain restaurant and is pretty standard American Chinese fare, it is the best option for Chinese food that we have nearby. I have never had any major complaints, just that the fried items sometimes aren't very hot. I LOVE their noodles and wish I had the recipe."
9Bg2JLQdyf97KlNuRQ56HA,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,2,"The young people in my life love this place. What is wrong with the youth these days? Their food tastes okay for fast Mexican fare. However every time, without fail, that I have eaten here, I have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later. Because of that I do not eat there."
1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w,sF9O19M0vajpN-3aiReviA,4,"I know it's considered lame to write about chain restaurants on here...but I digress.

I really enjoyed eating here. The only thing that wasn't good was the Moo Goo Gai Pan, but I've never cared for that anyway. Everything was fresh tasting, the restaurant was clean, and the waitstaff was friendly. Will definitely go again."
XC06xxb7FFYsXcI2E38IIw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Wonderful service! These restaurants seem to be known for that. Our server was fantastic!

Loved the French Dip here (as always!). Theirs is the best I have had! We all ordered it at our table except for one person ordered the veggie burger, and he is still talking about it a week later. Yummy brownie dessert as well!"
d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Our service was excellent! Very attentive!

The food was also pretty good for what it was, and the prices were decent.

We would however not return because the food is just not our style. While looking at the menu, nothing stood out to us. We literally didn't like the sound of anything on the menu. We did order two dishes, and they were good, but I guess it's just nothing we would ever crave.

We were here for a friend's birthday, and we did look at the menu online a few days earlier. Even then, nothing jumped out at us.

Our friends did seem to enjoy their meals though!

I would recommend looking at the menu first. If the dishes sound good to you, then I'm sure you will enjoy your meal!"
K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"The food here was very good and fresh! We were able to try multiple things off of the menu - guacamole, soup, white bean side, salads, and tacos. We just loved the decor of this place! All the leather was beautiful.

We knocked it down a star because: the server could have been better. While he wasn't awful, we think he was a bit snooty because we didn't order alcohol. Also, the tacos order was TINY! It was almost a joke! But, everything was very good."
TShoU62Hm-4wH2EzwkJbrg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,2,"What I ate here:

- Fried rice: great portion and very good!
- Spring rolls: NOT GOOD
- Tapioca: was more like a dessert smoothie? It was good, but I would like something that I could have with my meal

I would come back here, but it would need to be amazing for me to return again for a second time!"
UNfiku8qEyvGYjPK7w_gxQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"We enjoyed our meal here! The ambiance is great, and they even got some heaters going for us when it got a bit chilly.

The food was good as well - we had the salmon dish as well as the blue cheese burger. We also had the donuts for desert (yum!). We would probably return, but the prices are a bit expensive for the portion sizes. We were full at the end, but we didn't get to take home any leftovers!"
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,Very good food and very friendly service! Kids eat free every day all day too. Awesome! We liked the ambiance as well.
K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Make sure to sit at the chef's table. It's quite an experience! Here you sit at the bar facing the kitchen and the chef himself, Razz! They bring you small plates (priced at $10 a plate) until you tell them to stop. Both times we went, we stopped after 4 courses and then had the dessert (which was $20 for the shared plate and consisted of 3 ""slices"" of different desserts). I'd say the best part of the meals are the sauces - absolutely amazing! We made sure to have bread on hand to soak it all up. Each course is different from the next, and all of it is scrumptious! If you want a quicker meal, I'd say to get an earlier seating (6pm), as we were out in an hour. Last time, I believe we had an 8pm seating, and it was more crowded by then. Enjoy!"
g6B5hVt6oZRVO2wR4f0sNw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very good prices for food, and it's great! Wonderful service as well. I also love their selections of breads, meats, cheeses, etc, etc!

Some of the items in the store (not on the menu) are a bit overpriced. Also, when I have taken my sandwich home, it didn't last very long and wasn't nearly as good as it was in the restaurant."
FyKefsWq62xeXpje0Flcig,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Very friendly staff! Our server was very nice, and the owner stopped by to say hello. Our water glasses were always full, and our table was kept nice and clean.

The food is very good, and it is definitely reasonable for the price. The only complaint is that some of the food is VERY heavy. It felt a bit like a brick was in my stomach after we were done eating. Also, I heated up my leftover pasta the next day, and it was very easy to see all the oil that my pasta was drenched in.

All in all, great service and good food."
7yIHC8KsR5OaE_7MgEBVhw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,2,"Eh, this place is not too good. I definitely wouldn't choose to return here.

The food is just OK, which makes it way overpriced for what it is. Nothing on the menu is special or unique. We also felt like our stomachs were carrying huge bricks after we ate here.

Our server was also rude and not very attentive. His mind seemed to be somewhere else the entire time, and it seemed like he didn't want to be there at all."
0B_aEPeZjrXs6T7vS3arrA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Great place!!

Very friendly service. Everyone was so nice. This place is very clean, and it has a nice, casual atmosphere.

The rolls are outstanding!

We ordered the lobster bisque, scallops, and coq au vin. Everything was excellent. The salads with the entrees were great as well. Wish we had time for dessert, but we unfortunately had a prior engagement.

We will definitely return!"
B56AYe5GNuavMDtwFsXqzA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"We love the setting of this place - it feels like we're in France! It's cozy and beautifully decorated. The food is very delicious and fresh, and they definitely try to make every item unique to them. We took a family friend here who reviews restaurants, and she called this place ""very memorable."" I say that's about right!"
aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Love the fresh food here and the changing menu! We also loved the complimentary amuse bouche, cotton candy, and take home treat. The music and atmosphere was wonderful.

Our absolute favorite was the cold corn chowder soup - to die for! We also very much enjoyed the delicious doughnut dessert.

For dinner, I ordered a scallop dish. The scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly. They were a bit salty. The rest of the dish was very interesting, although I am not sure if I can say that I loved it. It was good though, and it was presented beautifully. My boyfriend ordered the pasta dish with egg noodles. He enjoyed it - I just thought it was so-so.

Very nice wait staff as well!"
OY0-hYJ2q6WiAqhYnCZZ0w,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very cool atmosphere, and the food is cheap and good! I like how unique it is. The sauces are great and the toppings on the brats. Fun place! Will return!"
xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Lots of different options and good pizza too! Our server was a little off, but mayeb she was just having a weird day."
PNTyiqS7R-0c1ofxOfDijQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"We have been here for dinner and brunch once and for lunch multiple times. Each meal was fabulous! Our favorites are brunch and lunch - such wonderful flavors and fresh food! We always make sure to order different items, so we can try everything!

Christopher is very kind and attentive, and it is obvious that he really takes pride in this place. We love how beautiful the restaurant is, both inside and on the patio.

This is definitely one of the places we go to when we have out-of-towners here. We will continue to come here many times over!"
aqrTv6QiU0J9Sxm_T--c5g,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,2,"This place was just eh. . .we ordered 2 meals and a dessert. One of the meals was pretty good, but the other meal wasn't so much. The dessert, creme brulee, was awful! Not the worst place I've eaten at, but I definitely won't be returning."
b83NNHvvWQk-DTTzs-3WLA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,This is our favorite sandwich place! We will always come here when we are craving a sandwich. Daniel & Nick are especially great and super friendly! They really care about customers' needs and want to make sure we get what we want. We will be returning again and again!
HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Cool ambiance. We like the live music too! The heaters outside were great.

The portions were huge! Our least favorite part of the meal was the mussels appetizer. We wouldn't order that again. We ordered the pork and short ribs. The short ribs were great! Our sides were the mashed potatoes, green beans, creamed corn, and the cornbread. We liked them all except the green beans were just okay. We also ordered a sundae for dessert, which was huge!"
8jHLEXfoy3Q9TdvJYvtWvg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"I have always enjoyed Benihana! The food is very good for the price you pay, and I just love how I am able to eat a bit of everything while I'm there. We have had some great chefs too.

The only thing is that some of the servers have been a bit slow before. Otherwise, this place is great!"
OfITr0B8bZU3vukSQJIrWQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,Ordered their shrimp tacos and their chips with guacamole. Everything was great! Loved how the tacos were mini flour tortillas instead of corn ones :-)
4CdqGdbYBjRCyvUDx7ppYQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"We returned here this past week, as the owner reached out to us to extend his apologies for their very busy grand opening. They really did have a ton of people there that day!

We got the fiesta bowl again, and it was so much more flavorful. We also got the salmon salad wrap, and that was very good as well. The smoothie was great (as it was last time too).

The service was much quicker and more on the ball, and the staff was friendlier. The place also has a great vibe!

We saw a good number of people coming in as we were there, and we were glad to see it, as we love seeing people making healthy choices when they eat. Organic is also a plus!

It is so nice to meet an owner who really cares about his business and wants to improve upon each aspect of it. We would definitely give this place an A++ for customer service!"
PDKq1UQQG1UjVRJ12weQ8A,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,One of my favorite places to eat! I have eaten so much there. Love the lemonades and teas too. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. It's great to be able to go with our baby too! Very clean - and great ambiance!

VoTi4yVhTVyFdmxUpoyUsg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Delicious homemade food! Everything was so great and fresh, and the service was very friendly! We had the shrimp tacos, nachos, and quesadilla. Even the picky little boy we were with liked this place....better than McDonald's...which is a huge feat!"
NXN_rVXsvJJVgm47k99Gtw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Wow! What a fun experience to sit at the bar! We got the seafood corn chowder, crab gumbo, and crawfish pan roast. Everything was delicious! And the lunch portions were just perfect. We can't wait to return!"
YiuI4YHJnrl9898gE50_ow,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,2,"Eh, the food here was just okay. I would definitely prefer to eat somewhere else for the money.

The service was friendly, and the tater tots were good!"
urkODQ1jX0qQzgbqsQjWVQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Such a great ambiance and atmosphere! Love all of the menu and tea / lemonade options. We have had the quinoa salad, tomato soup, beef wrap, avocado hummus, and a few other items, and they all are amazing! The prices and service are great as well. We can't wait to return!"
fnaDx7UD4MiodQlgYHDwsQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,1,"Very nice service here, but the food was NOT good. We had multiple items from the menu, and none of it was good. The decor is somewhat depressing.

All in all, it made us wish we were eating Chinese in San Fran."
5DT2qxCkXxUKW7z_4kOXmA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,Good prices! Really liked the crispy eggrolls. The Pad Thai and the pineapple fried rice were pretty good. The Pad Thai had a bit too much sauce for our taste. The Thai iced tea with boba was also pretty good. Will probably return.
u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Great food, service, ambiance, and prices! Had a great time ordering a bunch of the bruschettas, and we just paid $10 a person. Our server was very nice and attentive and easy going. I will definitely return!"
j2bx_ctb_ED3zbfSaqhQmQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"I would say this place is pretty good. Wouldn't get excited about coming here, but wouldn't be opposed to it.

They were very nice about moving us to a booth when we asked, and the service was pretty good. We really liked the bread! The special was a fish dish, and it was pretty good. I ordered a salad with chicken, and it was decent. We were hoping for some good vegetarian options, but they didn't seem to have any."
pw9ErdIO1t7CWLrZwNP1fw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very good sushi at pretty decent prices! We had their Ebi nigiri, Vegas roll, California roll, Alaskan roll, shrimp tempura, etc. Everything was good! Our waitress was also very patient, friendly, and attentive. All four of us enjoyed our meal. We would definitely return!"
-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"The food here was good! We really loved the naan.

We would have given the place 4 stars, but we knocked it down a star because the price is a bit much for a vegetarian meal and counter service. The vegetarian options were around the same price as the meat options. Garbanzo beans and lentils are much cheaper than lamb and beef!"
0VOh4VIq13oFburRU9gddw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"The atmosphere of this place is great! Very friendly and local feel to it. I tried a few things here:

- Zucchini & onion rings: pretty good, but nothing special
- Garbage salad: very tasty and fresh!
- Pizza: Great crust and toppings
- Rootbeer float: Yummy!

The best thing about this place is the price. So cheap!

The server was very friendly and attentive. However, when we asked for separate checks, she seemed upset. I would tell her to lighten up!"

RQTatUj2f9Nz9JViTH4aAQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"The food was very good, and the view is spectacular! This is a great place for a nice meal out or for a celebration. They were generous with their portions and even brought us two soups (when we had only asked to split one). The service was also very friendly and knowledgeable.

Our main issue was that the soup we had was WAY too rich (too much creme or butter or something?). It was delicious, but part of the way through, we suddenly felt massively full. We had a hard time eating the rest of our meal and had to bring most of it home. We both had that sick-full feeling throughout the rest of the night. Maybe it was just us, as we normally eat healthy, so it might have been a shock to our stomachs. Otherwise though, the food was very good!"
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Food was pretty good, and it is definitely authentic British food. We also liked the feel of the place. Our waiter service was very good as well!

I think that this type of food is just not my thing though. It was a bit heavy, and I had a stomach ache that evening. It also seems to be a bit dirty (the place is dark, so it's difficult to see!)."
p81LV6y6Jxz_q_3HL06jOw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,2,"Eh, this place is not good. The food isn't fresh, and it just plain tastes bad. It is far too pricey for how mediocre it is. The service is also not so good, and the servers can be a bit unfriendly.

The only time I would ever come here is when my friends want to go here (even then, I try to tell them not to go!). The happy hour can be okay, but I would definitely rather go somewhere else!"
NUT7tou1Uvjh0GB4I41Qig,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Very good Thai food and reasonably priced as well. The service is friendly, and the atmosphere is very laid back and casual. Make sure to go in for happy hour. They have some great specials!"

PS2s35zZsbdW3r_JjudFOA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Pretty good for sushi in Phoenix! The service was friendly, and they have a good happy hour. Very good for the price too. Would definitely return!"
-ITj6Pu8Gdw8MmLf0XBEKQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very fun way to enjoy sushi and other Japanese dishes! Every table has the opportunity to grab dishes coming by, and they are all priced at $5 or less (although nobody at our table got an item over $3). So, the prices are very reasonable! Our server was also very attentive and friendly. This is a great place to go if you are trying to satisfy your sushi craving!

It's a little set off from the street, so it can be a bit difficult to find. Worth the find though!"
GdMRHtxg2oD5E2WzZccOqA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,2,"I would give this place more stars if the prices were lower or the food was better. Unfortunately, expensive prices for mediocre food is not for me.

We tried 5 dishes here, and neither of us were excited about any of them. The calamari was bland and rubbery, the patatas (although cooked very well) were doused in too much sauce, and the cheese croquettes were just okay. The filet was the best thing we ordered, and it was pretty good. The creme brulee dessert was not very good.

Our server was very friendly, but the server for nearby tables was quite loud and annoying.

All in all, I would have been pretty happy if our food cost half as much as it did."
OZqAZkjhV_nyHsbnKaD1WQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Good food for very good prices! The portions are generous, and you also get a soup and/or salad (depending on lunch or dinner). The service is good too. Will definitely return!"

Between the four of us, we ordered drinks (great margaritas!), the trio chip appetizer, tacos, and sopapillas. All of the food was very good.

The prices here are excellent. Our total bill was very inexpensive for all that we ordered. This is a fun hangout spot!"
BGGQOJQTQerEQu0kHbT_UQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"I used to love this place, but now I have to knock their review down a bit. I mainly enjoyed the French Dip here, but sadly, they no longer serve it.

The last time we came here, they misplaced the reservation I made with them. After some cajoling, they got us in earlier than they originally stated. Dinner was pretty good, but it was not as good as I had remembered.

I'd say I would give it 3.5 stars. I wish Yelp did half stars!"
zaBk2imYnk7rG7IdOMhRmA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very good Thai iced tea, spring rolls, and vermicelli bowl with eggrolls! The pad thai was just okay. The staff was super friendly. Very clean and quick service too!"

The only drawback so far has been the service, which has so far been just so-so."

The food was good, but we are not sure why everything is priced so high? It is definitely more expensive than it should be. $12 for a cup of onion soup? What?!"
7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Very good food, but I think there are much better places right nearby. It has a nice ambiance, but the food was not anything special. I would definitely return, but I would not go out of my way to go here."

There were people of all types and ages there; it really is a welcoming place for anybody. They also had a few different activities going on (poker, karaoke, etc.)

Pretty good food for the price! We had the chicken tenders w/fries and the caesar salad with grilled chicken. Both were pretty cheap and were a good size.

Our server was a really sweet and laid back guy. The food came out fast.

All in all, this is a fun place for a quick bite to eat with waiter service. The food is also very plentiful and good, especially for the price we paid."
LpHi2ooFxVn5Ntttw_IcaQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very delicious and fresh food! I love the various menu items and what they have to offer. We came here for dinner with a friend from out of town, and everyone at our table was more than satisfied! I love how this place supports local produce and farms. Yum!"
-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"Four of us went here for dinner tonight. We all agreed that the food was decent. It wasn't bad by all means, but it wasn't amazing. The prices were pretty good. The portions were okay - I know most places here in America serve way too much food, but it felt kind of funny to finish a meal and still feel hungry (I almost never finish my entire meal). We probably won't be back unless someone else want to go there, but we definitely don't have anything against this place."
K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Great prices and very nice service! There were lots of options on the menu, and they were very helpful with answering our questions. We ordered the mango lassi, garlic na'an, chana masala with batura, and the coconut uthappam. Everything was delicious. We will definitely return!"
-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"This place is pretty good. The decor was great! The service was very good.

The food was good, but not exceptional. We expected the prices to be much lower than they were.

Overall, it is good and we would eat there again, but we wouldn't go out of our way."
kblFxfo_xnMUZF0U0aGXQw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"The wonton soup was pretty good. The broth and veggies were tasty. The noodle part of the wontons were also good. The meat was a little off.

The pad thai was also decent. A tad spicy for our taste. It was also a little pricey. But, the portion was large!

I would probably give it a 3.5 if I could."
cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Very friendly service, delicious food, and cheap prices! What more can you ask for? We have taken every out-of-towner to this place to eat, and they all have loved the food, decor, and friendly staff. They are great about giving samples of about 6 different items from the menu, and they help fill out your order card as well. Everything tastes really fresh, and they have a ton of options. They're also great about substituting items as well. Definitely a must-visit!"
LelAlfuj5oVRF9CQdWLsNQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"We had a pleasant experience here. The ambiance and decor are all very nice.

Our server was friendly, and the food came out quickly. There were plenty of different menu items.

We ordered the kale and garlic dip, which was very good! For dinner, we had the burger and the veggie pasta. Both were good. We probably won't be rushing back here, but it was definitely worth a try. And I'm sure we will return again in the future!"
pTZ4u-sEQr-yHq2Cl4EMEw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,2,"Had a decent experience here for my fiance's birthday. We loved the ambiance, but our service was not good. Our server took forever to come to our table, and about half of what we ordered got messed up. Then when they brought out the dessert, they wrote the wrong name on it. I received a call from the manager the following week, and he apologized and said he was going to send us something. He never did. It's been 10 months."
m2zASwlOL2vecCKHfmGAnQ,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Everything we have had here is delicious! We have now been a couple of times, and we loved everything we had. The ambiance and the service are both great as well. We will definitely be back and are so glad to have such a delicious restaurant so close by!"
yZAGhlsrmupLbrgdKm6reg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,4,"Fun atmosphere and very good service. We liked all of the sports memorabilia. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and patient. The busboys were also very attentive and friendly. We especially were glad to have been given good service even though we did not order any beverages (you'd be surprised at how many servers are rude to us after they discover that we won't be ordering alcohol).

Food was good! We enjoyed: the bread, sweet and sour cabbage soup, caesar salad, baby back ribs, salmon, mashed potatoes, and creme brulee. The chopped liver at the beginning of the meal was also a nice bonus!

Only cons would be that the french fries were mundane. Also, we were a little confused about what was a part of the meal (sides, soups, etc), what was an upcharge, what we couldn't add, etc. It wasn't outlined on the menu, and our server had to explain a couple of times.

The manager came by after to ask how everything was. Very nice!"

XqSN1PtZkJ6QorOUa9AAdA,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,3,"Went for dinner for my moms birthday! Had the fried eggplant  and the bone in rib eye. Food was good. We had gone to the bar and ordered some drinks then we were given the option to cash out and pay or transfer the bill. We chose to pay but then after we were seated and tried to Order the same drink (wine), they told us we could no longer get that same wine. However the waiter still received his drinks from that same bar. We just felt it then forced us to order the cheapest bottle as an alternative which was 60 dollars.
Service was great! Jeremy was very nice and knowledgable.
Very pricy but definitely enjoyed ourselves."
lwpQQflP1CGJPV7QLybzOg,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,4,Place is so cool!  The waiters look like theyre using their cell phones yet theyre actually placing your order on phones. Our drinks arrived while our waiter was still taking our order. Now that's impressive! Awesome food as well and good pricing!
avKtXuzalCP_cVfrk-fLeQ,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,"Fortunately right now, we live close to Bridgette's!  I love going on a fri or sat night! Constant flow of different customers and they all leave happy! I'm personally in love with the southwest chicken Philly! Think it's the only thing I've ordered in 3 years! The girls that work there have been there forever! Shannna is the best!, she's so sweet!
Long story short, we love this place!!"
6ByEVNwpXqh-e9lNQ_X47w,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,4,Absolutely love this place however the service needs some help. Every time it seems like they're gone forever. Like the bar and kitchen is miles away. Love the dining experience Howe er service needs work!
YM0N9957U2rFDsNYXUqE1g,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,Always great food and fun environment. Awesome  cheeseburgers and fries!! Also excellent pulled pork. One of my favorite stops in cavecreek!
vtGwb-yl69LT96mHVllWeA,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,4,Went here 2 or 3 weeks ago. Had been meaning to go for a while and this time we did. Fried chicken was amazing! Would definitely go back. Reasonable prices and  great food. Waitress was very nice as well. Looking forward to coming again!
WSdANzoNmwLPAVuVw5SOFw,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,I visited nimbus today with my fiancé and dog. They have an outstanding outside patio and are dog friendly. I'm on a special diet and the waiter was very accommodating with me. The food was excellent and I'm afraid everybody's missing out on a great place hidden just on scottsdale rd. service is always great! See you again really soon!
UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,Definitely our family favorite place to go! Love the French dip and the code steak salad! Amazing glazed carrots never disappoint! White chocolate martini is a must have!
o9IvrLWtTt5lCYqO-uiJLg,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,I'm pretty sure this was the best breakfast I've ever hAd! Happy Labor Day to me! Great place to sit outside and beautiful views! Love the cheese steak and the wagon wheel breakfast! Can't wait to come again!
7N3MyhBXZxT7vK9bvH0lfg,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,"I think this is a great little place! I've been 2 times now and both times has been perfect. There's room for a live singer or band and is a little cramped but that's almost what's so nice about it. Especially fun for football I'm sure! Pizzas are wonderful! So are all the appetizers! There's horse racing inside and songo which is bingo with songs. Think it's Chicago based, very well done!"
SiKTElhCaJGhAdySd7JSHA,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,"Excellent chicken park and pizzas. Really, you can't go wrong with anything here. I love amaro because its minutes from my home and its a nice and classier place than most and still affordable.  Always have great service and sometimes a live singer at the bar. One of my personal favorites right in my neighborhood. Food is never a disappointment."
oMkFZJK82hNMxFKRLZUtKw,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,3,"My husband and I have come every weekend since you opened. Normally it's decent but this last visit was a total disaster! You sent out these mailings and were definitely not prepared for it! People that sat after us were served immediately and left 20 minutes before us... it took 15 minutes of us sitting before we even had a server... then our drinks took forever to come and it was like our server forgot about us... then we order and she tells me she thinks they're out of one of the breads.... so she brings out my meal and some pancakes that we never even ordered! So they took it back while I ate alone and my husbands finally came out when I was done! Waitress showed no remorse and we were beyond irritated while walking out! Then I go to cash out and the lady asked everyone else how their experience was except for us.... then I tell her and she shrugs... fantastic!
Ruined our Saturday morning as we then left grumpy and obviously that set the course for the rest of our day!
Won't be back now for a while til the nonsense if figured out!
I'm totally disappointed because I was enjoying going out to breakfast every weekend and this ruined it for me!"
kxzS-zh5nUNvBzYz2Q47pg,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,"Love this place! Everything is great here!!
Jalapeno shooters are great! enchalitas also a fav!
Miss the Ben and Jerry's downstairs!"
iuSq6jpt-r-7JxqXE5hK6g,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,1,Just tried to get breakfast and walked out. We walked in to no one even saying hello but 2 girls talking to each other. Waited 3 awkward minutes for them to finally say something and was finally say outside. Then sat for 30 minutes without anyone even saying hi or getting us a drink. Walked out and never coming back! You guys suck!
xVoPh8oCb29J5dMURoowBg,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,4,"Went there for dinner with my parents last night. Pizzas are great however I'd love to see ricotta cheese on the build your own pizza list. We all enjoyed wine and salads and the pizzas. Margarita pizza I thought was the best! Great food and atmosphere! Love this place!
Service was young happy gentleman that was extremely attentive."
-6h3K1hj0d4DRcZNUtHDuw,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,Absolutely my new favorite place! Just had my bridal shower there! Matthew was  great and also was Kimberly!!! Outstanding service! Exceeded my expectations!! Food was also out of the world!! Everyone was so pleased and they were beyond accommodating! Thanks guys! You're the best!!
mygLP5-SCnQwIev6LU9gWg,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,Been here many times now. Food is absolutely outstanding!  Very nice people inside. Food is always so fresh. Excellent for take out though you can sit there and eat. Strip plaza isn't appealing but this place is a rare gem!
IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,3,"Food was awesome however the service definitely needs work. Our waiter had absolutely no personality and never once asked us how everything was. He definitely seemed annoyed that he even had to help us. What could've easily been a great experience, resulted in an ok one."
e7bcP2P8WO0NFe1DjjoYQA,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,"Best fried chicken I've ever had! Husband had country fried steak which was also amazing!!! He are from both plates!!!
Can't wait to come back for a burger!!!"
2NICrHy0I5rlEJmlt0ao9A,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,2,"Went there yesterday for lunch. Wanted to sit outside however there were so many flies. Not appealing while eating. Also, we then decided to get it to go and we never received our order of fries after we did pay for them. Realized after we got home. Bacon was also really fatty on chicken club. Poppers and mozzarella sticks were good though.  Do not order a salad, they're cheap on the lettuce!"
-DrDzpZaMrNnH55ZVyTXRQ,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,4,"Went for lunch with my mom one day this week. Was excellent! Had chicken and fish tacos. Mom had the salmon salad which she also loved!
Wonderful environment and zack was our waiter. He was so nice and sweet. Helped due with recommendations and we were very happy. Margarita was also great! Can't wait to come back!"
dPGs5b0N9MarZjVgQVelGQ,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,4,Stopped in for lunch. Had the chopped salad. Awesome!! Cannot say enough about this place! Beautiful restaurant and excellent service!  Will see you again soon!
36GvUjLg3drdOB3jgpqTOQ,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,"Outstanding food!
Had the salad with shredded beef and was really tasty. No dressing needed here or even salsa for that matter. Service was great as well. Cute little place. Enjoyed myself and the atmosphere here."
e1i5mbYpFV8rQtfqtVwq3w,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,1,"When we arrived, we chose to sit outside. Immediately we were approached, asked what we'd like to drink and also asked if we were ready to order. We had literally JUST sat down. Never even opened the menus. No big deal... Maybe they were busy or just ahead of themselves however next thing we know, we order and wait FOREVER for our food. It's eggs guys not a roast! We finished the half pot of coffee we were left and waited til we got our food to get more coffee. Then we decided to pay 2.00 dollars more for these speciality pumpkin pancakes and they ended up being raw in the middle and mushy. We were gonna tell our waitress but we saw here right after we were served our food and hadn't even had a bite of the pancakes yet to tell this to her and she i guess was under the impression we were set and was just given the bill.
Then, it gets worse. We got to check out and the girl asks, how was everything today and my husband simply said great however the pumpkin pancakes were a little disappointing. Thinking shed ask why... She didn't and just carried on like nothing.
Over an hour and a half for breakfast at 11 am on a sat for 35 dollars??
Save your money for dinner people."
3HZAVQyr_9MfwGYilSYHsQ,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,5,"This used to be kashmans but honestly, the only thing they had that you guys don't is the jalapeño infused bacon southwestern omelet. I always thought they were so rude and never understood why they're customers we're so loyal... Must have been the food!!! Love the place now!! Much better atmosphere!!!"
zrDi4gEaUi64lAMfJU51dw,IOqNXU0Hcl5kA4xmTE-MLw,4,Went for dinner for my mother in laws birthday! Had a very comfy booth in the corner on top. Was extremely nice environment and everyone's food was perfect. I especially loved the French dip. Can't wait to come back! Excellent service!
QsMR_Fp9YRtDegThsOgFLA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I like small plates (""Asian tapas"" just sounds like an oxymoron) restaurants, and Sens did not disappoint.  You can tell they pay attention to details by the menu holder on the side of the table (for when you drink too much and need to order another plate).  I was also very impressed with our server who carefully described the night's specials down to how each will be plated.  The overall service was really good and I think the owner constantly patrolling the joint has much to do with it.

Now to the food.  It was above average, but nothing spectacular.  I agree with one review that all the sauces taste alike with different amounts of spiciness.  Nevertheless, I liked all the dishes my friend and I shared: tuna tartare, ground pork on sugar cane, duck salad, fried quail, and green tea cheesecake.  Some comments: the tuna chunks were too big to be considered a tartare, the duck salad was a little plain considering it has the same sauce as the tartare and the pork, and the pork portion is relatively big for those complaining about small plates.

The drink menu is extensive with a good selection of sake and cocktails.  I had a shochu drink which was tasty but got watered down by the ice really quickly.  My friend's saketini was also good.  Note to owner: you are not fooling anybody if every drink section is described as ""potent"".

In general, I thought the prices and portion sizes are comparable to other small plates restaurants.  The experience was good for a night out, and I will definitely return.  However, some foodies may be disappointed."
NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"I am really impressed with this restaurant/bar.  I got the delux burger which was very flavorful, although the bread was a little too dense.  The sweet potato fries, served in a mini shopping cart, are awesome - a must have.  They have a great selection of beer, including my favorite framboise lambic.  The beer flights might be an interesting choice for my next visit.  The decor is nice with soothing blue lighting.  Be aware of the close sitting quarters.  I wasn't sure about the communal counter in the middle of the restaurant, but it turned out to be pretty good.  I was still able to have a decent conversation with my friend without feeling like someone else is listening to us or like I am intruding on another conversation.  Overall, a great place that I will visit again.  Especially since it is open late."
CtfCmOhJvpnTFcKm_MyQwA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"So far so good.  Since their opening, I have already been here 3 times.  It is nice to have a juice bar so close to home.  I have tried every category of the menu: juice, smoothie, acai bowl.  Favorites so far are the sublime juice and the acai banana berry bowl.  Beware, the bowl is big.  The juices taste fresh and the sitting space is kept clean.  Service is friendly.  Prices are in line with the last juice bar I visited - Whole Foods.  I can't wait to try other juices and bowls."
2g4ZTD3ePNSbDAvh6qAOKQ,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I admit it.  I found this place through Man vs Food.  It did live up to the hype and not just for the tortas.  But first, let's start with the tortas.  I can only speak for the torta del rey and it was as huge as the one on TV.  The mix of meat along with egg, tomato and avocado was delicious and the taste very unique.  Something that does not get enough attention is their large selection of fruit juices and smoothies.  Since I couldn't decide between all the juice choices, I got a plain old pina colada.  It was really good - not too sweet.  My friend was more adventurous and got some drink named _?_eskimo_?_ - also very good.  Next time I go back, I will definitely try a fruit juice.  They had a lot of fruit in their fridge so it should be good.  Another plus is their 99 cent ceviche tostada.  It is a small tostada topped with shrimp ceviche and a slice of avocado.  Very refreshing and a great way to ease yourself into consuming a torta.  Lastly, the service was good and the inside of the restaurant was bright and clean.  There is no reason not to go back.  Remember to bring your appetite because the sandwich is quite filling."
aw0H9O1yysoHB0JanT0Ubw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I came here after finding out that King Gyros is closed on Sundays.  After driving all the way from Chandler, I was not going home without some meat.  Thankfully Chicago Gyros was nearby and I remembered it had good reviews.  I had the Chicago gyro with Greek salad.  The gyro was very good.  Plenty of meet with good tzatziki sauce, tomato, and onion, wrapped in a chewy but not too heavy pita bread.  The flavor combination was just right and I devoured the whole sandwich.  I was not too impressed with the Greek salad.  For some reason, the dressing tasted a little bitter.  I also tried some of my friend's fries.  The texture was good.  Nice and fat.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  But somehow, I could not get enough potato taste out of it.  I'm not sure if it was their potato or their oil.  I'll just stick with the pita sandwich next time.  This place is way too far to drive to on a frequent basis, but they just opened Pita Heaven in Chandler and I think it is related.  I will try that next time."
GfHBBCi6LJAPVFTcCwu9aQ,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"This is a casual wine bar with surprisingly good food.  The place is small and dimly lit -- very cozy.  The bartender/ waiter suggested a cabernet from Spain? which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I also had a chicken panini with sweet potato chips.  The food can take a while, but I realize that this is a bar, not a restaurant, so it is OK.  And the sandwich was really good!  Bottomline, Centro is a quiet/intimate place to relax and catch up with friends."
7Ny2GHLw8xl_kXfhfrvh5w,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"I have came here 3 times since opening for 2 brunches and a dinner.  Everything I've had here has been good: open-face breakfast sandwich, short rib benedict, pork chop.  I think the breakfast pricing is a little steep ($15+ with entree and coffee).  The dinner pricing is more reasonable but still over $25 for entree and 1 drink.  I guess I just do not feel like this restaurant is very special.  I'm not sure if it is the cold setting as another review suggested or the impersonal staff.  Somehow, I am not drawn to go back.  If you are in Chandler and need a clean restaurant with reliable food, BLD is still a good choice.  Just don't expect to be wow'd."
d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I was very happy with my experience at Citizen Public House.  The service was great.  My friend and I sat outside on the lounge area while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  The area was small, but pleasant and the staff was very accommodating.  After our party arrived, we went inside for our meal.  The dining room has great atmosphere.  It was casual, but you still felt like you were at a nice restaurant/bar.  The pork belly pastrami was awesome even though my friends complained the appetizer dish was too small.  I mean, how much pork belly can one really eat?  For entree, I got the pan seared scallops which were great.  The portion was a bit small, with just 3 scallops.  I did not mind it as I was not very hungry, but others may have a problem with that.  For drinks, I had sangria, which was tasty.  My friends got the Citi-Zen which they enjoyed.  They guys were not too thrilled about The Persian cocktail because they claim there was not enough alcohol.  Overall, 5 stars because I had a really good time and all the food that I tried were good.  -1 star for being a bit too pricey for what they have to offer and also some others in my party were not completely thrilled with their food/drink choices."
K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,2,"The pork shoulder tacos and sangria were very good.  I especially liked the tiny corn tortillas.  The atmosphere was nice and very classy.  There were lots of candles, big mirrors on the walls, and chandeliers.  I think the waitstaff was the one downer from the visit -- they were cold and did not try to provide a pleasant experience.  Overall, I just did not think The Mission was anything special.  It's a dime in a dozen in Scottsdale."
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"do not be fazed by the massive amount of people waiting outside.  just put your name down on the notepad and make yourself comfortable.  the wait on a Sunday morning was 1 hr, which really is not all that bad.  turnover rate is quite fast.  the breakfast was very good and worth the wait.  i had the pork chop and eggs.  the chop was nicely marinaded and cooked well.  the toast was thick cut, with the right amount of butter (i.e. not soaking wet), and came with good strawberry jam with chunks of strawberries.  amazingly, even though the food looked like greasy diner food, it did not taste greasy!  i think it was the butter that made the difference.  i ate every bite of my breakfast and did not feel overloaded.  service was quick and pleasant although i did have to ask twice for ketchup.  seating will be crowded, but you'll be comfortable enough to enjoy your breakfast.  overall, a very good use of my sunday morning."
_MVSmAYSl4RkgXBg5e8JaQ,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I had a very enjoyable breakfast and TOPH.  Good food, no frills.  We got there about 10 am on a Sunday morning.  Initially, I was surprised it is next to a Motel 6.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed.  There seems to be a shortage of breakfast joints in the valley.  It took about 30 minutes to get a table, but the turnover rate was acceptable considering how many people were ahead of us.  The server came immediately to get our drink orders as we settled in.  I finally decided on the apple pancake and I am glad I did.  Light and fluffy and not too sweet.  I got the junior size and I couldn't even finish that.  Luckily, my dining-mates helped me finish it off.  The regular size would be good for sharing.  Something else I noticed is that the portion size for the other meals did not seem that big.  I was afraid to get the eggs, meat, and pancake combo, but I think even a petite girl like me can handle it.  Some last talking points:  The decor is very retro homey.  The service is good even with the crowd.  Parking is adequate for Scottsdale.  And remember to bring cash."
-Bdw-5H5C4AYSMGnAvmnzw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I really like the atmosphere of Tuck Shop.  It is small, unassuming, and very homey.  Actually, it is so unassuming that I missed it on my first drive around.  It would have helped if I was looking at the right side of the street...  On the other hand, the small plates are not that small.  My friend and I shared the crispy shrimp starter and of course chicken and waffles.  That was enough for dinner for two.  The shrimp dish also included asparagus and cauliflower.  All were lightly fried to go with two dipping sauces.  And then there was the much reviewed chicken and waffles.  The waffles with white cheddar were savory and fit for dinner.  It went great with the crispy fried chicken which had a distinct taste that I can't quite describe...  Together it was a well-executed combination of taste and texture: salty and sweet, soft and crispy.  We went on a Tuesday so they had summer cocktails for $3.  That was a steal considering how strong those drinks were.  There you go: great food, great drinks, great price.  Will definitely go back."
GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I am a meat eater, but when I do have to eat vegetarian, I prefer South Indian cuisine.  Woodlands did not disappoint in that department.  I cannot tell you what I ate since my friend did the ordering, but everything was really good.  We had chick peas, a huge bread that took up most of the table, and ""hamburger buns"" with tasty potato filling.  I am sure I can close my eyes, point at something on the menu and still find the dish enjoyable.  Expect a very casual restaurant where you order at the counter and eat from disposable plates.  This would also be a great place to order take out from."
UdEmYOnk2iJDY9lpEPAlJQ,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"Try the pizza muffins.  They were awesome.  Other than that, I can't say much else about the restaurant.  It is very low key and has a lot of customers from the neighborhood.  This is a good place to knock down a few beers and grab some snacks (i.e. pizza muffins) after work."
m1LOUjVzAAoCS61BTL5i5g,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,1,"I was craving tofu soup one night so I checked this place out based on all the positive reviews.  The tofu was soft and flavorful.  Several other tables ordered their BBQ meats, which also looked/smelled good.  The side dishes were OK but not as many options as other Korean restaurants I have been to.  They have the basics - kimchee, cucumber, radish, sprouts.  Overall, the food was better than I expected for a place in Phoenix.

Now to the bad: the service was absolutely atrocious, if you can call that service at all.  It is a sign of bad service when every table in the restaurant is looking around for someone to help them.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  Another 40 minutes for the food.  The side dishes come with the entrees so don't count on them when you are starving.  The tofu came without rice, which took another 10 minutes.  All this time, you have to flag the waiters multiple times if you want a refill of water or anything else.  Even when they make eye contact, they ignore you.  People actually left their tables to go to the service area and help themselves!  There were no apologies from the waiters for the wait.  They did not even smile.  The very worst part of the meal was paying.  Naturally, we were not able to get our checks at the table, so we lined up at the cashiers table behind another group.  (Keep in mind there is no cashier so we had to wait for a waiter to decide we were worth his time of day.)  When it came our turn to pay, the waiter blew right past us without help us!  Luckily, another waiter finally saw us and got us our check.  I wish we could have given him all the tip.

This may be the only Korean place in Phoenix, but I will hold out for when I go to LA.  Even if they have unfriendly service, at least they are efficient."
wl0QZqAzr1DelslQ02JGCQ,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"Pasties are awesome.  They are freshly baked pockets filled with yummy goodness.  This is not 5-star dining, but it is good comfort food.  I have tried the lamb and mint, bangers and mash, and pesto chicken.  All are tasty, but I really recommend the bangers and mash.  The sausage and mash potatoes went really well together.  Really, you can never go wrong with mash potatoes.  The sitting area is very small, but the bar can be an interesting option since you get to see the cooks at work.  I usually go for lunch, so I cannot speak to their beer selection.  That would certainly go well with a pasty though...  Keep your eyes peeled when going there for the first time.  It is easy to miss!  I usually pull into the parking lot from Hardy Dr off University.  The restaurant is facing Hardy."
biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"By far my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix so far.  (And believe me, I've tried quite a few.)  I have had the lunch buffet here and dinner entrees.  The lunch buffet had a good variety and everything was tasty.  Typical Indian buffet, but done well.  For dinner, I first had to try my standard chicken tikka masala which was creamy with good flavor.  The tandoori chicken was very tender.  Naan was good as well.  Nothing special about the inside of the restaurant.  It just made the top of my list because I like the food the most."
u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"Wow, $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta is an awesome deal.  (Mon and Tues nights)  The wait was long and it was loud inside, but the night was still very enjoyable."
6AgvdkMHPvAGpxs7gdx38Q,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"I came for happy hour and I really like the atmosphere.  The bar area is clean and roomy.  Music was at a good volume to still promote conversation.  Booths were comfortable.  Plus I like bars that have seating all the way around, as opposed to stuck against a wall.  The reason for only 3 stars is the food.  We ordered sliders, stuffed jalapenos, and fried zucchini.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either.  The sliders were a little dry and the jalapenos tasted only like creamed cheese.  Either way, I'll be back for drinks.  Maybe I'll try other dishes and update this post."
8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I'm a sucker for breakfast places so I've been meaning to try Over Easy for a long time.  I finally went there this Sunday morning.  Although the place was packed, the wait was relatively short (~10 mins).  They sat us in a corner of the restaurant behind some sort of partition.  As my friend put it, ""it's like sitting at the kids' table.""  Our area, with 4 tables, is sort of separated from the rest of the restaurant.  Although a little strange, at least it was quieter.  They pack so many tables in the room that I think it may be a fire hazard.

Either way, I ignored the thought of a flaming death and went on to enjoy my food.  The waffle dogs are actually very good.  It's not greasy at all.  The batter had good flavor and the sausage was not too salty or greasy.  The sauce brought just the right amount of sweetness.  Overall, a very balanced dish.  My friend's caramelized banana french toast looked awesome, while my corned beef hash with eggs was also very nicely done.  I would probably prefer a little more corned beef and a little less potato in the dish though.

Overall, I will be back for more breakfast goodness."
EEGajOchS2BIZNvJcPK3uw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"I'm a fan.  This restaurant has a great menu.  I really like the freedom to choose your own tasting menu of 3, 4 or 5 courses.  The pricing for the tasting menus are reasonable and they do not skimp on the portions.  I was stuffed with 3.5 courses (friend and I shared a 3 course and 4 course).  Notable dishes: butterfish crudo, squid ink risotto, pork belly, tempura escargot (the day's special).  Everything tasted good.  Good cocktail choices, although friend did not think they were strong enough.  The dining room, despite being a bit bare, was still comfortable and elegant.  Sound level was just right - you feel the crowd but can still hear the other party."
8rlTOw0IA1TENURMBJpaXw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"A great place to enjoy a meal outside.  The farm was serene and the weather was perfect.  The Farm Monte Cristo, a ""french toast sandwich"" with ham and eggs, was very tasty.  The french toast was melt in your mouth and the over easy eggs added a nice level of texture.  I was a little scared when I saw the sandwich drowning in maple syrup, but was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't overly sweet.  I also liked getting my own coffee as I felt their service was a little slow.  I have been looking for a brunch joint in Phoenix and I think I found a winner.

Oh yeah, this is also a nice place to bring your 4-legged friend if you have one."
IbDCaYwFi-e-nhEmH-FYPA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"I usually order from the happy hour menu.  My favorites are the spicy tuna roll and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno.  The fish has been super fresh every time I went.  The prices are decent, especially with the happy hour discount.  Not much to say about the decor.  The inside seating is comfortable and not as tacky as typical mall joints.  The patio is always packed so go early on busy nights."
Tw3miGKZHtmxmaQZIYFRrA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"Very good pizza crust- light and chewy.  I do not think you can go wrong with any of the pizzas.  Some favorites: Casanova, manifesto, margherita.  Also, the meatball trio appetizer with crispy polenta is a must have.  Tasty meatballs combined with some crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside polenta.  Prices are decent.  The wine coolers are interesting though, at $8, are a bit overpriced.  Cute mini booths seating inside and a decent outdoor seating area.  I am a fan of Upward Projects and they have not disappointed me yet."
EB0vzUuimM2nRXND5VJkIw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"They have an all you can eat sushi special for $19.95.  The sushi was good, but nothing too special.  It was still an enjoyable experience for $20.  The service is OK.  The waiters weren't very friendly and they can be hard to find at times.  I have also been there for lunch.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.  I had the udon which had a good broth and chewy noodles -- just the way I like it.  It did take over half an hour for me to get my food.  They apologized but did not give an explanation.  (This only happened once)  I think it is worth it to try this place out.  Good food at a reasonable price.  I just hope they improve their speed/service."
EcRL1BpBvvQ5LnzgtFr8Gw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"The restaurant was nearly empty when my friend and I went for dinner and wine on a Tuesday night.  It must be the recession...  We each got the suggested three dishes.  They are not at all small compared to other tapas places.  We had the fried goat cheese, butternut squash ravioli, braised short rib, sea scallops, ahi tuna, and clams.  They have a big wine list.  I am not a wine aficionado, but I enjoyed my glass.  The wait was experienced and coursed out our food for us.  For dessert, we had the creme brulee tasting spoons which was awesome.  Overall, a great meal with great service in a nicely decorated restaurant.  More people should go!"
-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"Ditto to all the positive reviews out there.  This place rocks.  The outside actually isn't THAT bad, but yes, I would hesitate to go in if it weren't for all the fantastic reviews on yelp.  Once inside, it is just as all the pretty yelp pictures depict: a clean and bright dining room with colorful tables and chairs.  My friend and I ordered the mixed seafood cocktail and the shrimp culichi.  Both were super tasty, as were the complimentary ceviche tostadas.  The culichi sauce was so good that I had to stop myself from drinking it.  The seafood cocktail was very refreshing - just what is needed during the Phoenix summer.  It had shrimp, oysters, clams, abalone, calamari, and octopus.  Almost all the seafood was fresh and sweet, and the dish was huge.  The only critique is I can do without the clams.  They are the tiny canned ones instead of the fresh ones like I had in the cocktails in Mexico.  Service was really good as well.  Overall, this was a very pleasant experience.  I will be back and I am telling everyone I know about this new find."
ad0LjmuXhUGBxTSkve5LZA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"This is great when you are in the mood for something different.  As with any family-run hole in the wall, service can be slow, so be prepared.  What the staff lacked in speed, they made up for in charm and smiles.  The food was good, but nothing that wowed me.  I had the pierogis while my friend had swedish meatballs.  Both dishes were tasty, as were the side dishes.  One thing that was disappointing was that the food was a a little cold (lukewarm) when it came out.  Maybe the chef or the staff was having an off day.  The restaurant itself is bright and clean.  I will go back again when I feel like eating outside the box."
l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"Let's admit it: this place is neither Chinese nor Mexican.  Not that I have a problem with that.  I just see it as another Panda Express or Baja Fresh - good ole American fast food.  I have been here twice and the food has been good both times.  I have now tried: jade red chicken, emerald chicken, machaca, carnitas, cuban black beans, refried beans, and pork fried rice.  My favorites are the jade red chicken and pork fried rice.  On my second visit, the food was a little salty, but again, this is American fast food.  The snickerdoodle cookie is also a nice touch.  I need to be sure to make it one day for their volcano cookie.  Portions are big enough to have leftovers for another meal.  This is granted that I always pick quesadilla for one of my combo choices.  Service has been good on both visits even though all the workers seem a little young.  They were friendly, helped with the menu, and gave samples for first timers.  I have to admit, $10 for a combo + drink is high for a fast food joint, but somehow, I know I will be going back.  Oh yeah, for $10, they can do better than plastic lawn chairs and tables."
g-I48SaHtdIGR5ZEoVeNFw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,I have to give them one extra star because I do really enjoy their ramen.
IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,3,"It is pricey, I admit.  But I really like the ambiance and the white sangria.  When eating at Chelsea's Kitchen, it feels like you are eating in a vineyard or spa... or somewhere more remote than Phoenix.  It is tucked in a quiet street surrounded by tree's and grass.  I've been here twice; once sitting inside, once outside.  Both options are great because you can eat without staring out at a parking lot.  Beware when sitting outside that leaves can potentially fall in your food.  But that is the price of sitting outside and I cannot mind that much.  The food was enjoyable on both visits, although again, a little expensive.  Swordfish tacos were grilled perfectly and the homemade tortillas were delicious.  The Del Mar salad was refreshing.  Tasty shrimp and crab although I wish they used something other than iceberg lettuce.  I'm going to keep on going back because the whole restaurant experience is very pleasant.  If they lower the food pricing a little, or give a little more wow factor to warrant the price, then this place will be complete.  3.5 stars"
qJf61TR4Jq9Xph5RiXPS9A,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"This is a cozy coffee shop in a strip mall.  I went for lunch one day and ordered a sweet crepe with nutella, strawberries, and bananas.  It was very good.  In addition to the sweet and savory crepes, you can also create your own with a wide range of fillings.  The coffee was also good.  The service was warm and friendly.  This is a good place to relax and enjoy a sandwich alternative.  The TV didn't seem to fit the rest of the restaurant, although I'm sure sports fans will be happy."
ibkwcLZwaJ1pnPJVaI_-uA,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,2,"I have been here for lunch several times.  Try to get in the door before 12; 11:30 if you can.  I find the service to be acceptable on most occasions, but that can slow down when the place starts packing up.  That goes the same with the food.  The food is good though.  I have tried the yellow curry and the pad thai.  Both were fresh and flavorful.  The yellow curry is one of the best I've had.  It is a good blend of spice and coconut milk.  The price is reasonable - $7 for salad, egg roll, curry and rice.  Not much to say about the decor.  The restaurant can use some sprucing up.  That doesn't bother me since I am just there for a good quick lunch.  I will definitely go back, though I am not sure if I'll put up with the wait.

Update:  Wait is way too long.  Not worth it."
iUYAqWKoBdHqYNMDzOXb9w,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"The evening started with a long drive from Chandler and a 40 minute wait for a table.  (This hole in the wall has 6 tables and one waiter who I assume to be the owner.)  Surprisingly, I did not mind the inconveniences at all.  Probably because of the good company.  Probably because you just cannot be impatient with the little gentleman running around tirelessly to serve all the tables with sincerity and a bit of humor.

I have never had Ecuadorian food before, but I assume this place is authentic.  The food and the decor is what I imagine eating at an Ecuadorian grandmother's house would be.  Every thing that I tasted was terrific.  Some items I tried were the Colombiana soda, shrimp ceviche, fish in banana leaf, and shrimp stew.

Last note, this restaurant is not for the faint of heart.  The wait for food is long, but well worth it.  It warmed my heart when the chef (the gentleman's wife?) came out to thank us for coming and wished us a happy new year.  I will definitely return to try the tamales.  You cannot find this food anywhere else in Phoenix."
0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,5,"Really good food in a cute setting!  I like how the restaurant is set up in little rooms.  (It is a house after all...)  That makes for a more intimate, quieter meal.  The omakase dinner was not available the night I went, so we ordered off the menu.  The hamachi with grapefruit was awesome as were the soft shell shrimp & green papaya slaw (great for snacking with a glass of cold beer).  But the star of the night was definitely the pork belly buns.  Finally, a creative way to eat pork belly!  The soft, white buns complemented the fat from the pork belly very well.  Parking was actually note that bad since the restaurant offers validation for the parking structure next door.  Pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food.  This is an all-around winner.  I can't wait to go back."
0TBTV3q6QXCn9vNhy3Xi2w,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I enjoyed this restaurant very much.  The food was good and tasted very ""homemade"".  I had the chicken, beef, and cabbage.  You can mix and match entrees or try one of their combinations.  There is a lot of flexibility and a lot of choices.  Of course, the main part of the meal is the bread, which is spongy and delicious.  The atmosphere is casual and service is friendly.  I will go back again.  It is good to eat something different once in a while."
AJ8DDFm6QaihAPZI3wFBHw,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"A good place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Tempe Marketplace.  I've tried a few of their teas (always iced).  I find them all incredibly refreshing, especially during the hot summer days.  They brew each cup when you order and even when iced, there is plenty of tea flavor.  I actually never thought I would enjoy tea this much.  The seating, although limited, is comfortable enough to stay and chat with friends.  I always try to make a stop at Tea Infusion when at the marketplace."
wTjvgkUJMVWrYed9mXdQjg,9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A,4,"I like.  This restaurant is very inviting with a bright interior that looks like a fancy barn house.  There is a large outdoor seating area as well.  Fresh pasta is made in the open kitchen.  Upon the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the ravioli filled with pork and mushroom in a light butter sauce.  The lemon zest is a refreshing addition.  For a starter, we also got the chef's board which includes 2 cheeses, 2 meats, and crusty bread.  Overall, the food is tasty.  The wine list is good.  -1 star because I do not like valet parking and the openness of the restaurant means flies are welcome to sample your food at the table..."
MhwAKgF54Rwmm4vkdIb0Lw,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,4,"Fresh ingredients cooked and served warm.

I liked their soft shell shrimp tacos,
and the new bbq Carnita(sp?) tacos.
I liked the texture, seasoning, temperature, harmony of the flavors.

I tried the chopped chicken ranch salad before,
it wasn't too exciting and way over-dressed.

The chips and salsa weren't too great.

I like the interior decoration here."

The tofu and bean dish with brown rice was aright.

I liked the pineapple drink I had.

Wasn't a big fan of the zucchini baked pasta though.
Its long thin sliced zucchini instead of pasta, and the texture just isn't right.

On the pricy side but most of it seems healthy.
I guess I can't have both health and taste."
p9v9Sl2g_ibaajWvO0NjkQ,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,3,"I liked their fried calamari appetizer.
Fresh and crispy.

I had the jambalaya with rice (lunch special)
Its alright, its just sauce and sausage, shrimp, crawfish spread on top of steamed rice.

I would much prefer my rice to be seasoned and fried with the ingredients/sauce but I guess its just a personal preference.

The server was robotic, he hardly ever smiled.
Dr. Build-A-Bot forgot to program his robots to have facial expressions.

I really like the tempura zyaru soba.
I don't think I had up to standard zyaru soba in AZ before till I found this place.
The chicken skewers are really good here too.

The tempura is really fresh (Fried prawn and veggies),

Curry Udon was so and so but I have been spoiled by my own recipies.

Gotta warn you that this place alwasy looks closed, so don't get fooled by the appearance. Always tug on the door before you head back to another eatery : )."

Order Takeout. I call ahead of time when I'm about 15-20 minutes away.
Around 15 bucks for two dishes and rice.

That way the food is fresh and I don't have to wait forever.

They have two menus: chinese style and American style.
I prefer the authentic chinese style though I am not Chinese.

Mapo Tofu is my fav dish here.
Its spicy and minty-cool tingly, a unique flavor I could not find anywhere else."

Holy *** the fat mean looking waitress with the blocky eyebrows will eat you alive, regurgitate, and chew you up and then spit you out.

Stay away.
She's brash, unattentive, and discriminates against certain customers.
She was continuously kissing @$$ to the customers next to us but treating my group of four with disrespect and contempt.
I doesn't feel great to be discriminated against.
As a customer, we're all spending money there, and I think we deserve the service we pay for.

Sirloin steak was small but decent.
Mashed potatos were yummy.

Food came out warm and in a fairly timely manner considering that it was a Sunday night.

My crusted chicken creamy marinara pasta (w/ extra marinara on the side) was excellent.
I don't eat huge portions so it was just right. I didn't need a to go box.

They have huge chunks of chicken breast in there.
It was a little too much for me so I gave it to my man.

I went through the drive-through,
they couldn't hear me very well so told us to go to the first window.
They took our order and were reasonably fast and very friendly.

The taco salad came out to 5 dollars.
Reasonable/ affordable price and the food is VERY filling, and I couldn't finish it. (box it up for later!)

They gave me tons of hot sauce yay.
Fried tortilla shell was very fresh.
Pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, shredded cheddar, chicken.

I got the hot and sour soup which was pretty good.
5.95. Pretty good portion. Split between 3 people.

XO sauce spicy fried rice...
NOT spicy at all. Very bland.
Probably won't get that again.

Assorted veggies plate with rice...
it was okay.
Wasn't the best I ever had but not bad either.

Service was kind of slow, as it took a while to get seated when there was nobody else in the restaurant,
and longer than I would like for them to take my order.

You have to ask for ice waters if you want it otherwise they won't give it to you.
You only get tea :p

They pour your tea for you and serve your soup for you which is kind of nice.

But the food... nothing too special to drive a long way for.

Overall, I don't think I will go again, but I guess its a good place to get to go stuff if you're into that.

I also noticed they do dim sum till 3 PM."

The chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala were EXELLENT.
I had both dishes at Tandoor 1 and 2,
but this place tops all.
Very well seasoned, thick rich and creamy with tasty herbs.
Meat was juicy and just right.

Rice was consistent in texture.

A gal in braids served us. She had a foreign accent and was very awkward by tring to be overly friendly.
but I'm sure she was just trying to be friendly to her patrons lol.
I think she was a n00b, but I realized this place opened not too long ago,
so she's likely still in training.

I asked her for a to go container for my makhani and masala,
and she came out with one of those sandwich containers.
Had to send her back to fetch a soup container bc the sauces will leak and make your car smell like Indian food for days!!

I would say I was impressed with the food.
Not quite San Jose level, but close :)

I would def go back again if I drop by hat side of town.

If it were closer to home and more affordable, I'd eat it EVERY DAY :D"

We sat outdoors.
Nice, spacey, fun hangout atmosphere.

Our waitress was so nice and on top of things.
Her name is Candace (sp?).
She was in charge of our group at the patio.
Very polite, attentive, and friendly.

The sweet potato fries were MUCH better this time.
The cinnamon sugar kind of hurt my teeth fillings but whatever, I like sweet potato fries!

The hummus ... set a fire in my mouth.
it was surprisingly spicy which was unexpected.
Not a fan of spicy hummus, but if you like that kind of stuff, try it.

Pita was fresh and warm.

Bread was thin but hard.
I prefer soft bread but thats just my preference.
The seasoning for bread tho is good stuff.
The pesto and marinara for the bread were especially tasty.

Parking was a struggle, it gets so full on a Friday night.
We had to park at a meter :/ Buh

I liked this place for a late din/ hangout place rather than a lunch place.
Totally dig the cool interior lighting at night.

If only I could find parking more available/accessable, I would totally go again when I'm visiting central Phoenix."

So I sat outdoors.
It was 100+ degrees outside .
It was comfortably cool with the parasols and misters and fans.


The only annoyance sitting outside was the huge disgusting fly that kept charging at my food and landing on it. :(
Sigh. You need to hire a professional fly swatter if you're gonna sit outdoors.
I would want my food too if I were a fly. Its so yummy!

Very fresh pita and hummus. Food comes out warm.
Excellent harmony of taste w/ the fresh cut tomato, hummus, and pita.

I thought the grape in hummus looked tasty so I consumed it whole... only to find out that it was an olive! (it had a huge seed in the middle, followed by an extremely olive-y taste)

I got the southwest style chicken on pita seasoned with cheese.
It was really good. Chicken was a little bit dry but the seasoning was done well.
I liked the taste and texture of tomato, beans, corn, and seasoning that gave this dish its unique flavor.

I ended up having 2 and half meals out of this one dish.
(but then again, I'm a size 00p if that tells you anything)

Would totally go here again.

Nan was overcooked, the bottom side was burnt.

Chicken Tikka Masala: seasoning, texture, and consistency of the dish was excellent.
Chicken was just a tad try but overall, great flavor.
Would be more awesome if they sliced up the chicken into smaller cubes to give flavor consistency.
Recommended esp for ppl who don't like spicy. Its very ""umami"" : )
I enjoy the creamy touch this place gives to it, shich distinguishes this place from other places.

Seasoned rice: came out warm, cooked just right

Samosas Choley: Non-spicy dish.
I eat it with the red sauce (spicy) to add a lili kick.
The exterior was fried crispy just right, and the mashed potato inside were soft and warm.
Beans were very well seasoned and cooked, could tell they put time into it.

Methi Chicken: I tried this dish for the first time and I must admit I like it quite a bit.
Ordered spicy. Have water prepared! (Amy was diligent w/ H20)

I wish I could go to this place every day if I could afford to!"
rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,3,"I had lunch here.

The staff were super friendly.

The food needs improvement.

The lunch specials are 5.95 for a cup of soup, springroll, fried wontons, fried/steamed rice, and your choice of specialty dish (about 10 to choose from).

Flamingo specialty chicken was not too bad. slight hint of peanuts which I like.
Saucy on the outside, some pieces are kind of dry inside.

House special pork (ordered extra spicy)
not spicy at all
the sauce is very soy-saucy and nothing much else.

fried rice... bland.
the fried wontons were soggy and thick (nothing crispy about them at all),

The spring rolls were too yucky for me.
I think it was the seasoning of the stuff inside.

The only good part about my meal was the sweet and sour soup.
I had better soup, but it wasn't too bad."
xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,5,"They will greet you and seat you at a table with utensils.
They will serve you water.

though the quantity is smaller than YC's Grill and the prices are higher,
They don't charge 50 cents for to go boxes like YC's does.

Also, I enjoy the higher quality and greater variety of ingredients.
~*Its really hit or miss depending on what you create*~

My fav :
crab meat + scallops + andoullie sausage + lil bit of ham
cajun seasoning (2 spoons) + ginger seasoning

tofu, spinach, zucchini squash, lil bit of tomato, mushroom, lil bit of bean sprouts, lil bit of potato,

one big container of szechwan sauce, one small container of garlic chili oil

udon noodles,

and hand it over to the grill guy, and he hands you a number.
You stick the number in the holder upper thing at your table.

Takes a big longer than YC's to cook.
but upside is you can go back to your seat and chill, the servers will bring your food to you in a fun looking bowl.

To go boxes are free, so if its too much, get it to go.

there are servers in this place, so expect to spend extra on tips too."

Battered fried calamari was horrible.
Totally missed this time.
Tasted like undercooked flour.
It was surprising bc I really liked this dish last time.
What happened to the chef that cooked the last time :(

BBQ chicken pizza was okay but not as good as I remembered.

Atlantic Roll (salmon wrapped in rice and topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce) was pretty good.

Sweet and sour shrimp was amazing.
It was served in a crunchy shell which I enjoyed munching on w/ the flavorful sauces of the shrimp."

I got a taco salad.
Served in a fried shell.
Laid back cool staff.
I liked it. Relatively big proportion and tasty, fresh ingredients.
I would suggest adding your own toppings to enhance the flavor because it might be a tad bland for the average Jane/Joe."
RQdKieW9hqg898d_S2WwRA,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,4,"Not very authentic, but good in its own way.

I like this place because I don't have to tip.
Walk in, order, get food, eat, walk out, at my own pace w/o servers hovering over me.

I have tried:

The potato croquette. Pretty good.

Tempura Udon. Pretty tasty but a lil too salty afterwards.
Usually the battered fried veggies and shrimp + noodles + the fried flakes fill me up.

Might not be big enough in portion for some ppl though.

Fried California roll : Battered and fried.
tastes good with teriyaki sauce (which is basically sweeetned and thickened soy sauce)

Crunch Roll. Battered fried shrimp, rice, avocado wrapped in nori (seaweed), coated in fried flakes
Pretty good but I'm not a big fan of shrimp to start with.
If you like fried shrimp, go for it.

If you're looking for something authentic and expensive, go to Shimogamo.

This place isn't priced too horribly for what I get, but then again
I'm very petite and I don't eat that much so I usually get one Golden /fried CA roll with a croquette and maybe a Ramune (Soda with a marble stuck in a bottle) and all is digested in a few hours and hunger returns.

If you're an average sized person, might have to order more than one dish to not walk out hungry lol"
1ePxLE7eU4kRoags_ytAAg,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,4,"The only thing I tried here was the vegetarian Taco Salad.
I like the crunchy shell.
Fresh ingredients.
lettuce, dressing, black beans, sour cream, tomato salsa, red salsa, corn.
It fills me up for at least 3-4 hours.
I usually get a to go box for it, but when I'm really hungry I eat the whole thing...
people wow at how such a petite gal could chow down the whole thing.
Its called being hungry.

I really wish they had the smoked chiplote tabasco sauce here cuz it would really go well with my taco salad.

Spicy tofu soup.

Their dduk bokki (spicy rice cakes) are SPICY and yummy.

Yook Gae Jang -- spicy broth, beef, clear noodles, veggies.
Spicy and yummy!

Jja Jang (soy bean paste noodle) and Neng Myun (spicy buckwheat noodle),
first few bites were good but then I got kinda tired of it.

Their sidedishes are well flavored.

Would recommend."

I ordered the spicy lemon grass soup (#15) and Pad Thai.

The service was slow. It took forever (20 min) to get our order in (for two ppl)

The soup was served. the 4.95 portion is big enough for two.
It was pretty good but not Amazing.

The Pad Thai was pretty good, served in a large portion.
I definitely needed a to go box.

I think this is a better lunch place, since they serve warm soup immediately during lunch hours free of charge.

I'll try lunch next time."
FDEm-c3NAXnTVtl-hgzAhA,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,3,"A unique burger joint with a humorous experience.
Didn't go for the food, went for the experience.

I walked in and grabbed a seat at the bar.
The friendly head nurse gives you a admittance bracelet and dresses you in a hospital gown.
There are creepy manequins standing around the restaurant.
The head nurse told me she did shots off one of the guy surgeon manequins LOL.

A really hot waitress dressed in a super tight nurse costume showing lots of cleavage and lots of legs.

Small menu to choose from.
As I don't eat beef, here is what I chose:

1.83 all you can eat fries... cooked in lard
4.55 30 oz butterfat strawberry shake.

The fries are usually fresh cooked and pretty good.
The Shake,... it was very sweet, not the best thing I had but I enjoyed about 2/3 of it and then had to leave it because I was getting headache and dehydration.

I saw my man finish the quadruple bypass (four patties ewww).
He got wheeled out to the car by the head nurse.
His opinion: Very greasy, not the most flavorful.

Friendly service. The staff is all dressed up. and You're required to wear hospital gowns like a patient lol

There's entertaining stuff on the TV, stuff related to their restaurant.
Local culture presented in a fun fashion.

This place is humorous, worth going to for the experience at least once...

but expect to crave some salad or some fruits/veggies afterwards cuz the grease/fat content will make you feel icky."

Once I got an awesome andoulie sausage with seasoned rice.
Another time, I got very bland pasta with way too much grease and very little seasoning.
I guess it all depends on what you order.

Wait times are moderate to long depending on what time you get there.

I like the misters in the waiting area in the summer.

Pretty cool decor, especially the outdoor fountain area.
Kind of nice when the lights turn on."

Its alright, not the best things I have ever had.

Friday 6:55 PM entered the restaurant.
Ordered 7:05 PM.
Orders came out way past 7:40 PM.
The manager was going around apologizing for delays.
We couldn't leave till 8:30 PM.

Our server ""Chad"" was not paying attention and making mistakes that could be avoided.

He brought out a french onion soup instead of clam chowder after the 35+ min wait.

We ate: The portions were small but the quality was above average.

We gave a coupon to Chad.

Chad: ""Seperate checks or all together?""
us: 3 seperate checks please.
Chad: Together, got it.
us: We'd like to split the check between 3 parties please.

He processed our bill and came back.
The coupon was not applied so we flagged him down again.

Chad: ""How was everything guys? Food come out in a timely manner? (dead silence)  Well you're one of the lucky ones"" he said.

No, No, and No. Just because we weren't more vocal like the other customers doesn't mean we were one of the ""lucky"" ones.

Then he came back. The coupon was applied but he had forgotten 2 of our credit cards.
He looked through his apron smock thingy and pulled out the other two credit cards.
""Wow, that looks bad doesn't it?"" he said. No comment, dead silence.

He came back with the receipts and one pen... which didn't work at all.
At this point, we decided to procure another pen on our own and just sign and tip and get out of there.

I had a bad experience and it was rather disappointing. Would not go back for a long time."

What a great place to celebrate my 5 yr data-versary : )

There was no line.
Its our tradition to go to an olive garden just like we did in the beginning

(its their fault we're in love, they started it in 2005 by setting up the mood when we were ""just friends""!)

Our server was so friendly and easy going, he put us at ease and we were able to enjoy the meal.
The team there was attentive, fast, and courteous.

I got a virgin Tangerine Palermo(sp?) b/c I don't drink alcohol.

Its off the menu since a few years ago but if you ask the bartender he will make it for you.
Its the best drink ever.

At first, they did serve me an alcoholic version of it without carding me which I thought was a bit odd since I look twelve.
I took a huge sip in an empty stomach, and yikes it was STRONG and I got buzzed and a mild headache that followed,...

anyways the server fixed it and got me a virgin tangerine palmero(sp?) and apologized.

I got the trio sampler:
stuffed mushrooms
pork ravioli
battered fried calamari.

Dang good stuff, especially the calamari!

I also got the new ""Lasagna Fresco"" (?)
basically stuffed lasagna with plenty yummy cheese and tomato sauce.
I loved this dish.

Minestrone was hot and fresh as usual.

I would totally go back again, even if I got an unintentional buzz."

make sure you check EVERYTHING before you leave with your to go bag.
Most likely, something will be missing.
The customer ahead of me was missing parts of his order too.
Its sad.

The food varies depends on when you go / who makes it.
Inconsistency... sometimes the chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani are excellent,
other times its sad and runny and bland.

Mango lasses are still consistently good.

Hit or miss. I stopped disappointing myself and stopped going."

From my POV:
Pretty chillaxed place.

The food is incredibly greasy if you're into that stuff.

It was pretty different for my taste. (Then again, I'm a VERY picky eater)
I had the mashers and bangers (mashed potato and pork stuffed into a greasy shell like that on a chicken pot pie except richer in fat).
It was so and so. Kind of bland.

Second time around, I had the Italian style one with Salami and other yummy stuff in it.
It was much better than the bland mashers and bangers.

I go here for happy hour.
I really like the viva las vegas roll.
The crab cakes are of good value.
Fried calamari is a bit bland but worth the volume (big)

Off the happy hr menu, my fav is the scallop dynamite roll.
either you love it or hate it. It took me a couple tries to appreciate it.


the desert roll (bananas fried and topped with fruits, w/ a hint of white chocolate chip) was surprisingly good.

Walking around the mall after dinner is pretty relaxing.

Do not get the tempura icecream here.
It was nasty."

The shrimp ceviche is like pico de gallo with shrimp, so I suggest passing on it.  Other appetizers that other diners got looked better, like the hummus trio.

Luckily we found this little gem.  Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling we'll become regulars."

Great salsa and I love that it's authentic Sonoran Mexican food without having to commit to a sit down restaurant.  I do have a little hole in the wall Sonoran Mexican joint that's been in Phoenix for 40 years that is slightly better (if not just because of childhood nostalgia), but to cover my bases all over the rest of the Phoenix Rural/Metro area, Someburros gets my vote."

The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.

The service was fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and funky, and the food is fabulous.  My mom loved the chips and guac.  The guac was nice and limey.  My favorites were the steak in adobo and the chorizo shrimp tacos.  Though it's tapas, you actually get a good bit of food in each item.  My suggestion is to start with 2 plates per person and then build from there.  We over ordered, but it was amazing.
Will definitely be back."

First off, glad to see blue cheese as an option, always a good sign.  Celery and carrots, check.  Good assortment of wings to drums, awesome.  The wings were also a good size with a nice amount of meat on 'em, but not too big.  Best part, the heat was perfect.  Stuck with me for sure, but a good bit of heat while still having great peppery flavor.  Very traditional flavor.  They were nice and crispy, but not overly fried so as to loose some juiciness.  Finally, there was a good bit of sauce on them.  I hate it when there's practically no sauce and I have to ask for an extra side of sauce.  These were coated and just the right amount of sloppy.  Pair that with a good $2 beer and I was a happy girl."

I have been here for lunch (great lunch specials), dinner and take-out (my personal favorite)

good food, good people without the Scottsdale pretense - if you need white linen table clothes, or expect someone to dote on you, forget it here - this is like being in your mother's kitchen - and by the way - Mama's Gravy is available only on Saturday nights (and they sell out of it often)"

This is not entry level pizza - actually has a wide range of ingrediants, types and the pizzas are GIANT.

But not quite high-end pizza such as an Oregano's or other top shelf pizza.. it is what is it.. a solid go-to neighborhood pizza place  - easy take-out, simple parking, no inside seating with a few tables out front (maybe for the lunch crowd)

If you are hungry and you don't want to travel far - go to this place - decent

foods is never prepared the same  - no consistent prep

food is given to you in a basket.. food you will consume.. food you need to live.. a basket.. are you at a A&W fast food place here? or are you paying for food for your body to survive and live? you decide.  who cares about the price? are you some slob that will attack anything in a basket with a beer in front of you (beer is never served cold here.. lukewarm is the best description.. one of the freezers for beer mugs has not been repaired in years...

further, if you sit on the side of the bar furthest away from the door, near the kitchen.. fully expect bugs to crawl up out the coolers onto the bar, at some point of the evening.

staff.. does not want to engage you in any way, shape or form... they want their 20% and they will not talk to you.. this is corporate after all..

btw,,,,, if you drink too much and get a buzz.... don't worry, several of my friends have confirmed that they will call Scottsdale PD on you and report your license plate to the cops to have you arrested for DUI.. (I will give you names if you send me a message)... can't make this stuff up... customer unfriendly as it gets


oh, the patio... yes, your dogs must be kept OUTSIDE the fence. like peasants! not dog friendly here!!

bar, dare you sit at the bar...... unwelcoming and tip 20% or they will do bad things to you... they act like you are not worthy of being served by the great staff... LOL... staff with no experience of actual customer experience.

burgers - grease and never prepared the same
FRIES.. omg.. the fries are kept for hours in a steel bowl in the kitchen and if you are LUckY they might be frest... otherwise LIMP, GREASY and cold
Wings... bad chicken with too much WETNESS is how they actually sell it... they think if you just taste the sauce.. you will never notice how poorly it is prepared for you!!


needless to say, I will never walk in those doors again.

If they call you a regular... you might want to re-consider your role in life..... good luck going here and sooner or later being confronted by SPD!!"

Try their cheese crisps, chili relleno (anyone who likes this dish knows it pretty much sucks most places), Shrimp fajita burrito pollo fundito style... Some of their chicken dishes are not great, as I am not a huge fan of shredded chicken. Opt for the fajita meat instead.

Try hitting this place during dinner time on the weekend, and you will understand why all the locals to sunny slope don't tell anyone about this place. Unfortunately the wait during peak hours sucks, but worth the wait! Parking can suck so just park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant.

I haven't had any of the service issues that others have reported, so I can't speak to that.  The staff has been great time every time I have been there.

If your into french fries you HAVE to get these ! Order the happy hour fries anytime to receive the golden crispy deliciousness sprinkled with seasonings and pecorino cheese, not a big messy pile of goopy cheese fries either, one you can actually pick up and eat without making a mess.  They are served with awesome aioli too so be sure not to miss it.

My staple lunch order here is Fig and prosciutto pizza with butternut squash soup.  The pizza is the perfect balance, sweet fig goat cheese and their house made mozzarella and prosciutto makes everything better right ???   the soup is just a hint of sweet from a bit of cinnamon.

They  have a sausage made for them by Schreiner's( another local company ) It's to die for !!!  They have plenty of Veg only selections too so no worries if you bring a mixed group."

The Happy Hour is amazing here $3 and $ dollar food items and great happy hour drinks.  They feature wine beer and mixed drinks , so everybody will be able to find something here.

On this particular night Jerry was at the bar serving us and he was GREAT.  Never lets your ice tea , water or whatever be empty.  There were 3 of us eating and it was steamed pork dumplings all around.  OMG they are literally the best dumplings in town.  I keep ordering them other places, but they just cant hold a candle to these at PF Chang's.  We also had Orange Peel Chicken and Crispy Green Beans. Everything was excellent and the service was impeccable.

I'm never disappointed here , food, service and great regulars.  If you are in the north valley and just need a bite or need to wait out the traffic or whatever its a great place to hang out."

Bison hot dog,  the nutter,  all the apps. you really cant go wrong here

The beers change all the time so you never get bored. And they have the wine on tap so it's a reasonable price.

The kitchen DOES close an hour before the actual closing time , so be sure to make note of that.

Also, you wouldn't think it but they have a great sunset view from the patio.  Note the sunset time in PHX and don't miss it !!!! Cant think of any other ground level downtown place with a great view ."

They have good salsa, but the chips were terribly greasy.  The cheese crisp was also too greasy, and not that crisp, while the guacamole was okay, but nothing special.  Although the waiter at first brought a hard taco when I had asked for soft, the chicken taco was probably the best part of the meal, with juicy and flavorful chicken.  Valle Luna has been a long-time Valley favorite for Sonoran Mexican food, but it's not quite what it used to be."
K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"Every aspect of The Mission lived up to the Republic's 4.5 star review. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, with the dim lighting of different chandeliers and the lit bar area. Service was wonderful, as well - friendly and prompt. We decided to follow the advice from Seftel's review and skip the overpriced items like guacamole and tacos, instead focusing on The Mission's more unique dishes. We started off with the absolutely amazing almejas al vapor - clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, and more in a delicate but pungent broth with grilled bread to soak it up with. For entrees, the swordfish veracruz and the scallop dish both were fantastic. The Mission fries - sweet potato and regular - were the best I've had in the Valley, topping the sweet potato fries at Delux. Typically, Latin restaurants disappoint where dessert is involved, but The Mission is an exception - the pumpkin bread pudding with scotch, caramel, pomegranate, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was WOW-worthy. I hope this place is here for the long-haul, because we could use more unique restaurants that fill an open niche (in this case, haute Latin American).

TIP 1: Skip the overpriced guacamole, unless you have a party of 4+, and the tiny-portioned tacos.

TIP 2: You might hesitate to order fries at a Latin restaurant, but that would be a mistake. The portion is enough for 4+, and they might possibly be the best fries in the Valley."

They have so many options, but we went with the eggs benedict with turkey sausage and the berry protein pancakes. Both were absolutely delicious - the hollandaise on the benedict was tasty and light, while the turkey sausage was super flavorful with a tiny bit of spice. The berry protein pancakes seem like they'd be too healthy to also be delicious, considering they're made with honey wheat batter and protein flax seed granola, but they're amazingly good...I wish all things so healthy could taste so good. Service was terrific - prompt and friendly. With The Breakfast Club just up the street, Old Town is lucky to have two great breakfast spots!"
z6-reuC5BYf_Rth9gMBfgQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"St. Francis is the kind of place that I believe will define the near future in restaurant trends, an evolution of the post-recession ""new normal,"" if you will. This is about approachable, comforting dishes prepared excellently - food fit for foodies, but not ""foodie food"" - at a moderate price point (entrees $12-25). And it all happens in a cosy, informal atmosphere that feels like a neighborhood hangout, with exposed brick walls, metal tables, a garage door that makes the bar indoor/outdoor when open, and waiters dressed in jeans and t-shirts. The chef comes from LGO Hospitality, and while this is his own venture, you can certainly see their influence here...there are similarities to Postino, Chelsea's Kitchen, and LGO Pizzeria, in the cuisine and especially in the atmosphere.

The romaine hearts salad is the perfect way to start a meal, with a very light but flavorful dressing, a few slices of apple, the most amazingly thick and crispy bacon, and lots of creamy cheddar. You'll see the flatbread being served at a lot of tables, and for good reason. Firstly, because it's wonderful, with a perfect crust and tasty toppings, and secondly, because at $12 it's a steal...enough for an entree (probably with some left over) or as an appetizer for 2-4 people. The scallop special was amazing - perfectly cooked scallops paired with a lemon and caviar beurre blanc sauce and multi-colored cauliflower. The only mild disappointment was dessert, and less-so because of taste than because of misleading description. The warm sticky toffee pudding was delicious, but it was a little too dry to be a sticky toffee pudding...more like a toffee cake. It was also a little on the small side.

Service was excellent, the vibe was great, and the price was right for the quality of food...it's not your weekly hangout, but it's not special occasion dining either. My prediction is that 2010 will be all about restaurants like this."
rIcEm0o8Xk413HWD4-f2QA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"This is a great neighborhood spot and the perfect place to grab a bite before or after a movie at the Harkins Cine Capri.  The restaurant is bright, casual, and modern, the owners are friendly, and the service is quick and attentive.  They serve salads, pizzas, sandwiches, and pastas - you order at the counter and then they bring it out to your table.  Some of their salads are better than others  - the Caesar is pretty good, while the grilled chicken salad was mediocre and overpriced (at $12), with just warm lettuce, shredded carrots, and dry chicken in too much peanut sauce.  Their pizzas are very tasty, with a delicate, chewy crust, plenty of sweet, delicious sauce, and very fresh cheese and other ingredients.  My only complaint is that the crust underneath towards the center of their pizzas is too soggy - I love thin crust, but it shouldn't collapse and make all your ingredients slide off when you try to take a piece.  Cafepino has become one of my go-to spots for a reliably good, quick meal."
NPiLy71qqXzb45k9eQOgCQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Lovely little place with friendly service and good food. Nothing blew me away, but nothing disappointed either. Prices were a little high, IMO, for what you get. For instance, the California spinach salad with chicken added cost $12 - not outrageous, but quite high for lunch at a neighborhood place with just 4 ingredients. The dressing was a little too oily, too. The Savannah chicken salad sandwich was a more reasonable deal, for $8, but their multigrain bread looked and tasted more like white bread than anything. The noodle kugel option for a side was a nice surprise...don't see that on too many menus...and was pretty good, although a little on the sweet side and a little too runny. This is the kind of place I wouldn't rush back to but would definitely not object if someone else wanted to go here."
IiwgHkUbBt9Ha25H4dUtkw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Amazingly neat place to check out, and a fun place to take visitors, too, as it's a unique representation of our city's Mexican culture and community. PRM is full of all kinds of Mexican/Latin goodies, from agua frescas to baked goods, prepared meals like tacos and ceviches to groceries and a wide selection of specialty produce. If you decide to dine here, the shrimp ceviche tostada is great. I also really enjoyed the quesadilla...so good 'n' buttery! The watermelon agua fresca was very refreshing, but my advice with all agua frescas would be to stick with the small size because, at least in my opinion, you get a little sick of the sweetness and the same flavor after a while."

Nowhere to sit indoors, so grab it to go when the weather's hot, or enjoy the outdoor patio when it's cool. Having Lux next door for gourmet coffee, pastries, and more is a big plus."
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"3.5 stars for Matt's. While you can tell that their dishes are made with care and they use quality ingredients (local, when possible), I feel that this place is a little overhyped. The menu is basically glorified Americana diner breakfasts and, while they do it well and with a charm and authenticity rarely found in Phoenix, it's a little boring. Would it hurt to offer some variations of pancakes and waffles?! The pancakes were good - fluffy with a touch of sweetness - but nothing to phone home about. The standout was their breakfast special of the day - a three egg scramble with white cheddar, hot links, and a pepper they described as in between a green chile and a jalapeno. Proably the best egg breakfast dish I've had in a while. As good as it was, though, I can't imagine waiting a half hour or more for it. Luckily we went on a weekday at a good time and had no wait, but I've heard people wait for hours for this food, and it's just not that spectacular. My other complaint is that, for a place with ""Big Breakfast"" in the name, the portions are no larger than what you'd get at Denny's or IHOP. I'm not a proponent of oversized portions at all - I believe it's wasteful and contributes greatly to our nation's obesity epidemic - but, come on, ya gotta live up to your name. Not only that, but some of the prices are a little steep. $2.50 for the tiniest glass of OJ you've ever seen. Service is great, the place is cute, and the food is good, but the media attention and national recognition on Food Network have overhyped Matt's from what it truly is - a friendly neighborhood spot to grab a good, fresh, hearty breakfast made with care."
FogTa-wmjhVnJCoTiaxvZA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Yet another hit from the LGO Group. I've never been to the Postino in the Arcadia neighborhood but wanted to try this one for lunch since it's near my work. They have a great location on Central Ave. and the decor is simple but stylish. The lunch crowd was very eclectic, but I assume the place skews a little younger and more happening for the nighttime scene. Although it's called ""Postino Winecafe,"" don't let the name fool you into thinking food comes second. I absolutely LOVE the bruschetta, with about 8 different options of topping. For $12.75, you get to pick four, and it's enough for an appetizer for 2-4 or an entree for one. We went with the apple and brie, smoked salmon, roasted red peppers and goat cheese, and ricotta cheese with pistachios and dates. All of them were super tasty, but the apple and brie was a standout. We also shared the prosciutto panini, with brie and fig jam on focaccia bread...so delicious! This is a great hangout for the young urban CenPho crowd, and come fall that big patio will be packed!"
aD-YA02i2xAqLBDon1tzIQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Noca is tucked into a Safeway strip center, in between Keegan's and Great Clips, but don't let the location fool you - this is a terrific restaurant. The space is small and simple, but with a nice open kitchen and bustling with the chatter of a mixed age group of patrons. We were initially given a table in the back, near the service station and looking into the back kitchen/cleaning area, but asked for a different table and were given one in the middle of the dining room. The service was spotty - my only complaint about our experience. We had to ask for bread, after we had already placed our appetizer orders and then noticed the table next to us getting bread right after they sat down. Then, after our soup, we noticed the table next to us getting an amuse bouche, so when we asked the waiter about it, he said, ""Oh, you didn't get your amuse bouche?"" They brought it right out, as an intermezzo, and apologized. After that, the service was much better. Now to the food, the most important part:

-Amuse bouche of corned beef with garlic crouton...gimme a whole sandwich of that!
-Sunchoke soup...wonderful
-Intermezzo of chestnut soup...fantastic - would have liked a whole bowl of it
-Papardelle with lamb ragout...delicious
-Intermezzo of baby beet salad...just okay - the blue cheese overpowered all the other ingredients too much
-Scallops with artichoke risotto...terrific
-Intermezzo of cotton candy...cotton candy fits in at a place like SimonLA (for those who are familiar), with it's upscale comfort food and junk food desserts, but it feels odd and pointlessly kitschy at Noca
-Donuts with three dipping sauces...donut hole desserts in upscale restaurants are now somewhat cliched, and these were far from the best I've had; they also seemed a bit pricey, at $8 for four donut holes

While Noca isn't as innovative as other Valley restaurants like Binkley's and Kai, it has deservedly earned much critical acclaim and local buzz with their gourmet basics. However, they need to do a couple things before Noca joins the upper echelon of Valley restaurants. First, they need to perfect service, so that they're not forgetting bread and amuse bouches; and second, they need to change their dessert menu. When the feature of the dessert menu is chocolate chip cookies and a vanilla malt shake, you know you don't have a great dessert menu. They need a skilled pastry chef to craft some more complex and unique desserts. Nothing on the dessert menu made me say, ""Wow, I want that!"" In any case, I'll definitely be back to try Noca again!"
yFUvKpW66cNsYXD6inDsog,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"Simple THE BEST ravioli in the state of Arizona. Hands down. Homemade deliciousness in a cream and tomato sauce. The other food is all very good, as well, but it's the ravioli that draws me back again and again. Prices are on the higher side - you don't get great value for basics like apps, salads, etc. - but for the handmade pastas, totally worth it, especially since they come with soup or salad! Service is always attentive and friendly."

-- Roasted red pepper and mozzarella bruschetta was very good...my only complaint is that it could have used a little more balsamic, and the mozz was a little greasy. I personally would have done a mix of mozz and goat cheese but, hey, I'm not the chef.
-- Chopped salad was okay...chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, olive, and feta in a nice, light dressing
-- Pasta alla vodka...highly recommended! tortellini stuffed with ricotta in a spicy tomato cream sauce, with basil, crispy prosciutto, and garlic for that special added kick of flavor that makes this dish unique
-- Chicken limone...your standard picatta, but with two huge breasts of chicken and a side of yummy pasta (although the pasta was a little cold)
-- ""Dolchinos""...small servings of desserts...we tried the key lime pie, which was yummy, but it was the bananas foster creme brulee that evoked a WOW!
All-in-all, I'm very pleasantly surprised by this chain restaurant. Lovely dining room, attentive service, and great food at moderate prices (figure $25-30 per person)."

While it wasn't quite as authentic as a place I was recently turned onto in Downtown LA, it was still very tasty  and fresh.  A cup of hot tea and a bowl of pho is always wonderful on a cold winter day!  At $8, it's enough for two to share, or it can be two meals for one person!  We don't exactly have a lot of independent ethnic restaurants in this area, so it's nice to have Tea Light Cafe serving up yummy Vietnamese food - hopefully people will continue to support it."
eTmy0-h4tTEpfbDVAue0MA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,Authentic Chicago-style thin crust pizza with the best pizza sauce in town--just the right hint of sweetness. Decent salads too. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Can't ask for much more from a neighborhood pizzeria!
OZqAZkjhV_nyHsbnKaD1WQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Christo's has been one of my favorites for many years - my dad used to take me there when I'd go to the office with him as a little kid (I think they still have some of the same waiters as back then!). It's not the finest Italian food in the city, but it's consistently very good. I always get the same thing - halibut in a lemon, butter, garlic sauce with a side order of fettuccini alfredo. Halibut is not on the menu, but they always have it as a special (with different sauces) and they'll make it however you like it. Their entrees are very reasonably priced, and come with a salad with a great mustard dressing...however, they tend to have a heavy hand with the dressing, so you might want to ask for it on the side, or ask for light dressing. The service is friendly and the atmosphere at lunch is ""business casual""...while it's a white tablecloth kind of place, you'll find people dressed in everything from jeans to suits. And it's not unusual to spot a governor or mayor here."
BGGQOJQTQerEQu0kHbT_UQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.

Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.

Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food."
siXCBrVFOXicbM2R-33-8w,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"I really loved the atmosphere at The Grind - they did a nice job designing the small space, with the exception of the TVs behind the glass covering that catches the glare from the sun outside. We sat at the bar to eat and received friendly service from the bartender, although not the most prompt...it seemed like the whole staff was a bit frenzied and in over their heads, even the manager. I like that they have Anchor Steam and Stella on tap, but I wouldn't pay $3 for the PBR. What I don't like is the lack of milkshake options...gourmet burger places should have gourmet sides and gourmet shakes, not just the standard chocolate/vanilla/strawberry I can get at McDonald's for half the price.

Two of us ordered the peppercorn burger, sweet potato fritters, and coal roasted veggies to share. A couple minutes later, the bartender told us they were out of the fritters. That's a major strike - when you have this few items on the menu (just 4 side dishes), how can you be out of something like that?! With disappointment, we ordered the scalloped potatoes instead. I would give the sides here 4 stars but the burger just 3 stars. The beef itself in the burger wasn't that flavorful and was a little overcooked. The scalloped potatoes were very rich and delicious, and the green beens were really flavorful. I'd stop in here for a drink, if I was in the neighborhood, but for burgers, I'd go to Delux instead."
QYIhMNwxXejDoCr-F1BxDg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"The Yelp description for 3 stars fits this place pretty well...it's A-OK. It's not the best Thai in the Valley, and certainly not worth driving out of your way for, but if you feel like Thai and you're in Tempe, it's good. A word of warning: no alcohol is served...so if you're craving a Thai beer, this isn't the place for you. The combo appetizer is very good, as is the panang. The pad thai is just okay. Service is friendly, but a little slow on refilling drinks, to the point where you need to walk up to the counter to ask for more water."
-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"This is a really nice, unique neighborhood place - the decor reminded me of South Beach a little. The menu is nice, although the pricing is a little odd. The $5 goat cheese and red pepper marmalade quesadilla was delicious but tiny. Meanwhile, we got a bigpiece of pound cake for dessert that was just $2.50. And my ginger lemonade was $3. I'd say both food items should have been about $4, and the drink $2. The paninis are priced right - $7 for a nice sandwich with a small side salad of mixed greens. All-in-all, the food gets a solid 4 stars. The service, however, is their weak point. It took 10 minutes for our server to come over to take drink orders and another 10 minutes for her to come back to take food orders...not a place to get in and out of quickly. Sapna is a great addition to this Grand Ave. area - now they just need to hone their service."
XFQbescZxNRAb2U-NwdLlg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"My review is really just for the salads, because they're the only reason I go here every once-in-a-while -- they're pretty good and pretty hard to mess up (I usually go for the citrus chicken salad).  Everything else here is mediocre at best, and those kind of portions are really a shame, in my opinion.  No one needs that much food - it just contributes to the obesity epidemic and gives Americans a reputation for being wasteful.  The decor is hideous, so close your eyes while you eat, unless you're into the whole Old West mining theme."
ms7cmWkPiSBDTnz-1sv2kQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Very cool, spacious dining room decked out in black and red. Friendly servers, although a little slow. Delicious food - the chips are fresh and warm, and the three different salsas are all amazing; the grilled peach salad was more like canned peach salad, but still was light, tasty, and refreshing on a hot summer day; and the jumbo grilled burrito...wow! There are so many good authentic Mexican places in this area, but this burrito would probably top them all! The passion fruit slaw and masa-thing on the side were equally wonderful...so much flavor! Like its siblings Fez and Switch, Ticoz offers terrific food in a hip but casual atmosphere perfect for a work lunch or night out."
Ly2ShApiomYZwKehwb7eRA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Another good neighborhood sushi place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.  Miso soup, sunomono, and Las Vegas Roll were very good; Arizona roll, just okay; house salad, not so good.  Ambiance is...well, there isn't really any. Service is great.  I'd go here again if in the area, but there are equally good sushi places all over the Valley."
0d6kx6Jlocw77y1J9nbqMA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"I must say that this place was nothing like I expected when I read that we finally had an authentic Parisian patisserie in the Valley, owned by two REAL PARISIANS!  I envisioned a warm, casual shop with fresh croissants, danishes, cakes, etc. like the places I experienced in Paris.  Needless to say my expectations were way off - I should have been thinking less mom-and-pop Paris bake-shop and more Payard Patisserie, with delicate pastry works of art in a stark, hip space.  We shared two desserts, a blueberry something-or-other and a lemon tart, and both were fantastic!  So while it's a little more upscale 8th Arrondissement than casual 5th, it's still authentic Paris in Scottsdale, and who doesn't love that?!"
Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"I have mixed emotions about this Pomo review. On the night we dined there, the restaurant was practically chaos. We had reservations but were told we'd have a short wait, so we waited near the bar area. That's when we noticed that the restaurant's A/C didn't seem to be working at all...not good in any place, let alone a restaurant with an open kitchen with a pizza oven. Honestly, they shouldn't have even opened for service that day without functioning A/C. That said, the restaurant was packed...it has HORRIBLE acoustics, so the decibel level was off the charts. There seemed to be an army of staff running all over the place - one unlucky guy dropped a whole platter of glassware. It was NOT a good start.

After about 20 minutes, we were seated at a table in the front of the restaurant that was unbearably hot. The manager came over, knowing that we were a little irked, and mentioned that the back side of the restaurant was much cooler and he had a table about to leave. He offered to buy us drinks, which was very nice. I ordered their Italian beer on tap, listed on the menu, and was told they didn't have any draft beers at the moment...uh oh, could it be more of a comedy of errors?!

However, after we eventually moved to the cooler back side of the restaurant, the rest of our experience was much better. We had a delightful server and the food, while a bit overpriced, was all great. The bruschetta app was tasty, but on the small side for $6. The mango salad was light but flavorful, with a great dressing. The Diavolo pizza was excellent...I've not been to Naples, but this sure seemed like the real deal. For dessert, the sliced pineapple was a nice, refreshing way to end the meal, although it should have been accompanied by something a little sweeter and more substantial than lemon sorbetto...acidic and acidic don't pair well together, whereas a coconut or similar gelato would have been perfect with the pineapple.

I don't think I'll return back here soon, as I would to Humble Pie or The Parlor...and it's certainly not about to knock Pizzeria Bianco off it's throne. But assuming they get the kinks smoothed out, I think they'll offer a unique dining experience to the Valley that's worth at least one visit."
M9gwHW1oIiIqjdT76yOBDA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"J&G is SO close to getting five stars from me, and I'm pretty sure they will once they've completely worked out all the kinks. For starters, they have a stunning dining room -- stark, modern, and hip while also dark, classy, and elegant. This isn't your grandfather's steakhouse, but it's not some Scottsdale scene-over-substance place either. From the fifth floor of the Phoenician, they also boast gorgeous views of the city. But on to the most important part...the food. Everything we had was spectacular -- sweet corn ravioli, chopped salad, filet mignon, crispy spiced onions, and exotic fruit salad for dessert. My main complaint is that nothing came out very hot - the ravioli, steak, and onions were all just warm. But I'll deal with my steak being just warm when it's this amazing - not an ounce or gristle or fat, just pure tender beef, like butter, perfectly seasoned. And at $28 for 8 oz. or $36 for 12, the best steak in the city might also be the most reasonably priced! Another minor issue is the service - while our waiter couldn't have been more friendly and helpful (kindly offering to take back our chopped salad and remake it with a different dressing when we didn't like the dressing it came with), some of the courses took quite a while to come out. I'm all for fine dining restaurants pacing a leisurely meal, but this was beyond leisurely...it was slow, about 2.5 hours total. All said, this was a wonderful experience, and I plan to be back MANY more times for the amazing steaks and more. And why not, when the price is right?!"
Dqz6wpV1Jg9b2djjMamjQA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Very fresh, good quality, tasty, and authentic Thai food. Tom kha gai, pad thai, and panang chicken were all great. Nothing was so much better than what I've had at Malee's, Thai Rama, Thai Elephant, Thai Hut, etc., but nothing was worse, either. Service was very good. Atmosphere is sort of tacky generic Asian. Overall, nothing worth making a special trip for, but a very good neighborhood Thai restaurant for those who live in this area."
-bMZCfTK7fxFaURynKpBMA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"This place is the best Mexican seafood I've found in Phoenix! Delicious chips with two kinds of salsas, plus they bring complimentary shrimp ceviche tostadas that are superb! The Camarones Culichi, one of their specialty dishes, is OUTRAGEOUSLY good! You'll finish all the shrimp and then want to sop up the rest of the sauce with their fresh homemade tortillas! My only complaint is that the beans served with the dish were cold. If you go for lunch and aren't a huge eater, be sure to ask for the lunch portions, which are half the price listed on the menu! The atmosphere is wonderfully festive, much nicer than you'd expect from the outside, and the service is prompt and friendly. There's good reason for the numerous plaques and articles of praise adorning the walls (including a 5 star review from Seftel back in '04)!"
yZAGhlsrmupLbrgdKm6reg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Don & Charlie's is your anti-Scottsdale-Scene place, a Chicago-based steakhouse decked out in sports memorabilia and filled with mostly middle-to-older-aged regulars. The food is consistently good, which is why we usually make it to Don & Charlie's for various birthdays or holidays. This time, it was Father's Day. Two words for you: chopped liver. It's fantastic. You could make an entire meal out of it, as it really is the best thing going here. However, then you'd miss out on their shrimp de jonghe, also the very best incarnation of this dish you'll find in the Valley. Their steaks are good but not great - nowhere near the quality of places like Mastro's or J&G - but the price is right when you factor in the sides they come with. The sides are very good - the salad with creamy garlic dressing, the cole slaw, and the potatoes au gratin are winners. The dessert selection isn't particularly exciting, but they dishes they do offer are good, from a light and tart key lime pie to a sweet, creamy banana cream pie."
BqnxN4hHahZ-zZGXDDGLsg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"BLT Steak is one of three new ""modern steakhouses"" that have taken over the dining rooms of Scottsdale resorts. While I lament the loss of local gourmet restaurants in exchange for somewhat corporate ""celebrity chef"" ones, I was very pleased by the other two, J&G at the Phoenician and Bourbon Steak at the Fairmont (although my experience there was limited to dessert). We decided to give BLT Steak a try, while they're running their $50 blackboard menu 3-course special (it's actually 3.5 courses--app, entree, side, and dessert).

Things started nicely with a chicken liver amuse, on toasted baguette. Then they bring out their famous popovers--which are spectacular-- and you're almost ready to call it a night! We shared the crabcake app from the regular menu, the white asparagus app, dover sole entree, and broccolini side from the blackboard menu, and the potatoes au gratin side from the regular menu. Nothing was tremendously impressive. Don't get me wrong--everything was very good--but nothing made us say, ""WOW!"" And at prices like these, I need a few ""WOW!"" moments. They were out of the peach melba cake for dessert so they brought us the other two off the blackboard menu, which was very nice. Unfortunately, neither one impressed. In fact, I found the apricot phyllo tart with mint creme to be a terrible mix of flavors.

Service was wonderful, and the dining room is contemporary and casually stylish...definitely your Gen X / Gen Y steakhouse. But the prices are just too high for food that's merely ""very good."" It might not be fair to judge a steakhouse without trying the steaks, but Seftel seemed to suggest that they aren't the star here, compared to other Valley steakhouses. If that's true, it's even more reason to head to J&G, Bourbon Steak, or Mastro's instead of BLT Steak. We left saying, ""Better than BLT Burger, in Las Vegas."" But see my review of BLT Burger and you'll see that's not saying too much."
C8D_GU9cDDjbOJfCaGXxDQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Like all of Sam Fox's restaurants, Culinary Dropout intrigued me enough to get me in the door to try it and pleased me at first with its nice atmosphere and friendly service, but then didn't meet expectations when it came to food and value. He seems to have a recurring pattern of great concepts with mediocre execution. The $9 grilled cheese sliders were pretty bad, with yellow American cheese like the packaged grocery store slices. For just $6, you can have a MUCH better grilled cheese sandwich at former Fox restaurant, Chloe's Corner (at Kierland Commons), and it's greater quantity, too. The $12 smoked chicken salad was quite yummy but very small. You could get equally as good salads at Chloe's Corner for $7.50. Or if you're going to spend $12, at least go across the way at Fashion Square to Grand Lux Café and get one that's big enough for a whole meal! The $7 salted carmel pot de creme was also just so-so. I almost NEVER leave any dessert uneaten, but this was just very one-dimensional and too sweet. I won't be rushing back here any time soon, but I'll probably be suckered in to trying some of Fox's other new places. I guess I'm just an optimist."
5SEwzlWlrxSVyZx3IgXwLg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"We decided to check out Marcella's for their supposedly great happy hour, but obviously the Republic critics had a far different experience than we did. Service was hit or miss, literally...our first server went MIA, and 15 minutes later we finally had another server come help us. The manager later came to see how things were going, which was nice, but didn't offer to do anything to make up for the poor service (not that I ever expect it, but as a marketer, I know the immense power of small gestures to turn a negative experience into a more positive one). The bigger issue is that the food here is just mediocre bordering on bad. You'll be hard pressed to find too many big rings of calamari in the calamari appetizer - more like little balls of mostly breading - and the fried zucchini slices that come with are so thin that they crumble when you try to get them on your fork. Not only that, but I wasn't sure which of the two dipping sauces I disliked the least - the runny, bland aioli or the tastes-like-canned marinara. The veal meatball was just totally mushy and came with the same awful marinara. The apple salad was the only item that showed some promise, if it hadn't been terribly over-dressed, and at $7, it's certainly a great value. Even the decor here is bad - tacky, tacky Italian...like something you'd find at Epcot. I can't really see anything good this place has going for it. If you're in Fashion Square, your better happy hour options are Z'Tejas and Kona Grill, or even Yard House."
IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"What a great experience I had at Chelsea's Kitchen!  We had to wait 15 minutes, even with a reservation, which would have irked me a little bit if the Cardinals game hadn't been on TV in the bar area. The atmosphere is very nice, with real fireplaces both in the dining room and out on their beautiful patio.  It has the feel of a casual, slightly upscale gathering place for couples, friends, and families alike. Once we were seated, our server couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. We shared a small LGO caesar salad, identical to the one served at LGO (as the name implies) and thus delicious! For entrees, we shared the swordfish tacos and the short ribs with the over-easy egg on top. The swordfish tacos are, as promised, the best fish tacos I've had in the Valley, filled with big pieces of grilled swordfish, a little cabbage and tomatoes, guacamole, a slightly sweet sauce, and a great salsa on the side. The short rib dish is another one of their specialties.  The short ribs were tender and served with a yummy red wine jus, over mashed potatoes and veggies. I'm not sure what the egg on top adds to the dish (other than calories and cholesterol), and I personally would do without it next time, but you gotta give them credit for pairing such ingredients and having the dish still be great. I'm glad we tried Chelsea's Kitchen, and I'll be back many more times for their great food at reasonable prices, all with friendly service and in a cool atmosphere."
RU2VtVZG8to-XVEHD-2qag,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Like everyone else, I went in with the pre-disposition of disappointment compared to Palette (I'm still sad I never got to try their breakfast), and while Local Breeze has lost some of the charm of the former restaurant, it's nice to see another unique independent take this space. And I must say, the food is pretty good. The LB Paradise Toss salad burst with the flavors of spiced chicken, mango, red peppers, and cilantro and came with a light, refreshing lime vinaigrette...the perfect salad for a hot summer day. The Coca-Cola ham sandwich was really flavorful too, although the toasted bread was a little too well done. For dessert, our server recommended the key lime pie, only to come back and inform us they were out. However, I can't imagine it being much better than their rum cake...you get quite a hefty portion for $5. Service is decent - our server had to check with the kitchen when asked what kind of lettuce our salad came with - but the people are friendly, and the cookies they bring with the check are a thoughtful touch. So I guess I'll stop dwelling on the Palette past and embrace the future with Local Breeze."
R2fjCEHav7HqIhfBRDWQ9Q,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"My Dad and I decided to try Talavera after they extended their Restaurant Week deal through the end of the year.  We arrived for a late dinner and were received by the hostess, who was thoroughly un-friendly, especially by Four Seasons standards.  Then it took over 5 minutes for our server to come over and tell us she'd be back soon to take our order.  We were a little worried that the service would be totally abysmal, but we ended up with a different server after that, but she was terrific.  We ordered the 3-course meal for $39 per person, and she nicely agreed to substitute the chocolate dessert, as chocolate keeps me up late at night.  Our first course was a salmon pastrami, and I think we were both curious to see what that meant, but it was just like it sounds - smoked salmon, peppered around the edges, and they curled it, stood it up, filled it with fresh crab meat, and drizzled citrus vinaigrette on the plate, with a side of haricots vert.  The main course was a lamb chop, with a side of a grain similar to cous-cous, although they called it something else.  The lamb was juicy and the sauce complemented it very well.  Finally, for dessert, we had the creme brulee with fresh berries and the apple pie.  Both were delicious, but my only complaint would be that the creme brulee was a little too sweet, and the dough on the pie a little too salty.  All-in-all, it was a very nice meal, in a beautiful setting.  The dining room is elegant, with a Southwestern flair, a long outdoor fire, and views overlooking the mountains and the whole city below.  It might not be one of the most progressive or acclaimed culinary destinations in the Valley, but this special pricing is a good deal for what you get, and the food is great."
TZl7YBuzo5awZP8QJDLg_w,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"This place has been around forever, but I can't really understand why. The restaurant is run down. The service was pretty awful - it took forever to place our order, we sat with empty water glasses, then there were missing dishes, messed up dishes, we needed silverware, etc. And from the moment you try the salsa that tastes like canned tomato sauce, you'll know that the food just isn't good. There are many better options for Mexican food around this area."
wOIh5bvOsSv1zcRrX6A8Lw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"After reading positive reviews from Phoenix Mag, here on Yelp, and from a friend, we decided to give Avalon a shot. Despite the fact that OpenTable showed they had open reservations 8:00, we arrived just before 8 to be told it'd be a 5-10 minute wait. 15 minutes later, we asked the hostess what was going on, and she said, ""Oh, okay, I can seat you now"" and walked us back to a dining room with about 5 open tables. I understand that restaurants seat based on server and not based on open tables, but making patrons wait with so many open tables is just bad business. As it would turn out, waiting is something we'd do a lot that evening.

After sitting down, we waited 5 minutes for the waiter to come over to ask about drinks. He brought our waters and then disappeared for 15 minutes. We had to flag down one of the hostesses to ask for some bread and to get our server so we could order. In the mean time, I noticed that another table sat down and waited about 10 minutes for their server to even show up at all, but at least once she did she got them drinks and bread immediately.

The first thing we noticed on the menu was that the chef had changed (it turns out the original chef left right after the new year). Once we did get our server, we ordered the organic greens salad, shrimp fettuccine carbonara, lamb osso bucco, and side of sauteed spinach.

The salad was a joke. For $8 you get about 8 bites of salad (the dressing is nice, though), plus they split ours in the kitchen, so we each were served a plate with about 4 bites. I don't care if it cost $3, you shouldn't serve anything that ridiculously small. The carbonara was quite good, with the added touch of lemon lightening up a typically heavier dish, but the osso bucco was pretty bland (although here the portion was huge). The spinach side was as small as the salad. Typically sides are enough for two to share, so if they're going to serve these petite sides, they should explain that to diners. The best dish was actually the dessert, banana bread pudding, which makes sense since the original chef was the former pastry chef for Sam Fox's restaurants.

After our dessert, we waited 15 more minutes from the time we asked for the check until our waiter returned. He apologized and said they were short staffed, but it was clearly just an effort to try to get a better tip.

The service was really a deal breaker for this place. And all of these problems could have been avoided if the hostess had just explained that they were short staffed and what the wait for a table (and good service) would actually be. That said, even if the service was perfect, I don't think the food was as exceptional as what I've had elsewhere for the same price, with the exception of the dessert. I don't see this place lasting long if these problems continue"
0PMKMyfX1j7Nc4esk1RaMg,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Humble Pie fills the nitch of the high-quality neighborhood pizza joint and bar for Desert Ridge, much like LGO Pizzeria in Arcadia and Patsy Grimaldi's in DC Ranch. I dined at the original location once and must say I liked that space better, but I'm thrilled to have this location closer to home. The chilled green bean app is wonderful - prepared just like they do in France, with a light mustard sauce. Their salads are great, too. I've had the delicious chopped salad with turkey, salami, and cheese, and on my most recent visit, I had the awesome new summer strawberry gorgonzola salad. Of course, a place called Humble Pie must serve up some terrific pizzas, and they sure do, in many unique varieties. There are some more gourmet choices, like the prosciutto and pear and the shrimp pizza, which I had on my latest visit. The shrimp had a lightly sweet taste to it that really complimented the savory cheese. My only complaint is that the dough was slightly undercooked...it looked white as snow. There's nothing too gourmet about the pizza with Schreiner's sausage, but it's amazing! Their tomato sauce is great and you can't go wrong with top-quality sausage from a local producer. And when done right (unlike my last visit), the crust is golden brown, soft and crispy at the same time, and has a hint of sweetness. This place is offering some killer specials right now -- from nightly specials (like Tuesday's free half salad or app) to the $8.95 lunch special to their coupons -- so take advantage of the savings and enjoy some great food!"

The dining room is simple, really just an extension of the Biltmore lobby in architecture and decor. The service is friendly, but slow. The server showed up quickly to take our drink orders, but then it took 10 minutes before we got our waters and another 10 minutes for our server to come back to take our food order. On his recommendation, we tried the baked Alaska. It was okay - nothing special. There was way to much of the marshmallow flavored meringue, which was sickeningly sweet, and very little of the sponge cake. I might give Wright's a try for dinner or brunch someday, but I'm in no hurry after this mediocre dessert."

If you're in the area craving some Mex, I wouldn't tell you to avoid it, but I won't be rushing back here any time soon...they're not much better than some Mexican restaurant chains."
OtGSQQzV7uF8XPAsNIh7Bw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"Elements is truly one of the Valley's fine dining gems, thanks to the amazing food from Chef Beau MacMillan and the spectacular setting. They recently underwent a multi-million renovation - I never saw the dining room before, but now it's sleek and modern. It almost feels a bit Japanese minimalist, but this wisely puts the focus on the food and the gorgeous views. If you try Elements for dinner, make sure you get there before the sun goes down to take in the sunset and mountain views and then the lights of nighttime. Service is friendly and helpful, although not quite as refined and attentive as you might expect in a restaurant of this caliber.

To start, they brought us rolls with hummus dip that were so good, I was afraid I'd fill up on that alone. For an appetizer, two of us shared the short rib ravioli, which was to die for! It's only one ravioli, but it's quite large. The combination of flavors is amazing, and the short rib inside is so tender. For entrees, we had the scallops and the flat iron steak - both dishes were exceptional! The three jumbo scallops were perfectly seared, tender and sweet, and came served over a lobster pea risotto and with a mustard sauce. The flat iron was also perfectly cooked, super tender for what can be a rougher cut of meat, and with a nice, mildly sweet hoisin sauce. We finished by sharing the pineapple upside down cake, with coconut gelato. The desserts are small portions, and we probably could have used a second, but then we might not have been able to enjoy the delectable chocolate chip cookies they brought out with the the bill. I always find that a nice touch and it's something that costs a restaurant very little but leaves a wonderful, lasting final impression.

Elements may not be THE best restaurant in town, but as long as Chef MacMillan keeps devoting his time and energy here (with the help of his staff), in addition to his many ""celebrity chef"" duties, it will remain ONE OF the best. And those views don't hurt, either."
5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Wonderful service and extremely reasonable prices, but the food is just okay. I might be back when I have more time to try the apple pancake (it takes 25 minutes). The owners of this place are apparently from Chicago, so they should be pretty familiar with the famous Walker Bros. apple pancake and hopefully use the same recipe, although that doesn't mean it will be as good."
EbGlh6Vd17jKVMmSPcGBUQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Our experience at Calistro started out a little shaky, when the server first informed us that the fish of the day was sold out (at 8pm on a slow Tuesday night) and then, after we asked how the Alaskan scallop entree was prepared, informed us that the chef couldn't get the scallops from Alaska that day and had instead gotten them from Japan (not a big deal, but still, it seems like they have some issues with supply). However, the rest of the experience was totally delightful.

The hummus starter was great - what really makes the dish is their flatbread, cooked in their wood oven with some oil and garlic. The summer roll starter was equally great, a mix of very strong flavors that almost overpowered the tuna a little too much, but it was so tasty I didn't care.

The salmon entree was everything you can ask from this kind of California cuisine. The fish was incredibly fresh, perfectly cooked, and lightly seasoned, sitting on a bed of vegetables and a delicious lemon sauce. I also had a side of the wood roasted seasonal vegetables, which would compliment any entree nicely.

When it comes to dessert, I often like to pick the most unique dish, one I've never or rarely seen elsewhere, and Calistro's dairy-free rice pudding certainly fit that bill. It was the ideal refreshing dessert to end a nice meal with.

I really like what they have going here, with a ""farm-to-table"" approach that focuses on the ingredients and bringing out the best in them. It's no Chez Panisse, but it's nice to see some Valley restaurants heading more in that direction. Prices are reasonable (no entrees over $30;  sides and desserts around $5-6), service is terrific, and the subtle decor keeps the focus on the food. They're located in a new, half-empty DC Ranch strip center that many people probably don't even know exists. In addition, the space is huge and their rent probably matches. Given those factors, I wouldn't be surprised if they're not around long, but that would be a shame. Hopefully, Valley diners will seek Calistro out to give it a try!"
VzSUgIOcyO7JmTwYDnyivQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,5,"Not only is this the best Flo's location, it's the best Chinese restaurant I've found in the city. In fact, it's the best Chinese restaurant I've found outside of San Francisco. The BEST hot and sour soup - the perfect balance of the spicy and sour elements. Everything is extremely fresh and they use high quality ingredients. The service is prompt and friendly, too, so Flo's is a great overall experience."
-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Bananas foster shake -- amazing!
Truffle fries -- very good! But they really should allow diners to do ""half and half"" fries to try different kinds or they should make half-size orders...the server said they were ""working on it,"" whatever that means.
Zinburger -- meh. I definitely enjoy the burgers at Delux more, and for $10, you should get a superb burger. The beef was good quality but not incredibly flavorful, and the burger overall was bland. Also, the bun was a little too soft to support the burger patty and toppings.

Service was good - although the hostess underestimated our wait time quite a bit, she apologized, and then our server was great. The atmosphere is just okay - plain and modern, almost corporate feeling... a bit like Sauce, another Fox place. The bar area is nice, though.

If I was in the Biltmore area and craving a burger, I'd stop at Zinburger, but I wouldn't make any special trips there."
LuZKuFPkQE35MhYmFoL7-g,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,2,"I'm not sure this Hollywood import will be around too long. First, the atmosphere. If you've seen the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where the first 25 Degrees is, it's very similar in decor. It's very LA trendy and would be perfect for a lounge, but then you think about the fact that this is a burger joint, and suddenly the posh decor just feels like they're trying too hard. I'll take Delux's casually modern and hip for my burger place any day over dark LA lounge-y. Second, the service is just not good. They bring your onion rings/fries right after you order, but then your burgers don't come for 10 minutes, by which time your rings/fries are cold. They also neglected to bring any side plates for us to share the rings/fries. We asked for the sauce for the burger on the side, and when she brought it out and we asked for the sauce, she said, ""Oh, I think they put it on top."" The burger was also supposed to come with Thousand Island, which she forgot and we had to ask for. Then, we had to ask for water after my glass sat empty for 10 minutes with about 6 different servers walking by and not noticing. Now, about the food. It's just not good. The onion rings were greasy and the batter fell right off. The sweet potato fries were soft, mushy, and under-seasoned. The garlic aioli on my burger was basically mayo with a dash of garlic powder. The burgers are flavorful but not nearly as good as Delux, the gold standard for Valley burger joints, IMO. The worst part of all this is that they're overpriced and nickel-and-dime you for everything. Burgers start at $9 and then it's $1.50/cheese, $1/topping, $1/sauce. They even charge for dipping sauce for your fries (other than ketchup, obviously). Finally, there's this misstep by the owners: when you're designing a high-end burger place with a lounge-like atmosphere, a place for people to grab a bite before or after the clubs/bars, you probably shouldn't have the kitchen open up to the dining room so that people leave reeking of the smell of burger and fries grease. I don't know about others, but I prefer not to have the smell of burger grease all over my clothes and in my hair after dinner if I'm going out somewhere after. It's a classic case of a paradox between positioning and actuality.

Save your money and head to Delux instead for a better atmosphere, better service, and MUCH better food."
RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"There's not much I can say about ZuZu's happy hour that hasn't already been said - it's one of the very best values in town! $3 appetizers, cocktails, glasses of wine, and beers mean that you can leave here either really full or really hammered (or a bit of each) for under $20, including tax and tip! All the apps are a good deal and most are very tasty - the only one I wasn't fond of was the terribly over-salted chicken wings. The cocktails aren't weak like you'd expect for $3, and the wine selection is decent. The beers are the only thing that aren't a good deal, in my opinion - you can find domestics for $3 at many places even when it's not happy hour. After a long day or work (or play), you really will be happy after an hour at ZuZu."
R1oI13c1oNxE91wkjYDeow,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"Pure Sushi typifies what a high-end sushi place should be...a mix of a simple, casually-upscale atmosphere (including a terrific patio area), lounge music that sets the mood without drowning out conversation, good service and, of course, excellent sushi (and other menu items). It's definitely on the high-end of the price spectrum, and sure you could get sushi as good for half the price elsewhere, but it's not your weekly sushi place...you come here for the vibe. Pure is a great choice for a date or nice night out with friends or family. I'm thrilled to have this place in my neighborhood and hope it sees continued success (they must be doing something right, if they opened a second location in Old Town)."
yUh85ZlAq_zZ9-rRlvCgcA,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Good, unique sandwiches at reasonable prices. I had the Improv, which is like cold Thanksgiving dinner on a baguette: turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, lettuce, mayo. The little cookies that come with the sandwiches are fantastic, too. Yes, the sandwiches are pretty stuffed and the fillings often fall out, but better that then an underfilled sandwich that's all bread, like Subway, right?!"
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"The Parlor is, indeed, as good as everyone says it is. The space is very nice - modern but casual, dimmed lighting, good music. Service is friendly and helpful. And the food rivals other upscale/gourmet pizzerias like Humble Pie and Cibo. The large field greens salad at first seemed a little pricey for the size, but was totally worth it for the quality and amazing flavor. I'd be back for that even if the pizza sucked, which is surely does not. The smokey pizza was very unique and wonderful - the olive tapenade really added such a nice touch - and I LOVE their crust, thin throughout the middle, crisp but chewy on the edges. I can't wait to go back to work my way through their menu!"
oMBNvB6tHlwW3UwGBYqljw,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,4,"I had very high expectations for this place after all the Yelp praise, expectations Blue Fin mostly lived up to. The place itself is nothing special, although they do have a big patio for when the weather is cooler. However, the food is very good and super cheap. Their daily special is quite the bargain - $6.75 gets you chicken teriyaki (all white meat, if you prefer, at no extra cost) over white rice with a side salad and two mini spring rolls. The spring rolls were very good, although a little greasy. The salad was good, although a little warm. The chicken teriyaki was great, but not your traditional teriyaki. Unlike most places, it seems like they cook the chicken in the sauce so that it's coated with the teriyaki flavor, rather tossing the chicken with the sauce or pouring sauce on top before serving it. That makes it a little more dry than I'm used to, but it also gives it a nice smokiness. Their sauce is a little less sweet than my Americanized Japanese palate is used to (Yoshi's, for instance, has a much sweeter sauce), but it's definitely more authentic. The best part of this place is the service - the people here are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and helpful."
VRC7J-ahI4em9ddhihxq5w,lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w,3,"Pizza A Metro, a tiny restaurant in a tiny strip mall, is definitely better than your Olive Gardens, but how the heck it has a 4.5 star average rating on here I don't know. It's just not that exceptional. It started out bad when the water tasted like dish soap. The bread and caponata is the best thing they have going here. Our $10 caprese was cheap mozzarella on pale tomatoes...for that price, I expect burrata mozz on beefsteak tomatoes. The pasta primavera ($13)  was very good, in a nice light garlic white wine sauce. Chicken marsala ($15) was good, not great, as was the accompanying pasta alfredo. Everything's about $2-3 overpriced, given that this is just a slightly above average neighborhood place. I won't be rushing back, but I would be okay going here if someone else suggested it."
GGecutXeoEVlYKoxVo2WPA,FZ9kP5I_L86ySiDrr4fwyA,3,"Mixteca was OK. Kind of a cross between Baja Fresh and Robertos. The quesadilla was decent and the beef tacos were good also, just nothing spectacular. I would go up the street to ""Carumbas"" for something better.

They're seemingly open 10 hours a month and when u r lucky enough to get in there u feel like u gotta hurry up and eat so the next group can get in there. It's like something straight off of Seinfeld.
The pizza was good. I like there toppings. Not the usual fair, more of a step up. However as I drove away it took a while to get the black soot taste out of my mouth from the bottom of the pizza.
Great food but too much of a hassle to return."

""The Thumb"" as it's called is a hidden gem, well at least it was until ""DDD"" showed up. I had the brisket sandwich and shoe-string fries. It was excellent!  I will definitely swing by whenever I'm on this side of town. I kind of wish I lived near this place so I could drop by all the time. Then again my waist is probably glad I don't.

The chicken was decent but the proportions were small, especially compared to the pictures on the menu. The chicken was a little greasy but I could live with that if everything else was good. Also, their signature sauce was bland, I switched to their only other choice, honey mustard.
All in all not worth the effort.  Too expensive for too little. Go to Shanes Shack instead."

But the sandwich, although it was tasty, it didn't have much meat on it!! Especially for $6.59 for a ten incher. I felt like I had eaten a six inch sub with double bread. If I ever come back I guess I'd have to spring for double meat. They did however have ""Tasty Cakes"" just like back East. You can't beet a good ""Butterscotch Krimpet""!"

eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg,FZ9kP5I_L86ySiDrr4fwyA,5,This place delivers on great Mexican food!  Not Mexican/American food that u get at every other place.

I haven't eaten at every Mexican restaurant yet but so far this is my favorite.  Woot indeed.

We sat down and the waiter told about the wood fired oven that ran at 900 degrees. He said it only took 1 minute to cook a pizza.  We got the shrimp & Calamari app. It was excellent. I got the meat lovers pizza (they had a fancy Italian name for it). The toppings were good but overall I'd have to say it was just ok. My friend's pizza was the same way. They should have left it in a little longer!  You just don't expect a pie from a 900 degree brick oven to not be crispy, this was closer to doughy. All in all, pretty store, average pizza.
I'd rather go to Pizza A Metro whose building is less than desirable but has excellent pizza. That's just me."
LXheNwqZPoXuXNNeP1sNew,FZ9kP5I_L86ySiDrr4fwyA,3,"Pizza was average. They do what a lot of places do,  they put your freshly cooked, crispy pizza directly on a plate or in a box and It proceeds to get soggy,  especially in the middle. Then when I went to pick up a slice,  the first half of the toppings fell off!  I wouldn't recommend the pizza. The toppings were decent (not great) and the sauce was ""so-so"".
The Calamari on the other hand was really good. A little expensive at $9.99 but really good.
I would go back for happy hour,  i just wouldn't order a pizza."

maBe6J_QSeYlAa1YNkAyVA,ADO8dCEIKKL28YZ5g0WSaQ,3,It's good! We didn't really like the chili cheese dogs but loved the Chicago dogs. The have no jalapeños here and that is important to me on a good hot dog. Or at least having the option.
A26EdvXPLzDXWg0AYVAdAA,ADO8dCEIKKL28YZ5g0WSaQ,4,We have been here multiple times and always get the raw oysters. We usually always sit at the bar and always get great service.

Not everything is organic or natural, but they have a decent selection and use pretty good ingredients.  I really seek out good organic spots, hard to find, True Food is pretty good.

My Top Picks:
Beverage: Medicine Man Elixir
Salad: Greek Chopped w/ Chicken
Sandwich: Columbia River Salmon w/ lime & avocado
Entree:  Spaghetti Squash Casserole
Sides:  Farro!!  (It's awesome, sweet with dates.)

Usually busy around lunch, call ahead and put your name on the list!  But even if you don't, there's plenty of room, and they turn tables quick, so you can get in and out in under an hour if you need to.

They are the official catering restaurant of the Phx Suns.  They must like it, because i was there for lunch this Friday and Grant Hill walked in.

Good spot for lunch in the Biltmore!"

Short wait is well worth it.
Horchata is amazing
The Mahi Mahi Burro might change your life... if i wasnt already in a relationship with the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus from Pita Jungle, i might actually try to make love with this burrito.

Everything about this place is great.  Eat here... if you don't, you are probably crazy... maybe you are the dude at Circle K that is always talking to himself by the dumpster...  That dude creeps me out a little bit.    So, i guess the moral here is:  Eat at La Condessa, so you don't end up talking to a dumpster.  That is all."

Do you know how much landfill that is per person?

The food is okay, but there is nothing healthy or fresh about styrofoam.

i wont be returning."

The Cabo Blanco roll is very good for a fusion type roll.  Mexican flair on your sushi roll?!  Ole!

It's not the cheapest, but who the hell is looking for cheap sushi?  Honestly people... Do you really want the cheapest possible RAW fish? Think that through for a second...  Right, i thought not.

The Biltmore location is convenient.  The decor is pretty cool.  The crowd is far better than the Scottsdale location.  I've never had a problem with the service and i've been there at least a half dozen times & i'm sure i'll end up there again for lunch sometime soon.   Give it a shot!"

Tomorrow will be one of those days when i dash out of bed... why? Because by noon, i will be at Oreganos stuffing my face with a Veggie Wedgie & Sweet Potato fries.  As a grown up, It's the little things in life that get me out of bed.  (Though, that swimming & sunbathing MILF might also still do it too.)

I've never had the pizza at Oregano's... in fact, since i have had the Veggie Wedgie, I may never have anything else at Oregano's.

FirWX-Ep5203TsdiGgShKg,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,5,"Once upon a time there was a restaurant named Vig. It lived in Arcadia.  It wanted to be cool, but was only half cool because it was constantly infiltrated by the evil clan of douche bags named Scottsdalians.  Then one day Vig met a better neighborhood called Cenpho/Uptown.  They fell in love and made a new Vig in a beautiful mid-century mod Bank in Uptown.  This new Vig was about a zillion times cooler.  Proof that sequels can be better than the original.  (Please see Back to the Future 2, Empire Strikes Back, or Evil Dead 2 for more confirmation of this.)

Vig Uptown has an awesome Bocce Ball court in the restaurant.  The food is all good... Ask Juan Schwartz.   The drinks are all well poured.  The bar staff is excellent... They have Tito's handmade vodka in stock and its very well priced.  The crowd is way cooler and the valet's are always on point.  I am a regular at the Vig Uptown, you probably should be too.

Oh, and if you live in the neighborhood, the Vig Rig will pick you up and take you home.  He works on tips only, so leave the ride at home and tip the Vig Rig instead of the valet... SO worth it.

PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,3,"Friday Night... 10 PM... FEZ on Central... Will it live up to the hype?!  Only time will tell.

We are seated and I asked the waitress what craft beers they have. She said Shock Top.  Oh shoot me in the face.  Shock Top is Budweiser's answer to Blue Moon... Blue Moon is made by Coors... neither are a Craft Brew, sister.  Then she rattled off the rest of her beer menu.  Umm... yeah, so the short answer would have been ""we dont have any craft brews""   Also acceptable would have been: ""good beer?! Why bother?!""  Or even:  ""In case you didn't notice on the way in, we serve our ketchup in metal ramekins. This is a FANCY place, so have a Miller Lite with your burger.""  Alright sugar, what kind of bourbon do you have?  She says: ummm.  I say, ""Makers Mark, Knob Creek... and what else? perhaps Woodford Reserve?""  She says, i dont know about those I will check, i know we have Jack Daniels.  Holy mother of God... Jack is not Bourbon.  Jack is Tennessee Whiskey... But great news, they have Woodford...

Should i just keep it simple and order a burbon and ginger?  Oh no, it's Friday, this is FEZ on Central.  My next move is a bold one...  I order an Old Fashioned.  My Old Fashioned was made well, not perfect, but pretty close.  That is nearly an impossible drink to get right because everyone that orders an Old Fashioned seems to have a different take on the ""right"" way to make one.  I think it was pretty darn good.

I ordered a chicken sandwich and the lady ordered a burger... So lady like of you daaaahling.  The food arrived and it was pretty tasty.  No complaints, nothing to rave about, just some food.


Are you ready for some groundbreaking news?  Something that no one has yelped yet?  I know why FEZ chose this location on Central...

That's right, I know the secret reason.  And i know at first they thought  ""it might be a good idea to tint the windows, especially on the south side, to create a nice ambiance like so many other restaurants""...

Once you get there, you too will know why they didn't.  The people that own FEZ saw something beautiful, something that would create a one-of-kind dining experience.  What is that spark of magic?  What keeps you coming back to FEZ??   ... It's the super bright glow of White, Purple and Blue FedEx Kinkos Office in your eyes as you dine.  WOW!  What a spectacular sight.   Eating at FEZ is like staring at a purple and blue sun for 30 min.

When you leave, not only does the sweet flavor of too-much-garlic on your fries linger on your tongue... but the FedEx vistas are etched in your eyes for hours!  It's as if you didn't listen to your 3rd grade teacher and you just stared at a lunar eclipse for 5 min.  Oh, Mrs. Rosenbaum, how right you were, i should have made that little shoe box trick to look at the eclipse!  Then i could take it to FEZ so that i can watch people make copies and surf for porno while i eat!  So wise... so wise you are Mrs. Rosenbaum.

So hop on down to FEZ for an awesome time!   It's RadTastic!"
Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,3,"If people watching was a sport... id be an all star.

RnR is a great space to practice my peoplewatchin skills.  The patio is the only place to be.  Inside is just so so. On the patio you get a good mix of things to look at:

* Old Town regulars (People walking around this joint are pretty much Arizona's version of Jersey Shore.)
* Then you get your out of town dudes who stopped here after 18 holes and are now trying to nail 18 hoes.  Stop dude, your Titleist hat does nothing for these bitches... you need your GTL and blowout hair. Duh.
*  Then theres the bullit biker bar across the street. Thank goodness you put straight pipes and ape hangers on your 86 Harley, otherwise i might not have noticed how freaking awesome you are!  Keep the ZZ Top thing going, it really works for you Grizzly Adams.

The food is pretty tasty, the drinks arent bad.  They carry Effin vodka, many places dont, so thats a bonus.

First time i was here, someone at the bar asked if RnR was owned by the same people that own the Vig. Bartender said: no, but we get that question all the time.  Its similar in some ways, but wasnt sure why. Last time i was there, i figured it out!  The sink in the mens room is exactly the same as the one in Vig uptown... Its not yer average sink... orange, on a slant, very mod.  It stands out.   VIOLA!"
pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,3,"After living 2 blocks away for over a year, i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out.  Got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night... 2.5 hour wait.  (To be expected, but still pretty ridiculous.)

Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.

Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.

The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place.

We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.

I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.

Is it good, yes.
Is it worth the wait, nope."
k1c_bC3DK6mKg797vH1T8w,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,4,"Sometimes you have to listen to an album 3 times before you decide if you like it, love it or loathe it.... For this reason, i'm really trying to resist the temptation to review a spot after just one visit.  This weekend i hit Beckett's for the third time.

Everyone is raving about Beckett's and with fair reason, it's pretty good.  But let's drill down a bit further and see if it's really all it's cracked up to be.

Apps:
* Brussels Sprouts are good, but i think it's just a trendy item to toss onto your menu these days.
* The enchiladas are alright, but they don't ""wow"" anyone.  let's face it... this just isn't the place for enchiladas in the PHX.
* What is wrong with this: ""beckett's original grilled cheese with pancetta (aka bacon)""  [Hint: ""aka""] Pancetta is not Bacon.  Pancetta, like bacon, is also made from pork belly,  But pancetta is rolled and cured, bacon is smoked. The flavor is decidedly different.

Mains:
* The short ribs are great... but then again, i never met a short rib that i didnt like.  I'm a sucker for short ribs on a menu.
* Chicken & Dumplings... major let down.  (They were out of short ribs, so i asked the server for a reco.)  Dumplings were pretty uneventful.  Chicken was tender, but dude... its chicken.
*  Tasted the Osso Buco and it was pretty tasty.

Cocktails and Beer:
Drinks are well poured and fairly inventive.  Not too shabby.
Beer list is so so... some 4peaks and a Stella.  nothing really exciting.

Dessert:
i *love* the hot/cold combo, so i'll practically make love to anything ""a la mode""   ....naturally the poached pear & blueberry cobbler with ice cream was on my list.   It was about 6000 degrees and you couldnt really taste it.  Also, the icecream was tiny and you need more for the cobbler.

However, the chocolate covered bacon (note: not pancetta, so they clearly know the difference, they just think you are dumb when you read the apps menu.) and PB s'mores were to die for!

Seriously... this desert is creative, delicious and hands down the best $5 you'll spend all night.

Bottom line is... Beckett's is pretty good grub, nice ambiance (for a strip mall) and a pretty good menu.  The food isnt amaaaaaaaazing, but it's worth checking out.  If you do anything, come for the s'mores.

3.6 stars.... okay fiiiiiiiine... 4."
_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,2,"Dear reader.... Before you decide if this place is great... think about what else you consider great.  When you were 17 and you took a date to Olive Garden, okay, you get a pass.  BUT, if you ever ever ever went on a date to Outback, or Red Lobster... just stop right now.  You will think this place is just amaaaaazing.  So come out, enjoy their food and on the way home jump out into traffic. (Please do that behind me, so as not to make me late to work.)

Okay, that said... This place struggles from an identity crisis.  Rokerij, who are you appealing to?  The fools that think that this is a classy joint because their previous best date was to Applebees?  OR are you a really good place?  This place should not have a $12 chicken sandwich with fries on the same menu as a $43 steak.  Choose one direction and stick with it.

I called up at 6pm on a Saturday, first available reservation was for 9pm.  This is a good sign.  I take the reservation and then went for a hair cut at Urban Hair... see my other review, they rule.

We get to Rokerij at 830ish.  I walk in the door, and apologize to the staff who are clearly at a waiter station.  We must have walked in the side door.  Whoops!   No, thats the front.  Wait, what?  A friggin computer screen and some silverware, thats the front?  No no, it cant be... oh yes.  Yes, this is phoenix.  Yes, this is the front.  Okay, okay... im cool... whatever.  We will be downtstairs having a drink.

The bar downstairs is okay.  Some 50 yr old dude trying to flirt with a 20something girl.   Standard.   We have martinis.  Not bad, the bartender made it okay.  Chopin vodka.  He didnt really know what to do with the vermouth, but it was okay.

I chat with my friend, we are sitting on a couch, its pretty fun so far.  A server comes down and says, ""your table is ready""  Cool.  We stand up.  She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.  We wait.... finally i walk over to her.  AH HEM... should we just go upstairs?  She turns  ""yep, i said it was ready.""  Oooooh no.  You had better walk my ass right up to my table.  Nope, i can already tell the service is going to be abysmal.

We walk upstairs.  We wait there for almost 5 min.  Then i grab a bus boy and in broken espanol, i ask him... neccecitamos una mesa... ya dig?  He starts wiping down a table.  I ask my date... why the hell do we have reservations again?  Then as we are being seated, a hostess girl says, ""oh your table is over here""  WELLL princess, thanks so much for telling me that 10 min ago....  and we sit.

The waitress comes over and says ""what can i get ya?""  Excuse me Maude... what is this a diner?  Can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners?  I ask her what her name is... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall.  She gets the hint.  I hate my decision to come here.  We order more martinis... Vodka might make this better.

We order some specials... i get meat, lots of it.  The food is very good, though pricey.  Im still annoyed that there is a $10 cheeseburger on the menu.  Dont get me wrong, i love a PBR and a Burger... just not what i was expecting after all of the reviews i read.

When the time comes to order dessert, i think to myself... seriously, lets just stop at starbucks.  We get our check.

The bottom line.  This place has good food, but is not a fancy joint.  If people said, its a decent bar with good food, i would say: ""heck yes, 4 stars, just needs some better service.""  But they think they are classy, and so does yelp... its not.  Frankly, It shouldnt have anything on the menu over $27.  The service is friggin dreadful.  A half drunk toddler could manage this place better.

That is all..."

Came by for a cocktail and an appetizer. Sat at the outside bar and got great service!   The baked goat cheese appetizer was warm & delicious.  Had a well made martini and the lady had a tasty Almond Margarita.  Cool decor, i love the glass cube window booth in the front, very mod.  The crowd was great.  Full house and a good mixed crowd of all ages & types... everyone was really friendly & having a good time.

The only complaint we had was that the dinner menu wasnt too extensive.  Only about 6 options and nothing really caught our eye.  We ended up just having cocktails for a bit and then took off for somewhere else.  Overall... another cool spot in CenPho.  I'll definitely be back for drinks afterwork sometime soon.

Update: Came back and had the Salmon over red quinoa.  It was excellent.  Also put back a few good brews. Dogfish Head 90 min IPA is always a favorite. The bar manager knows quite a bit about the wine and beer that he carries. Nice Job St. Fran."
C8D_GU9cDDjbOJfCaGXxDQ,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,3,"Though we only came for dessert... from the decor, to the beer list, to the Lou Reed quote on the menu, for an FRC joint... Culinary Dropout is pretty good.

I'd wanted to try this for spot for a while and this Friday we decided to head over from the Biltmore area and stop into CD around midnight for cocktails & some dessert.

The decor is pretty funky, awesome oversized chandeliers, cool chairs & tables & great purple wall across from the bar.  At midnight there was still a 30 min wait for a table for 2.  We scored a little table outside and a couple couch seats.  Nice.

Granted... the location in scottsdale lends itself to a barrage of douchebaggery in and around the restaurant, but you cant expect much more when going out around here, so no surprises.

We were pleasantly surprised when looking at the beverage list.  They had a pretty good craft brew & import beer list, both on tap and in bottles.  They also broke down their specialty cocktails by liquor which was a nice touch.

Being a bit of a bloody mary snob, i had to try the Bacon infused vodka Bloody mary.  Normally, this isnt the time of day for this drink, but had to give it a shot.  It's nothing to write home about.  The infused vodka is good, but the it wasnt even served with Olives, i had to order them extra.  Weak Bloody Mary... very disappointing.

The food menu looks pretty good.  No matter what waist widening fare you're in the mood for... from burgers, to pasta, to ribs; you can find your comfort fare at CD.  We came for something sweet and the server suggested the Salted Caramel Custard or the Apple Monkey Bread.  I'm a sucker for the Hot/Cold combo, so we went for the Monkey Bread. It's made-to-order so prepare to wait 15 min for it.  It's basically like an apple cinnamon roll with vanilla ice cream... pretty delicious.

Overall... if you can put up with the Scottsdale crowd, Culinary is worth trying at least once.  However, if you are in the market for comfort food, there are better places to try (Chelsea's Kitchen!).  On second thought... Maybe it was the Lou Reed quote that sold me on this place?  It certainly wasn't the Bloody.   Oh well... Fox Restaurant Concepts is good (but rarely great) at what they do."

(Its just far too segregated of a city and there are pockets of greatness, but vast expanses of useless nothing in between them which seems to make this a ""must get in your car and drive"" city.) That said, this was the first pub i visited when i moved into Downtown Phx, and i really loved it.  Great vibe... very cool space.  I love that the conversion of this old home into a pub makes the old rooms separate and gives each room its own identity.  Also, and quite importantly, they have a great beer selection.  It could be better, and in NY or Colorado i would probably bitch about this beer selection.  But given that AZ is pretty weak when it comes to craft brews, i was impressed with R&C.  I loved that they had Dogfish Head Punkin Ale in a bottle... i wish they had a bit more on tap, but i love that they at least knew what it was.  Also they had a 60 min IPA in a bottle... i hoped for a 90 min (knowing full well that a 120 min was totally out of the question.)  But again... 60 min Dogfish IPA in a bottle is awesome to find in a pub thats 3 blocks from my house.

I didnt eat the food, but anyone that is giving R&C a low rating because of the food is simply eating in the wrong place.  This isnt fine dining people... its bar food.  It looked as it should.  Jeezz..

I will certainly be back.  A personal thanks to the owners for creating a great space with good beer, a good vibe and no ""No Firearms"" signs at the door."

The pizza is nothing special.  The sandwiches are okay, but you can find better at a deli.  Beer list is decent.  (Tripel Karmaliete, yes!)

Bruschetta Planks are just like the boards at Postino.  Literally, only one was different (pulled pork and pesto).  You get more at postino and they cut them into halves at Bocca while they are sliced into 4 pieced at postino so more people can try them.


Simply put... it's decent for a spot on Mill Ave, but there is absolutely nothing special about this place.  Blaaaaah."

Just like Nine05 and Fate, this place will be closed down soon.  The only difference is that this place will close even faster.  Surprising really, because Fez and Switch are pretty good.  The food and service at Bliss was absolutely dreadful.

I sat down and asked the server what the Rotating tap of Sierra Nevada was.  He said ""what's Sierra Nevada?, is that a beer?""
Where the hell did they find this server?  Are you serious?  How do you not know what Sierra Nevada is??

He goes to the bar to ask what it is, he comes back and says ""its a brown ale, like octoberfest""  I ask: ""Is it Tumble?""  He says, ""oh yeah, thats what they called it.""  Ok, how the hell do you forget the name of the beer from the bar to my table, its like 20 feet!  This server is the dumbest thing ever...  I hope this kid falls face first into the fryer.

Then we ask him how a few things are:  He says, ""the burger is ok, thats my style.""  Then he proceeds to tell me ""Well, i sold a lot of this, and a lot of that.""  Look sparky, i didnt ask how sales were, i want to know whats good.  If a parade of fools came in and ordered 200 poopwiches, that makes them a good seller, still doesnt make them good!  CaPish?

I ordered the Veggie Sandwich... The eggplant was soggy, the bread was burnt (see my pic)...  the carrot slaw was SO covered in garlic crap, that it was not edible.  I didnt even eat a quarter of the food.  They cleared the plate without even asking how it was.

Seriously... i cannot fathom ever going back to this place.  I wish i could give this less than 1 star.... it deserves  a -5.  Epic Fail."
BxwUDCVbBH0supUQ1wNslw,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,4,"Situated about 2 blocks from my office and directly next to a Starbucks means I'm here for lunch or a bite after work several times a month.  Bistro 24 is yet to disappoint.

The service is always stellar, but it's the Ritz, so it ought to be.  The food is all quite good.  It's not the most romantic or fanciest dining room... There are more fun & eclectic places to take a date but is a great place to take a client or colleague for a bite.  i think of the Bistro as more of a lunch place than a dinner spot, but it certainly goes either way.

If you are looking to try the Bistro but are on a bit of a budget, i would try one of these two little tips:
1.  Check out Friday Night Grill... its about 35 per person and all you can eat.  They have steak freshly cooked on the grill outside and a variety of sushi and salads inside.  The desert table is decadent.  For less than you'd spend on a steak next door at Morton's, you'll get a ton of high quality delicious food.
2.  Happy Hour is at 5pm.  Their appetizers and many drinks (including draft beer) are half off.  Get a Firestone Pale Ale or Double Brown Ale for just $3.  One of my favorite appetizers is the Ratatouille Pizza. (Only $7 during happy hour!). It's delicious and eats like a meal.

Bon appetit"
kblFxfo_xnMUZF0U0aGXQw,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,3,"Ohhhh Suburbia.  Only you would have a sushi place with the chairs up on the tables at 9:40 on a Saturday Night.

I stopped by to check this place out after some christmas shopping errands, around 9:30 this Saturday.  Being a fan of sushi and craft beer, this was on my list to check out.

The waitress came by and handed me a list of beers on a folded piece of paper from her pocket.  I was really stoked with the selection.  I ordered a Dogfish Head 90min IPA.  The lovely waitress returned only to crush my hopes by saying that was an old list and that they didnt have any Dogfish Head on tap.  (Insert trombone failure sound effect here.  :::Waaahhh Wahhhhhh:::: ) Then she gave me a newer folded piece of paper with a slightly less appealing selection.  However, i found a tasty IPA and pulled the trigger.

I perused the menu... everything has ""Krab"" which must mean its artificial crab.  Most rolls also have something tempura.  This is classic tell-tale sign that they keep minimal fresh fish on hand.  Given that it is 9:30p on a saturday night and there is only one other table there, it's probably a good thing. This place doesn't get much traffic, so a lot of fish wouldn't sell fast enough.

I asked the waitress if these ""inside out rolls"" were their specialty rolls.  She said, nope, i have another secret list for that.  She slips me the folded paper list.  I'm starting to feel like i'm on a treasure hunt!  So exciting.  What other fun lists might she have up her sleeve?!  I ordered a Senorita roll because it is one of the only ones with fresh tuna on top of the roll.  The roll was large.  It wasn't cut with precision, some pieces were much larger than others, some smaller. (The place was empty, so it wasn't that the sushi chef was busy and rushed, he was just lazy.)  The Krab filling was Meh.  The tuna on top was tasty, but was certainly frozen, so it wasn't super.  Overall, the mediocrity of the roll was hidden by a lot of sweet eel sauce and some tempura crunchies.

As far as sushi places go, i'd give it a C.
However, thanks to their good beer list and given that most suburban peeps wouldnt notice the difference between fresh never-frozen and frozen fish... As far as suburban restaurants go, id give it a B.

If you really like sushi, go somewhere else.  If you just want a good beer in the neighborhood and a passable roll to fill you up, then this place is perfect.  (I'll probably be back for that exact reason.)

If you've recently been on a date to Olive Garden or Red Lobster.  You will think this place is amazing.  Then again, you'll probably order a bud light too."
IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,4,"Another LGO restaurant... and a pretty cool one.

Great ambiance. Excellent patio out back.  Super cool giant lamps inside.  I like the design quite a bit.

The comfort food is nice, though may be a bit overpriced.  A few of the menu items are exactly the same as you'd get at LGO for quite a bit more.  For that reason, If you are heading to Chelsea's... go with the ""Very Special"" section of the menu... no need to have the burgers here.

The short ribs were phenomenal... the mashed potatoes were stellar.
Also tried the Wood Fired Rotisserie Chicken.

Though i went with a friend, i think this would be a pretty good date spot.  If that's whatcher into.  ;)"
8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,4,"I heard that there are only two good Breakfast places in phoenix: Over Easy and Matts Big Breakfast.  I am a big fan of quality breakfast and am pretty picky about them.  This Over Easy location stops seating at about 11:30am.  Frankly, I think thats ridiculously early so i Inquired as to why.  I was told that they would stay open later, but as a part of their lease they have to close early because they share a parking lot with the neighbors.  Their Scottsdale location stays open later and the menu is exactly the same.

We got there around 10:45 on Saturday.  The wait for a table for 2 was about 30 min. They have a pot of coffee out, with a sign that says ""help yourself to coffee while you wait, we will be happy to add it to your check.""  Listen up.  If i am waiting to eat at your place, you can at least give me the coffee for free while i wait.  If im drinking coffee BEFORE i sit down.  There is a damn good chance that i will order a cup when i get to the table, just charge me for it then.  I was peeved by this.  Its coffee for gods sake.

Once we got our table, one of us ordered the Pecan Banana French Toast, the other got an Omelet.  The food was good, arrived quickly and the chef came around to several tables to see how everything was.

Contrary to what others said, the portions were average and were what we expected.  The service wasnt bad either.  The place was pretty crowded and they still managed to keep my coffee cup full and the food came out quickly.

I dont think there is really anything spectacular about this joint, the food was good, the menu was standard.  But its pretty good and we'll probably come back."

::::Looking Around Confused:::  Is this Omaha?  Or is this Phx, the 5th largest city in the US?  You close a restaurant at 11?  This place should just start getting crowded at 9:30!  Ludicrous

I decided to cruise over to Ticoz and sit at the bar.  We asked what the specialty was... the staff told us to try the Enchiladas and the Sangria.  And so we did!

Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas with a Fried Egg on top!   Si Senor!

As i said in my review of Delux... I'm still looking for a great burger place in central phx.  This place let me down.

Not that the food was terrible, but it was just mediocre.  First of all, I had to wait for a table... Usually a good sign!

The waitress was about 16, she knew nothing about wine and was totally incabable of answering questions.  The waitstaff bus their own tables, so it takes longer to turn them.  Then a 17 year old server was arguing with the 16 year old hostess about seating his section.  Terrible.

People... sweet potato fries taste pretty much the same everywhere, lets calm down... mmmkay?  Thanks.  This place blows a hole.  Fox Restaurant Concepts is hit or miss.  Bloom is a miss, True Food is a Hit, ZinBurger is a miss, Sauce is a hit.  etc etc etc.

If you want a good burger and an overpriced bottle of wine that the server knows nothing about... i suggest going to 5Guys Burgers, grab one to go... and get a bottle of wine from the grocery store... just pick one with the coolest label.  Same result."
tIrzcjC5_oBpY6R0G64z5g,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,4,"First thing's first... steak isn't modern, it was like the caveman's first meal.  So, if you aren't cooking it on a spaceship... lay off the trickery!  :)

Fox Rest's are pretty much Hit or Miss, and people either love or hate the decor.  Personally, I don't mind the decor.  It's different, and pretty fun.  The uniforms are fun, dudes in lavender with chuck taylor's.  The girls in short and tight denim colored rompers.

This just isnt as good as Morton's... but it ranks up there with some pretty good steakhouses.  Most of the steak is grain fed, which generally makes for a much fattier, juicier steak.  You don't order a steak for health, so get over it.  I did, however, go with the natural grass fed organic Meyer Natural Angus 12oz NY Strip.  It's grass fed for the first few months, then organic grain fed for the last few weeks to fatten it up before the slaughter.  It was very very good, especially for a NY Strip.

The sides serve 2, we ordered 3 for 4 people and it was more than enough.  Asparagus was pretty thick but not too tart.  The brussles sprouts were seasoned well and very good.  Sweet potato puree with burnt marshmallow is incredible.  (It could totally be a dessert!)

The servers are knowledgeable, the food is good and the drinks are very well poured.  The wine list is fairly extensive but not crazy.

Only complaint I have is that the Valet service isnt dedicated to this restaurant (nor any), it costs $7, not a huge deal if they are there all night.  But they leave at 10:30pm.  Seems to be early on a Saturday night.  For $7, i should be able to enjoy my dinner without looking at my watch to make sure the valet wont lock up my keys.  Pretty friggin lame.

All in all... I dig this place and will certainly come back."

Small building, the bar has only 4 seats.  The patio is the main draw.
How do they get away with opening this place 6 years after Postino's and still try to rip it off?  The bruschetta is way better at postino, and you get more.  The wine and beer list is also better at postinos, and is waaaaay better priced.

Not really worth checking out...  there are many other wine bars that are better."
k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ,pKQNzgvP7308OFHvXqzD8Q,5,"Pronounced with your best NY accent... ""Tha Pah-lah""

I'm a sucker for most things Mid-Century modern... and the Parlor is a damn cool building with great decor.  The beer selection is decent.  Nothing crazy, but some good rotating taps.  Always a good Sierra.  And, i love Red Nectar on tap.  Just a good smooth ale for the summer.  Also a nice rotating wine list, pretty good for a pizza place.

Check the chalk board by the bar... whatever is on special is worth trying.  usually something locally grown and seasonal.  Always a good choice!

My Top Picks here:
Best Pizza: Smokey.
Best Salad:  Heirloom Tomato
Best Sandwich i've ever had in my life: Duck Club

Thats right... i've even been here on several occasions, all by myself, just to pop in after work, sit at the bar and indulge in the Duck Club and a pint after a long day at work.

The duck isnt gamey.  The tomato jam isnt as sweet as i expected.  (Certainly way more savory than the tomato jam that Postino's makes and uses on their bruschetta) the Bacon is thick cut and fantastic.

This is, hands down, my favorite sandwich in Phoenix.  Give it a shot!

Enjoy!"

Typically American Chinese food does not require a lot of skill to do it. Unlike authentic Chinese cuisine which requires a lot of skill and time to cook.
The problem is PF chang does not even know how to cook a simple dish. I have had the worst roast duck in PF Chang, house special pork rib was aweful. I don't understand how they can screw up such simple dish. My wife and I can make better dish than them. Price is way too expensive.

Pad thai is not the real pad thai. It is very americanized, which means it was overloaded with sodium and sugar.
My green curry is too watery. They must put a lot of water inside in order to cut cost.
Our soup tastes flat. Again, too much wafer inside the soup. Cost saving again?

atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,2,"I heard about this great restaurant, serving Rustic French Country cuisine, by a good friend of mine. He raved about how wonderful Metro Brasserie was and knowing him and his tastes, he usually isn't too far off the mark. So when I had the opportunity to pick a place for my girlfriends and I to meet, I thought what a perfect place to check out. Metro Brasserie is located in Old Town Scottsdale near the chic Waterfront.  The Waterfront is surrounded by trendy boutiques, cafes and wine bars and it's a bustle with Phoenician hipsters and tourists alike. We were all really excited to try this hip new place and feeling our stomachs grumble couldn't wait to indulge our taste buds in yummy delights. It was a little bit busy, after all it was a sunny Sunday afternoon, during the busiest time of the day. We were told the wait would be around 40 minutes for the patio and 20 minutes for interior sitting. Without hesitation we decided interior seating would be best...did I mention we were all really hungry? Within 15 minutes the hostess seated us. The restaurant was super cute and reminded me of some of the little french cafes at home, back in Canada. Thoughts of Pomme Frites, Poutine and Croque Monsieur danced through my head.

The menu had a pretty nice variety of entrees on it and you could order either breakfast or lunch. I really like when restaurants give you options. By the way, who doesn't like a good breakfast?? That's a whole other conversation. Anyway, back to Metro Brasserie - the waiter came to take our order, my friend couldn't decide between the French Toast and the Quiche. Who better to ask then the waiter! My friend proceeds to tell the waiter she's torn between two items.""French Toast or Quiche? Which is better?"" Seemed like a pretty normal kind of question for a waiter. His response blew us away. ""Well, they're really different. One is sweet and the other savory."" The table is silent and I'm sure we're all thinking the exact same thing...no shit! It was at that moment our excitement was replaced with disappointment and a hint of irritation. Not only was the waiters personality drier than toast but let's just say he was seriously lacking character and manners. We all put in our orders; a Burger for me, Belgian Endive Salad with chicken for my friend and the Mushroom Brie Quiche for my other girlfriend.

An hour and twenty five minutes went by and no food. Our waiter didn't stop by during that time at all - you think he would have advised us of a problem in the kitchen or even just apologized for the delay. Nothing! Our food finally arrives and we begin to devour what seems like a precious jem. The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare with Gruyere and the Pomme Frites and mayo were amazing. The Quiche on the other hand was just okay, ""nothing special"" and the Belgian Endive Salad with chicken was not the best. Apparently, the Salad was also nothing special and had a strange flavored dressing on it that was clearly not enjoyable. We finish eating and chatting and decide to call it day. Mr. poo poo waiter hadn't been by to check on us and after having had waited so long for a mediocre lunch we weren't terribly happy.

The service was blatantly awful, the waiter was rude, and only one dish was really good...what to do? Being the somewhat decent consumer, we decide to leave a 10% tip. Anything less would be pretty rude considering most of the food industry lives off the tips. I could not bring myself to leave this fine establishment without saying something, I wrote a little note on the receipt that said ""This is the worst service I've ever experienced!"" I really felt compelled to say something about our experience. We're in the middle of a recession and eating out is a privilege that should be enjoyed. So, shouldn't patrons be treated well when spending money in establishments?"

All in all Tarbell's scores 4 stars by me but don't take my word for it just eat it."
RsREl3LkFGiwbt3kGIX4Eg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Mmmm BBQ! What is in that sauce?

I love Honey Bear's. The food is always consistently yummy and the sauce WOW! Some of the locations don't offer the same menu but I'm willing to drive for my favorites.

I really like the fact you can just order a side of the meat and don't necessarily have to eat the bread. Works great for a take home meal and to use on top of salad."
VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"I've eaten here several times now and have never had a bad experience. The food is incredible and with such a large selection of dishes it's the  perfect place to come with a large group. Some of my favorites: Lamb Vindallo, Chicken Masala, Samosas, Tikka Masala, Mango Lassi, Indian Tea (Chai). Oh and who could forget the Garlic Naan - Mmmm!

It's no wonder Guru Palace is always busy ! I'll be back soon and can't wait to try some of the vegetarian dishes."

It's kinda like Cheers to me and my friends...I think do actually know all our names!"

I can't even count on both hands the number of times I've indulged in a pasty and beer. Basically, I'm trying to work my way through the menu! :) And for the love of god don't miss out on the dessert.

I love the food and atmosphere. Service is sometimes sub par but hey it's more of a pub atmosphere so it doesn't seem to bother me half as much.

Eat, drink and be merry with a pasty!"
W2CzAePJakvARgoQuohbOA,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"There's a ton of hype around In-N-Out-Burger...I swear it's like a legend or something to people in California and Arizona. I'm not a huge fan of fast food but even I was persuaded by all the tails of the amazing In-N-Out-Burger. Could it really be that good? It's a burger...

I ordered the cheese burger and side of fries and to my surprise I could taste the potato in the fries. LOL I guess I'm only used the fries tasting like grease so this was actually pretty cool to me. Back to the burger - the meat was cooked just right but I think what makes their burgers so special is the toasted bun! Yeah, I know I'm supposed to say the meat patty but I think the secret really is in the bun. It was perfectly toasted and didn't get soggy from the tomato or juicy burger.

Have I joined the In-N-Out-Burger cult? Uhm, no not just yet but I'd be willing to bet if I had another I might just cave."

The portions are large and perfect for sharing - you will have leftovers unless you're with a big group. I really enjoyed the food and can't wait to try some other items on the menu.

It's a keep on my list!"
Mul_BVwcnhqmp2h_7QFepQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Why haven't I heard of this place before?

I met a couple of friends here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the entire lunch experience at La Bocca. I'm always hesitant to go anywhere on Mill due to parking. Luckily, the location has meter parking close by and a parking garage. The menu is small but has a lot of interesting upscale choices on it. You won't find any plain sandwich flavors here and the pizza choices looked pretty interesting too. I enjoyed a pizza while my friends ordered a sandwich each. So good!

The atmosphere is a perfect place for lunch, happy hour, dates, or a business meeting - pretty much anything. I'm definitely going to suggest this place to others."
eS29S_06lvsDW04wVrIVxg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Went here last night at my friends (the birthday girl) request and were very pleased. The restaurant is super cute and has a nice ambiance about it - beautiful paintings by local artist adorn the wall, live music and fragrant scents fill the air. The perfect atmosphere for a delicious meal!

Barrio Cafe does not take reservations. We had a party of six and waited around 10 minutes - not bad for a busy Saturday night. We started with the highly recommended Quesdalilla de Langosta Borracha (lobster on corn tortillas) - delicious and not too heavy! I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas (chicken with a tomatillo cream sauce) and tried my friends Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork). No complaints from anyone at the table. I could tell we were all savoring our meals as our table was actually quiet!

The waiter was kind enough to bring out a Flan de mi Mami in celebration of my friends birthday. Too bad we had brought a cake with us. I did manage to try a tsp of it though....nothing beats a good flan. :)

The only negative is the noise level. It was Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty full. The lively patrons combined with the live music in the background made it virtually impossible to hear my friends across the table and I have pretty good hearing.

I would definitely come back! I saw they have Sunday brunch and my stomach is already gurgling at the possibilities."
SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"I've been to House of Tricks a few times now and am finally reviewing it. My first two visits here were great but I had only ordered appetizers so I'll give it three stars in fairness of my other visits being great. Sad to say my most recent visit was just okay. I had the Filet Mignon and was so disappointed. While the meat was a good cut and it was cooked to my specifications it was incredibly salty. So salty I couldn't even finish it. We came with a large group of people so I really didn't want to send it back. Even my mashed potatoes were laced with salt. :(

After dinner I asked my friends how their meals were and across the table we agreed they had been a bit overly friendly with the salt shaker in the kitchen.

The atmosphere and service on the other hand are always great. Unfortunately, I need some space and time to think House of Tricks. It's not you, it's me and I guess I just don't love salt as much as you."
nGaEPWylUEAiOn5HmY-VYQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"This hip little cafe is a girls dream! A beautiful decor of bright green and brown gives this restaurant a stylish feel. I've had the pleasure of eating at Lisa G's a few times now and really like it. The mini sandwiches, bowl of balls and steak salad are among my favorites. I've never had dessert here as I'm usually too full to attempt it but I imagine if her desserts are anything like the entrees...they've got to be delicious!

It gets pretty busy here during lunch and dinner so prepare to wait. There is however a cute little bar where you can enjoy a nice glass of wine before dinner. This would also be a great date place. I give Lisa G's four stars. Enjoy!"
KYo0OqRr-q-TM2o66MBJYg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,A hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I loved the design of the restaurant and was so excited to try the food. The menu isn't large at all but there is great substance in their offerings. I had the chili lime chicken which was really delicious. I don't think I managed to eat even half of my order but it made for great leftovers. :)  I noticed they had a very reasonable take out menu too!
LpK_4zdK3kxtpAiLcwEohg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"This place is so hip! I wouldn't say it looks like your typical Thai restaurant but I think it's more a trendy Asian fusion cafe with prices to match. The decor has a minimalistic feel with a little burst of color throughout - I think I'm the only one that appreciates this stuff. In any case it's really cute! The service was really good. We ordered a Singha and the waitress also brought a Phuket beer for us to try. I love it when servers do things like this. It gives me an opportunity to try something I may have never ordered. We had a long conversation with the owner about beers from Thailand and Thailand in general which was really nice. I think it's great when owners engage in conversations with patrons - really offers a more personal feel to a place.

Anyway, onto the food. I have a severe allergy to peanuts and I mentioned this to our server at the time of ordering. They were very professional about it and said not to worry they would ensure no cross contamination. :) I ordered the Grilled Halibut and my friend had the Pad Thai without peanuts. Normally, I'd get an appetizer as well and I did really want to try the salt and pepper squid but we were going to see a movie after and I can't watch a movie without popcorn in my hand. My Halibut was light and flaky and was accompanied with a sweet & sour pineapple chili sauce with asparagus spears. It was sooo good! My friend said her Pad Thai was better then the Mint Thai Cafe!

I'm surprised to read some of the other reviews as I really enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Although, I didn't need to use the washroom while I was there. I'm curious to try some of their other dishes so I'll definitely come back again but maybe in a group or a date."
Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"Can here with friends for lunch and had the buffet. For the price and selection it was pretty good. There was a really vast selection of dishes and desert. Not sure what dinner is like here but I'd certainly be open to giving it a try.

The service was also pretty good for it having it been lunch hour."
OtGSQQzV7uF8XPAsNIh7Bw,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,5,"I've only been to Elements for drink and have always wanted to experience the menu. So last Friday, I did just that and what an experience it was.

The service was great but not annoying like what I experienced at Lon's. I loved the Buddha bread and eggplant dip. It was a nice way to start our dinner. My friend and I tried the cheddar cheese grits & scampi - WOW! Let me just say I've never had grits before. These grits melted in my mouth like sugar. Now ,I understand what people mean when they say good grits are not just grits they are heaven.

I had the filet migon on puff pasty with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms - delicious. I was really impressed with the cut and preparation of my filet - it was flawless! And of course we couldn't eat at Elements without paying homage to the pastry chief too. We ordered a dessert which was a trio of chocolate. There was a milk chocolate pate like dessert that tasted like a creamy fudgicle on steroids, homemade marshmallow and a melt in your mouth dark chocolate torte.

Great food, great service and a breathe taking view...you just can't go wrong."
7tdVsSDXRKtLLC-fD1hJ-A,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"I've probably driven by this place a hundred times over the four years I've lived in Gilbert and not noticed it. Last night, after reading my fellow yelper's reviews on Nando's Mexican Cafe - I decided to give it a whirl. At first I wasn't sure exactly where it was but after driving behind some of the businesses on Baseline I found it tucked in the back. The parking lot was completely full which led me to believe this place isn't a secret after all.

As I walked up I noticed a beautiful patio with lots of ornate iron work. The restaurant was hopping with only a 10 minute wait. Since this was an experimental choice for my group we had our server recommend the most popular items on the menu. He quickly responded with the Pollo Rico and also suggested we try the mini combination plate as an appetizer. The combination had an assortment of all the items including the infamous Pollo Rico but in a miniature size. With the advice of our server we ordered the mini combo platter, chicken fajitas, El Jefe Chimichanga, and Enchiladas Del Mar. Our main courses arrived but the appetizer didn't show up. We were kind of disappointed until our server came along realizing we hadn't received the appetizer. He said he'd comp us for it even after we said we've got more than enough food. My fajitas plate literally took up half the table!!! I swear there was a pound of chicken which I barely put a dent in. I was great to be able to try a few of the other restaurant favorites from the appetizer plate. My only somewhat negative comment would be I thought the Jalapeno Cream Cheese on the Pollo Rico was really salty. Now it might be that my taste buds are ultra sensitive right now due to a low sodium diet. In any case my brother in law also thought the cream cheese was pretty salty. Other than that, we were all completely satisfied with our meals and couldn't get over the portion size. We ended up each taking home leftovers that I'm sure will take me a few days to eat and my big brother even managed to feel full / satisfied!!!

This place was so yummy! If you're in the area, give it a try."
02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"My coworker and I had a craving for Indian. I had no idea this place was so close. Got in, sat down and within minutes the waiter was at our table. I didn't even have a chance to scan the menu...lunch buffet it was.

The buffet was decent but not very extensive. As another Yelper wrote, I'm not really into drumsticks but in a pinch I can eat it. The Tandoori chicken was really good and the Chickpea Masala Chaat was out of this world. Honestly, I could have just had the Chickpea salad with naan.

This restaurant is great for a quick lunch - they'll get you in and out in no time! I'm not sure what dinner is like here but am definitely open to checking it out.."
8rlTOw0IA1TENURMBJpaXw,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,5,"What's in a name? This restaurant name says it all - Morning Glory Cafe! If you can handle the wait you will definitely love it. The food is scrumptious and the view makes you feel like you're somewhere other than south Phoenix.

My only advice would be to try it early in the morning in February or March when the Phoenix heat hasn't begun. I don't think it'd be too pleasant in our 100F+ days!"
HAcRdfqNaIu1Gujz08gCaQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"When you can't get to Katz Deli in NYC Jason Deli is a decent alternative.

Like most deli's the portion sizes are rather large so consider sharing. I had a half pastrami sandwich on rye with a side salad and couldn't finish it all. The pastrami was melt in your mouth good but the rye bread was a little too gummy for my taste. Jason's Deli has a great salad bar as well - perfect for lunch!

Service was okay, although I waited a bit to put in my order because the cashier was on the phone."

hAioxEk3WU-SzlqIM4TI7w,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,I feel compelled to write a review for Maria Maria since I've eaten here a few times now and remained silent. The only problem is I don't have a lot to say. It's alright but it's not terribly exciting. I've mostly come for lunch and the service is fast and friendly. The food has been good but again nothing exciting. Perhaps I'm just ordering the wrong thing.
yTur95e-pqQCYGGyVp6rAw,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"I checked this place out last night after work - specifically the supermarket. I'm a regular Lee Lee's shopper so I wanted to see what all the buzz was about. The parking lot was pretty full as I pulled up but when I entered the market and it was really quiet...perfect time for me to explore. I'm guessing they were all enjoying a delicious bowl of Pho in one of the nearby restaurants. I have to agree with some of the other people who mentioned it was definitely more focused on Chinese & Vietnamese cuisine. There is a small about of items from the remaining areas in Asia but not as large of a selection as Lee Lee's. So, if you're wanting a Korean condiment maybe head down to Lee Lee's or the Korean market on Dobson.

I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive selection of meats and fish. Honestly, I have never seen so many types of either in any supermarket in Phoenix! If you love to cook and need a rare type of cow part...Mekong's probably got it. It was also really nice to see some prepackaged meats like Korean short ribs. In the past, you would have to wait in line or ask someone for help.

My one and only beef with Mekong supermarket was the lack of price tags throughout. There are stacks of open boxes in the middle aisle but it took me forever to find prices on some of the items. I think they may have originally had them on a box , the items were sold and the box was removed. It was a little bit of the ""price is right"" game happening last night. Lastly, they had a few prepackaged bakery items without any sort of label on them as well. While they looked delicious I had no idea what it even was and what sort of filling it had. It only had the name of the bakery on it. I guess people like me with a peanut allergy will shy away from guessing what's in the pastry.

If you have time, I highly recommend checking it out. I was very happy with my finds and I'll be making my own Boba tea tonight! :)"

I'm a big fan of Nutella and Cibo knows how to do it right...enter Banana Nutella Crepe. I honestly thought I had died and gone to heaven! Okay, I'm slightly obsessed with Nutella but can you blame me? Cibo makes a mean pizza pie too. Give it go and you're sure to leave with a smile!"
iJBnqweAPDTCfyMcRrG90w,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,2,"I wonder if their burgers and dogs are better?

My friends suggested Giant Hamburgers, for their post PT run treat, after reading all the Yelp reviews. We got their around 8:30am and there were quite a few people. The restaurant itself is unassuming and looks more diner like.

I ordered the single breakfast and had them substitute the egg for just an egg white at no extra charge! You pay up at the counter which is kinda cool to me, no waiting for a check afterward. Got myself a cup of Joe which by the way was very good. :) Our breakfasts arrived and chowed down on the hash browns, egg, toast & bacon.

Honestly, I just wasn't impressed. It was okay but lacking that true dinner flavor. I guess I just assumed it'd be like Matt's Big Breakfast or something. I think I'll stick to Liberty Market or Matt's for a tasty breakfast."

nK4PaQEpSXW6-2F_hID6pg,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Mmmm mmm

At the recommendation of Julie M. we made reservations and it was a good thing we did as it was pretty busy. The restaurant is super cute and has a real Tuscan feel to it. We were seated promptly when our waitress came over to introduce herself...Fredriko! I must say I was a little leary as one of the previous reviews had commented on the bad service she received from this waitress. Lucky for us Fredriko was very friendly and efficient.

The menu is rather extensive so plan being a bit more descive that day or you'll stare at for a long time. We started with a house salad and enjoyed the complementary bread. The bread was crusty and bit chewy, just like I like it. I found the olive oil to be a little awkward to pour but I soon got over it when I tasted the combination. I had a craving for fish and wanted to know just how fresh it was. Fredriko told me the fish is frozen fresh and brought in daily. I had the Bavette con Vongole - Bavette pasta with clams in a light clam sauce. The sauce was very light in consistency and had a nice smooth flavor to it with just the right amount of garlic. Jill T. ordered the Tortelloni Aurora - Prosciutto & veal filled tortelloni with diced prosciutto cotto & peas in a pink sauce. Jill T. let me try her dish and I think it was even better than my Bavette con Vongole. We ended the meal with a nice dessert that I haven't seen at any of the Italian restaurants I frequent - Fruta di bosco con Zabaione. The dessert was good but a little to potent for our liking.

I'm looking forward to trying their happy hour!"

There menu is really extensive - you want it they make it. My favorite is the gyro's and the gyro salad. So good! I've also tried several sandwiches here which were also good but I figure if I'm eating at a Greek place I should have Greek! The humus, spanakopita & falafel are great choices.

Oh and the staff is so friendly! Give it a go you won't be disappointed."
Clq09vq8uOjAbGY3BaQWDQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"I wanted to mix things up a bit with our restaurant choices so I suggested Takamatsu. I hadn't heard anything about before but drive by it often and thought it can't be too bad.

We arrived and were seated within 15 minutes - not to bad for a Saturday night. We sat at our table for almost 20 minutes without menus or water. The server did come by and mention they had no more menus left....how does that happen?

Anyway, once we finally got our menu's we selected a few different kinds of beef, shrimp, & squid. The food came and we began to BBQ our hearts out. The waitress seemed a little concerned with our skills...I chalk it up to the fact that we let the Brits grill and well what exactly does a Brit know about grilling? It was a fun way to have dinner and I think everyone enjoyed the tableside grilling.

Once the meat was cooked we began chowing down...it was pretty good but I think we ordered way too much. I guess our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. It was no were near like the K'BBQ in San Jose but hey this is the desert and we are lucky to have even have this.

We tend to hang around and have a drink or two after dinner .The wait staff seemed really uncomfortable with this.I looked to see if there were folks waiting for a table - nope!  I swear, every 10 minutes one of the wait staff would come by to check if we had paid. At one point, we hid the check so they would stop coming over and guess what...they brought us a new check?!?!?! WTF Maybe we looked a little shady? Who knows but we found it rather irritating.

I guess I'll need to give it another go to see if the service is better the next time around but overall it wasn't too shabby."
A6nY4SCrMuLPtlbq-EKnfA,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,"Cute cute cute! We hit up this place last Friday for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. It's got a chic vibe about it with it's dark wood interior, great music, drink specials and a yummy menu. We got there around 5pm and The Living Room was all a buzz with 30 somethings and the occasional 40 something. We both took advantage of the happy hour drink specials and ordered from the menu. After starring at the menu for what seemed like an eternity, I decided on the bruschetta . I had to choose 4 types from a long list but there were so many options it made it tough for me to decide. I really enjoyed the fig, prosciutto & goat cheese...my absolute favorite.

Our waiter was very attentive and not once did we have to go looking for him...huge plus! Overall a great experience for the two of us. It's conveniently located in the east valley with easy access from the lower 202. It's great to see some trendy places popping up in the east valley. :)

We'll certainly return and may even try relocating our regular happy hour crowd to The Living Room. Happy eats! Cheers"

The atmosphere has a retro chic feel and has cocktail hour written all over it. :) I'm a sucker for 50's inspired design...Jacobsen's Swan Chair...Oh la la!

We decided to ring in Friday with lunch outside the office at Cafe ZuZu. I thought the menu offered a large selection of items from chili and salad to sandwiches and burgers. Prior to ordering, the waitress brought over a basket of rolls (or buns as we say in Canadian). They were a slightly sweet eggy bread that melted in my mouth. I decided to try the Seared Ahi Salad with an Asian dressing. The Ahi was prepared perfectly, slightly seared on the outside and juicy on the inside. It was presented on a bed of spinach, with yellow peppers and sliced onions - delicious! My coworkers all tried something different: Salmon Salad, Border Chili (which looked incredible), and the half sandwich with soup. From their response it sounded like the Border Chili was the ticket!

I was pretty impressed with my overall experience and will be back for cocktail hour! I give Cafe ZuZu four stars."
_9vGmNrEcLWFOnUzeUdfag,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,3,"This is definitely more of a family place than fine dining. The food is pretty decent especially if you are a serious meat eater - big portions and big value. They make their own root beer which is very yummy!

What I don't like about Joe's Real BBQ is the feeling of being in a cattle call. You stand in a line to order your food and the line is always very long. It kinda reminds me of Southwest Airlines which I'm also not a big fan of! It is however a great place to take your kids. It's loud and any sounds of screaming children blend in well together. ;)"

It was absolutely crazy busy for a Wednesday night which made for a very long stomach gurgling wait but alas garlic knots to the rescue! :) The garlic knots were out of this world ooey gooey buttery deliciousness.

The servers were all very friendly and make a point to ask your name and if you've tried Casanova Brothers Pizza before...nice personal touch.

One suggestion though - I think with the amount of business they do they should have menu service at the tables. The order area was so jammed packed full of people waiting it spilled into the table area.

Anchovy pizza for me next time!!"

Low mein, chow mein, hot pots, fried rice dishes, squid sauteed with green onions & peppers and so much more. Really what more could a girl want!

The service was great and once again they were very accommodating with my peanut allergy. After chowing down on all the fine food the server brought the bill. To our surprise there was a 10% discount. At first we thought they made a mistake and missed one of the dishes. My brother in law asked what the 10% discount was for. Apparently, on weekend at 6pm they have a happy hour saving patrons 10%! Seriously, what's not to love about this place."
zUgDrRtGvK5ZTFlHCsTHwA,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,4,This is one of the best Italian restaurants in the east valley. My friends and I had forgotten about it and decided to dine there this evening. I had the gnocchi and it was delicious. The sauce is soooo fresh and has just the right amount of basil in it. My friends really enjoyed their meals as well. We will of course be returning!! :)
Z2L0j0MZ9m0IwaWmcvnxGQ,yoT5mQ0EeB40AAMi4ZIyTw,2,"The peeps and I stopped here for happy hour yesterday. I had been warned by my guy friends that it sucked both times they tried it out. With that in mind, I knew not to have any expectations. We walked in and it was a room full of guys. Now ladies we're talking a range of guys from ASU age to 30's. Not too bad for the single ladies but we were hoping for a mix of people. As time went on the bar got busier but only men poured in. My guy friend was not terribly impressed with the sausage-fest at hand.

The beer was pretty decent. I tried Belgium's original white beer - pretty tasty with a nice floral flavor.  I also had their version of potato skins that were *gasp*...deep fried!!  So not in my daily calorie plan. I must admit I enjoyed them but I had to ask for knife as I couldn't cut through these nuggets of goodness.

I'm not sure we'll be back as it's nice to have a mix of people in a bar but we gave it a good try. Perhaps, it's just one of those places that doesn't attract a variety of people."

We had the lobster bisque, filet, short ribs, a side of mashed potatoes, and the creme brulee dessert. Everything was great! The creme brulee had a bit too much of an alcohol taste to it.

Oh, and the bread given at the beginning was delicious!!!"

We ordered the brie appetizer, which was very good.

The salmon entree was a little fishy and overcooked. The spinach ravioli was just okay - the sauce was decent.

The sundae for dessert was good as well.

All in all, we had a decent meal, but we would have been happier if we didn't have to pay as much for the food. It isn't quite worth the price."

My milkshake was a bit milky and lost the flavor of the gelato. But I would still return and maybe just choose a stronger flavor or ask for less milk. Otherwise, it was great!!"

The food was good, but the portions were tiny. I think most people at the table (except for the person who ordered the flatbread) finished their meal and were still hungry. Luckily we ordered lots of desserts to fill our bellies!

We probably wouldn't return unless the idea was initiated by someone else."

The food was just decent. Nothing to write home about. I would return here, but only with my family who likes it so much. I wouldn't go on my own."

They give you wontons and a salad right after you order, and the food we had as leftovers heated up very nicely! It tasted almost as good as the food did when it first came out.

Great lunch prices!"
tCJGEQVqjELLYv3fPNX5Rw,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"Excellent food and service. We never order wine or alcohol at high-end restaurants, as we are not drinkers. Fleming's is one of the only places that does not treat us poorly after discovering that our bill will only include food (hey, we're great tippers!).

The food is incredible, and the staff is very respectful, polite, and friendly. We just love coming back to Fleming's over and over again!"

We had the make your own pizza w/mushrooms and grilled veggies. Pretty good! Very good for the price too...just $8 total. There were also options to add basil, garlic, rosemary, etc, for free! Also, we shared a salad that was really good...the chicken was great!

It's a bit hard to see from Camelback, but it's worth it once you find it! The place was PACKED for lunch on a Wednesday. I guess that says it all!"

VgfqjXetLMxn5X5_uomBkg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,3,"So-so food. Nothing exceptional. We had the trout and salmon, and both were just okay. The bread rolls were good, and the salad had a pretty good dressing. The soup was just decent. Nice ambiance and location, and the staff was friendly. They should spring for some nicer plates and bowls though!"
ukCTLs6T8LY1eUBXiAlmCg,vLixm38Zd-xgAvN1LQJfKQ,5,"We eat mostly vegetarian, but this place makes us want meat! We really enjoyed everything we ate here - filet mignon, bone-in filet, asparagus, mashed potatoes, salad, and our butter cake dessert. Service was really great as well!"
E8ugJa02FVCgfnjqV817iw,Og3hhupcQKP0rWO9roOFig,4,"After driving around north Phoenix all afternoon my friend and I stopped in to grab a bite to eat. He had been here before and ordered the chicken rice noodle soup and I had the usual pork chop, shredded pork and egg. If I am trying a Vietnamese place for the first time I will order this dish as a reference point. I was a little surprised to get a egg over easy with my dish instead of a egg loaf. But, I should have asked and it was not the first restaurant here to do this. Over all the meal was good. It was not the watered down version you sometimes find around town to fit American tastes. The restaurant itself is a little old, but it just goes to prove you can't judge a restaurant by it's looks."
ropJyZdmv6NeDU2Vz1I_Hg,Og3hhupcQKP0rWO9roOFig,3,"I have eaten dim sum here a few times and the quality and selection depends on when you go. I have found that they have a better selection on the weekends. The only drawback is that you might have to fight the crowds. If you are OK with a slightly smaller selection then the middle of the week is for you. I ate there today and it was not that busy. It made for an enjoyable and relaxed lunch. The service was good and because it was not that busy she had time to chat with me. This restaurant is clean and had reasonable prices. I would have given another star but they didn't
have a couple of items that I wanted."
_reykENmCBh03iczpFAufg,Og3hhupcQKP0rWO9roOFig,4,"After a long absence from the local dining scene I finally got to out and enjoy one of my favorate foods. Sushi. A friend had just graduated and a couple of us took her to dinner. Since we were close, I suggested Sakana. I had wanted to try it but was wary of franchised restaurants. The Mesa location was a little small, but the staff made up for it. I thought they were very friendly and the wait for the sushi was average. I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of the fish and rolls. I am quite picky when it comes to sushi. The prices in this restaurant were middle of the road, but the staff and the fish made it a good value. Just like another shot of sake, another visit will be a  foregone conclusion."

While the coffee isn't quite Starbucks quality, it's definitely a cut above average and most importantly it ain't at Starbucks prices either...and with endless refills to boot.  Also you can get solidly good breakfast food (especially if, like me, you're a fan of biscuits & gravy) as well as decent selection of sandwiches & salad for lunch.

3-star food plus 1 extra star for above average bottomless coffee & newspaper as well as healthy options for those days when you may feel like cutting down on grease."
GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"Disappointed the first time, but with our faith in Mr K's taste, we tried it again and was pleasantly surprised.

First time we went for lunch and had mainly chaats (Indian snacks) $4.99-$5.99, which are only served Sat & Sun 12pm-5pm.  Our obsession with chaats started at the famous Vik's Chaat Corner in Berkeley, when we used to live in the area.  Unfortunately, the chaats here were lacking in flavor, which is a big problem given Indian food, especially chaats, is all about the spices.  For the Phoenix area, we prefer Little India Chaat in Tempe - it lacks decor and service but is made up by cheap prices and tasty food.

Given our obsession with good naan and our faith in Mr K's taste, we decided to give it another shot.  We went for dinner on a Sunday and ordered:

Saag Ghosht (lamb cubes with spinach in a light cream sauce) $12
- highly recommended by Howard Seftel as ""helpfully"" quoted on the side of the menu
- we, on the other hand, found the lamb cubes themselves to be dry and bland despite being in a tasty sauce

Fish Goa Curry (fish filets in coconut curry sauce) $14
- Sunday's daily special so came with rice, one naan and salad
- this fish was the BOMB: perfectly balanced subtle spices that complimented the tender flaky fish instead of overwhelming it
- the naan is as good as Mr K claims

Great modern decor and good service.  We are definitely going back on a Sunday night for the Fish Goa.  Thanks for another good recommendation Mr K!"
qpq8KuMyPSwraUFfRVOMQg,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,2,"After an awesome experience with Lo-lo's, I thought I'd expand my horizon by trying out other soul food places in the area.

Bobby C's seem like a cool bar....but unfortunately, it wasn't so cool a place for dinner.

We ordered fried catfish, fried chicken and country fried steak.  They came with sides of dirty rice, corn bread, green beans, collard greens and mac & cheese.  All the fried stuff were decently crispy, but somewhat unseasoned and not particularly memorable.

The sides stood out more...but not in a good way.Rarely do I wish that a restaurant would use Kraft's blue box for the Mac & Cheese, but in this case it would have been an improvement.  The ""fresh"" green beans has the distinct taste of a tin can.  Corn muffin was dry.

It'll be hard to get me to stray from Lo-lo again"

After Lucky's on the West side sold to a new owner who decided to Americanize the menu, HK Asian Diner's chef probably cooks the best Cantonese food in the Valley IMHO.
Hurry in before this family decides to sell or retire like New Hong Kong on Indian School in Phoenix is imminently doing. Ask for the authentic menu - don't worry it's in English.
If you prefer Northern Chinese food, then you can rejoice in the proliferation of restaurants that have opened recently, like Dinghao, Nanzhou and BJ's in Chandler and Mesa.
I expect this trend to continue where Northern Chinese restaurants continue to proliferate while Cantonese restaurants disappear, as a result of the changing Chinese population, especially students that are coming to Arizona."

We started the meal off with a generous portion of guacamole...fresh & chunky with added touch of cranberry

Pollo En Mole was good but the mole sauce played only 2 notes sweet and hot, lacking the depth of complexity that I was expecting

The Cochinita Pibil was a major disappointment.  While the texture was soft and succulent (as per 12 hour slow roasting technique quoted in the menu), it needed flavor...we had to resort to giving a good dollop of hot sauce to finish the dish.

The Churros we ended with was delicious with goat milk caramel for an added twist.  However, thought that  the $9.50 price was a bit high for just 2 pieces.

Conclusion:  Good food, but just didn't deliver for the price"

The Shepherd's Pie ($12.99) that is so proudly highlighted in the menu missed the mark.  Having lived in London, we're a big fan of the dish and were excited to see that TF uses the more traditional minced lamb and not beef.  However, the meat was overpowered by way too much dried rosemary leaves.  The brown bread that accompanied it was the highlight, followed by the mashed potatoes and finally the lamb.

This is a good place to hang out over a couple of pints while the food comes second."
p-8AMN9Q0qwym-3Pdle20Q,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,3,"A major drawback is the stale smell of the dining room.  My meal would probably have been a lot more enjoyable if I got to eat in the outdoor patio.

It's a good place, however, to take a mixed group - there's something for everyone - gyros and shwarmas for carnivores, Med platter (hummus, baba, tsaziki, tabouleh, falafel) for vegetarians.  Portions are generous - especially the lentil and rice side which was as big if not bigger than the mains.  Food hits the table fast and the prices are reasonable - no wonder this place is always packed."

Luckily the outdoor seating was beautiful but a bread basket definitely would've helped calm our rumbling stomachs.

Farm burger ($14) was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley - flavorful beef patty with a moist tender interior.  Braised short rib sandwich was a bit bland by comparison.  Locally grown garden veg crudite ($14) was fresh and full of crunchy healthy goodness."
8rlTOw0IA1TENURMBJpaXw,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,3,"You come here for the Farm environment and not so much for the food.  After a long wait on a warm weekend morning, the uncomfortable plastic chairs offered little reconciliation.

Would've preferred if the French Toast Bread Pudding did not come drenched in maple syrup - much nicer to sweeten as needed.  The country fried steak was unfortunately not as good as Denny's and our favorite version in the Valley at Texaz - this one got soggy quickly under the gravy. My veg and egg skillet with white truffle oil was tasty but seemed a bit small and would've benefited from a side of toast.

Other Valley breakfast eateries like Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast offer more satisfying food.  Come here to get away from the city and stretch your legs on the farm.  For only a few bucks more, eat at Quiessence and get more comfy seating, real table cloths and glass cups instead of help-yourself paper ones, which really isn't as earth-friendly."

Happy hour is Sun-Thu 5pm-6pm, when all sushi (non-market priced nigiris not makis) on the menu are 50% off.  Most items are $4-$5.  The highest price item is amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) $7, which was huge and very fresh.  The head is served deepfried which is better than any french fry.  I also like the oysters with ponzu sauce."

There's a sign on Shea but otherwise the store's not visible from the street.  We drove under the arches of Agua Caliente Shopping Center and eventually found NYBnB on the right.  We were surprised by how big the place was.

We ordered an Everything bagel toasted with cream cheese ($2.39) and agree with Kristin that it would've been better more toasted.  I also prefer mine chewier.  They were more than generous with the cream cheese.  I wish you could pay only for the amount of cream cheese you want.

On our way out, we bought a half-dozen bag of mini bagels and learned that bialys are, unlike bagels, not boiled so the texture's lighter and lower in calories.

To me, a good crusty, chewy bagel's worth the calories!"

If you're not sure that Chinese diner food is like...think great stir fried noodle dishes (like the beef chow hoa in the picture above) and old school Chinese interpretation of Western dishes like baked pork chop smothered with tomato sauce on rice (check out the other picture above).

Michael (the chef) and his wife (up front) are friendly folks, so go ahead and chat them up for recommendation about what's good here.  Their best dishes are usually posted on the walls rather than in either of the 2 printed menu...go figure."

It's been a while since we've been back but since it's Chinese New Year, it's worth the trip.

I was excited to see an expanded menu, especially the Pineapple Bun with Char Siu, which I had asked them repeatedly to add, since it was all the rage in HK and Vancouver.  As far as I know, no other restaurant in the Valley offers it.  There is actually no pineapple - just looks a bit like the outside of one on the top, which is sweet and crunchy, providing great contrast to the savory roasted pork filling.

Everything's as good as I remember with the same ridiculously low prices. Only the Chiu Chow dumpling was disappointing - soggy wrapper with dried out meat filling.  Can't believe this place is not packed to the rafters.  I say ditch the old-fashioned push carts and choose dimsum steamed to order!  Plus they now have picture menus!"
SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,3,"This is Ling & Louie's flagship store which they are using to work out their concept so that they can franchise many more.  Unsurprisingly, they still have quite a few kinks to work out.  The cuisine is Pan Asian which is not easy to execute given how much variation there is.

Taipei Pepper Beef had a nice kick and the filet mignon cubes were beautifully charred.  The sauce was very tasty but don't know why they have to put it all over rice so that you have no control of how much rice to eat with it.  In fact, this dish needs way more rice given how strongly flavored the sauce is.

The Lemongrass Mahi Mahi was a big letdown after starting on such a high note.  The firm flesh of the fish just does not lend itself well to deepfrying and the lemongrass is such a delicate herb that all flavor is lost in the frying process.  The fried spinach leaves were not crispy and the sauces that accompanied the dish were sweet and boring - contrary to their tagline ""Not for boring people"".

Our waiter let the general manager know about our reaction and he immediately came over to speak to us.  He offered to take the Mahi Mahi off our bill and comped us another Taipei Pepper Beef to take with us.  Service is great and I'm hoping the food will catch up to it.  I'd definitely go back for the Beef dish and will hopefully have  a better experience with other dishes.  So until then..."

Indeed, Ground Control's slick decor behind its bland strip mall exterior makes this a place where you really wanna linger over your latte.  And the house made gelato is on the high side of enticing.  But the lure that drags me into my car and take that hour long drive down to Goodyear is gonna be the awesome orange monster in the back of the room where the coffee beans are roasted several times a week...from medium to dark, no wimpy light roast here.  Yes, you can absolutely taste the freshness.  My personal favorite is Guatemala Huehuetenango.  With beans this good, I take it black...so smooth you don't need cream to take the non-existent hard-edge off, nor is any sugar needed to counter the non-existent sour off-notes (unlike a big chain competitor).

And if you end up hanging out so long that you actually need more solid nourishment, then the Mediterranean Salad with the tasty bits of candied pecans and mozzarella is spot on, while the pesto salami panini is not half bad."
IsN0qEzgAXBjbT3qn6lokA,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"I love the use of lemon zest to lighten up a pizza especially as the weather gets warmer.  There was a light sprinkle of it on my clam pie even though it was not mentioned in the menu and it was also on the shrimp pie as well as the olive oil gelato in a candied version.

The clam pie was a little disappointing - I was hoping for something like the ones I've tasted in NYC.  Clams are such subtle things that more needs to be used and I would not mind paying a few more dollars for that.

Our disappointment was quickly redeemed by the wonderfully refreshing and  balanced flavor of the shrimp pie.  The combination of perfectly cooked crunchy shrimp, basil, chili flakes and lemon zest set off fireworks on every part of my palate.  It's something I would definitely go back for.

The pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at Mozza in LA but it does not have the complexity in flavor of Chris Bianco's.  Bianco's probably uses a starter dough that has developed that amazing flavor due to over a decade of use.  That's tough to beat.

The olive oil gelato has a nice creaminess to it but tasted more like sweet cream base with a hint of lemon than olive oil.  My only problem with it was my expectation to taste olive oil but now that I know it's more about the texture, I think I like it more."

We came on a recommendation by a trusted friend who told us we had to order the Green Chile Pork Stew ($7).  It came in a small iron kettle that kept the pork nice and hot.  We were not disappointed - the pork was tender and succulent infused with layers of spicy flavors.

We also ordered the Fondue Pot ($9) which came with three 1-oz lamb chops, butternut squash and green apples for dunking.  The cheese in the fondue tasted like a mild blend of cheddar and other American cheeses.  The lamb chops were delicious on their own but just a touch over cooked at medium-well.  The contrast of textures between the roasted squash and green apple cubes were great with the cheese.

At the start of the meal, we also ordered the Field Green salad which came with candied pecans, sliced apples, diced beets and warm crusted round of goat cheese.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the plate split for us even though it was only a $5 dish.

The service was great - our water glasses were never less than half empty and our plates were quickly changed.  Happy hour wines are only $5 a glass.  I ordered a red Zinfandel and it was good to see the proper glass brought to me along with a small carafe of wine, allowing for the right pour to facilitate lots of swirling.  It's these small details that sets a restaurant apart.

I don't remember the last time I had this quality of a meal and service for less than $30.  We will most definitely be back and often."
6Iu4YDjAPrDRRrPCt_E2zA,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"No false advertising here.  Just the best damn chicken fried steak I've had in Phoenix (and BBQ beef ribs, see update).

We also got the bbq pork sandwich which was so mouth wateringly good that I wished Texaz would just go ahead and deliver a full line of bbq items...and stop teasing me with just this one tempting tasty bit

Really generous portions. The sides was just typical..but with the mains this good, I couldn't really care.   My plate was overflowing and my jeans needed loosening after the super yummy and yet easy on the wallet lunch.

Update:

We've been on the hunt for BBQ beef ribs which doesn't seem as popular as pork ribs.  It may not be as tender as pork but the flavor is what we're after.  When we heard that our favorite Texan restaurant serves it only on Tuesday nights, we had to make the trip.

We arrived after 9pm but luckily they still had one order left.   $11 for five giant beef back ribs - slow-smoked over hickory and oak, topped with a homemade BBQ sauce and served with their rustic mashed potatoes.

The dry spice-rub had so infused into the meat during the long slow cooking process that we didn't need the sauce.  Eating beef ribs is a carnivorous act - almost caveman like - if it wasn't for the fact that the server thoughtfully brought us a warm wet napkin to wipe our saucy fingers on.

Despite the tastiness of the ribs, there was just so much of it that even with the two of us sharing, we could not finish it.  It made for a tasty lunch the day after."

This is legit Northern Chinese food so do some research before coming otherwise it can be overwhelming. Check out my photos for ideas.
Food is not overly spicy, very well balanced, with great use of acid, expertly executed, big portions for an extremely fair price. Some servers speak limited English so do your research before going.
It can get packed during peak hours so try going off hours but not during their 2:30-4:30 break. BBQ is only served after 4:30.

We gobbled up the overcooked brussel sprouts with bland slivers of bacon and inhaled the roasted sweet potato pancakes ($8 including choice of bacon or sausage) which were the furthest thing from fluffly.  But it didn't matter because love is blind or, in this case, taste-blind.  We fell in love with the cuteness of this place as soon as we walked in.

We went for lunch on a Friday at peak hour and had to wait in line for almost 15min to place our order.   That was quickly forgotten when we managed to snag some comfy couches outside under the shade of a giant sun umbrella.

Our food was brought to us quicker than our wait in line.  (FYI, you're given a number on a stand which you put on your table.  This is brilliant because it allows you to sit anywhere you want after you place your order.)

Even more brilliant is the way they put together the tarts.  Instead of baking them ahead of time, they only bake the crust ahead and cook the fillings to order - this cuts down on wastage at the end of the day and speeds up cooking time.  Our mushroom tart was creamy and decadent ($9.50 includes choice of pear salad or brussel sprouts - salad was much better).

The cafe au lait ($2) was unfortunately on the watery side but the slim mint tea ($2.50) which comes in a large pot was delicious.

They're open 7am-3pm everyday except Monday and have recently  stayed open into the evening for First Fridays."

We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed.  Lamb's the weekend special so we order the lamb soup and the grilled lamb taco.  The shredded lamb in the taco tasted more boiled than grilled - we surmised that this was the reason for the tasty lamby soup.

We ordered a few tacos and liked the al pastor the best.  The dry-rubed spices had completely infused into the meat which combined with the smokiness of the charcoal grill made it one of the best al pastor we'd had.

Also liked the horchata - most places make it too sweet - this one was just right allowing other flavors to come through.

Okra coated in cornmeal was crunchy on the outside contrasting perfectly to the moist interior.  The sweet potato fries were disappointing - soggy and too sweet - would have preferred the use of salt instead of sugar to bring out the natural sweetness.

To top it off, his kitchen masterfully executes the cooking to bring out the best in each ingredient.  Even something as simple as french fries was super addictive with the creative use of Indian spices, delicious aioli and most important of all not-your-average potatoes that tasted extra potatoey.

Happy hour is served everyday 5pm-7pm and even though the price of everything else has gone up (as a small food biz owner I know all too well), small plates and wines are still only $5.  I have no idea how he makes any money at these prices.   The portions were perfect for the two of us and we order 4 plates (corndog, carpaccio, duck confit tacos and clams) plus the fries.

Outdoor seating is beautiful and relaxing.  Service was friendly and professional.  I've already planned my next meal here - the white truffle dinner on Nov 12th which is only $125 for five courses with wines paired.  There's no way you can get that low a price for that kind of a menu in LA, SF or NY.  We're talking lobster pot pie, pork belly sous vide, veal and even truffle in the dessert.

gPa_C5oQRvoiwQU6DuWS8A,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,5,"Crudo is two completely different concepts depending on when you go but the cooking is top-notch no matter when. The food is lovingly made in a tiny kitchen in a hair salon (yes, hair salon) by two experienced and talented chefs - Cullen and Brandon. No sous chefs, no line cooks - these two former exec chefs do it all - from french toast in the morning to salads and sandwiches to lunch to the some of the most sophisticated food I've ever had in the US in the evening.

The gift shop setting is a bit unusual but the customer benefits in a huge way. By not being beholden to investors and sky high Old Town Scottsdale rent, the chefs are able to deliver 6-star food that they're truly passionate about at super reasonable prices for dinner.

There is a serious lack of creativity and daring in most of the Valley but not at Crudo where it's done with sophistication. Crudo can be described as new-style sashimi - raw fish dressed lightly with some kind of oil and acid and garnished with tasty herbs, fruit or even black truffle shavings - giving the diner a delightful spectrum of flavors and textures. One of my favorites so far is albacore topped with crunchy strips of tart apple, intensely flavored black garlic and black truffle.

The freshness and quality of their raw fish surpasses most sushi restaurants in the Valley. I loved the madai red snapper they sourced in an auction from the best seafood market in the world - Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market. The fish changes weekly depending on the auction. Crudo is all about cooking in the season and local ingredients. I love the salad bar at lunch and seasonal vegetable crudo at dinner both using top notch produce from Maya's Farm. Personally I find salad bars in most places boring but here you find delicious atypical vegetables like crunchy purslane, sea beans, ramps and fennel fronds, which I had to fight other people for at NYC's Union Sq Farmers' Market.

Crudo is one of the most exciting restaurants in the Valley right now and at $30 for 3 savory courses, I plan to be there at least once a week."

Cibo is the average answer to Pizzeria Bianco.  I can't believe they've even been compared  - the only similarity I can think of is geography.  The crusts are worlds apart - at least on the night we went.

We chose to take some out of town guests to Cibo last night because of:
(1) all the praises we read on Yelp and other media
(2) the fact that it's one of the few well-regarded independent places open on a Monday night
(3) it looked cute from the outside

Apparently, other people thought the same.  All the tables for four were full inside so we took a table in the patio, which turned out to be a blessing because we got lots of privacy to talk.

The downside though was getting the attention of the waiter.  Ice water was poured and menus were handed out as soon as we sat down but the waiter appeared over 15 min later.  When we ordered a refill on a glass of wine after the appetizer, he came with it almost at the end of our meal.

We order the antipasto speciale, large ($17) to share.  The plate was huge:  generous slices of prosciutto, 3 slices of bresaola with shaved pecorino on arugula, 4 slices of grilled zucchini,  mounds of balsamic pearl onions, giant olives, grilled red peppers with capers and parmesan, and cherry tomatoes with bocconcini and basil.

Pizzas are split between Rosse (red) and Bianche (white).  On the waiter's recommendation, we ordered these:
- Red: Diavola (tomato sauce, mozz and spicy salame)  $13
- White: Siena (grilled zucchini, mozz, speck (smoked proscuitto) and pecorino)  $14

VERDICT: Cibo vs Pizzeria Bianco

The toppings were generous and tasty but the major complaint we had was the CRUST.  Pizza's all about the crust.  This was more like charred bread - it was not crusty in the least bit.  The dough had a nice chew to it but no crunch whatsoever.

Chris Bianco's dough is so brilliant because there's an awesome contrast between the crusty exterior and the pillowy interior.  Chris' crust is so thin that you can inhale slice after slice but here we had trouble eating more than 2 slices.

Even though this pizza was baked in a brick oven, there was no smokiness to it - almost as if it was flash-baked.  Pizzeria Bianco's crust not only has texture but a complex-flavored interior and smoky exterior.  Eating pizza will never be the same again...

WINNER:  Pizzeria Bianco"

We were a bit hesitant to try Bombay Spice after reading Mr K's review on their first location.  It seems that the owners have taken Mr K's advice to heart and upped the level of spice.

Bombay Spice offers a healthy interpretation of Indian food by not deepfrying, not using butter, ghee (clarified butter), or cream.

Unfortunately this means that the Samosa loses all crunch with the filling steaming up the outer pastry.  The potato filling was nicely spiced  but that still didn't make up for the soft exterior.

The Chickpea Ceviche - a grander name for the Indian street snack Bhel Puri on the other hand would have benefited from more spices.  The Pappadums that are offered with it is a nice crispy contrast to the cool and tangy combination of chickpeas, cucumbers, tamarind, mint and coriander.

Not sure why I ordered the Seared Scallops in landlocked Phoenix.  I still remember Spike on Top Chef this season madly drying his frozen scallops and still did not manage get the crispy outer sear on his scallops.  Similarly these had a nice dark sear but the exterior was not in the least bit crispy.  The veggie skewer accompanying it had nice smokiness from being chargrilled.

The lamb chops or more appropriately lamb lollipops on the other hand was overly spiced.  We wish it was served with some starch or even a few slices of cucumber for contrast.

A great alternative to the usually heavy Indian food.  I will definitely give them another try in hopes that they get their spicing under control.  I love the decor and the way the chef came out to describe food reminded us of ourselves at our ice cream shop.  Hooray for independents with innovative original concepts!"

We ordered the chips and salsa ($1) based on Calamari's recommendation which was wise as the food did take a while.  In fact, almost 20 min for one beef enchilada with rice and beans ($6.35) and one chicken green corn tamale with green chile sauce ($3.75).

The masa of the green corn tamale was tasty but the chicken filling was on the dry side, so we were definitely grateful for the spicey green sauce.  The enchilada was drowning in a red sauce and yellow cheese - I could not taste the shredded beef at all.

Service was actually quite decent.  The waiter took our order promptly, inquired about our food and got us the check promptly.

If I happen to be in the area again, I think I'd choose to eat at Pepe El Toro Mexican Food just 1 block North instead.  Although there's only counter seating and no ambience, the food is totally authentic and kick-ass tasty."

6ZIHxvFTHC1pvAzAS0uLDA,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"4-stars for value.  Great place to fill up on cheap, tasty sandwiches before or after shopping at Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket.

Menu offers:
- European sandwiches
- Asian sandwiches
- Gourmet coffee
- Smoothies, Asian iced drinks and Italian sodas
- Housemade ice cream

We've never had the urge to order the European sandwich.  The Asian one's all come with pickled shredded daikon and carrots, sliced onions, jalapeno, cilantro, mayo mixed with soy sauce on a crusty house-baked 10inch baguette.

Tip: If you're not eating it right away, ask for veggies on the side - otherwise the whole thing gets soggy.  This way it still tastes good the next day after toasting.  Plus they always give you more this way.

Our standard picks are:

#1. Lee's Combination Sandwich $2.20
- ham, headcheese (offcuts from the head of a pig/calf rolled in gelatin) and pate
- great contrast of textures and flavors between the 3 kinds of meat: crunchy headcheese vs soft pate (I can just picture some of you wincing.)

# 5. Grilled Pork Sandwich $2.20
- Grilled Vietnamese-style vs Chinese BBQ (#6), which we don't like as much because it's too sweet - we prefer savory with just a hint of sweetness and the charred smokiness from the grill

Cafe Sua Da $2.20
- Vietnamese drip coffee with crushed ice
- Lee's signature drink which they also make into ice cream
- As much caffeine as a quadruple shot

Too bad this is the only one in Arizona.  There are almost 30 in California.  Props to the owners - this is the most well-run Asian fastfood chain on the West Coast or maybe the US.  Evidence of their success is in the ridiculously large shiny space, huge baguette machine and expensive bathroom fixtures.  Fastfood never looked this good.

The owners added artwork brought over from Asia to make it their own - the East meets West look is really quite elegant.

Alfred the owner manages the front of house and his Burmese wife is in charge of the kitchen.  The couple's love and pride for what they do shows in every aspect from decor to service to food.  As a fellow small business owner I can really appreciate that.

We followed Alfred's recommendations and ordered the ""more"" Burmese dishes (vs other dishes with greater influence from bordering countries like Thailand and India).  We're glad we did because starting with the Tea Leaf Salad, we had a chance to taste things that we've never experienced before even after living many years in Bangkok.

Teeter House feels like a cozy home with separate seating areas and a 4-seater bar shared between a full alcohol bar and Nobuo's prep area.

We sat at the bar right in front of Nobuo and were entertained the whole night by his artistic preparation of what I would call new-style sashimi, along the same vein as what Crudo is doing in Scottsdale - small plates of fresh raw seafood dressed with flavored oils and local in-season fruits and vegetables. Each dish excited the palate with creative combinations of flavors, textures and temperatures, such as the Hirame Carpaccio topped with hot sesame oil at the table.

Unfortunately we missed the other side of the menu and will have to wait until next time to try the warm dishes. Although based on the mizuyokan we had for dessert, I am sure the kitchen puts out equally excellent food. The mizuyokan, a red bean pastry held together by gelatin or agar agar, had a velvety texture (a little firmer than panna cotta) and a perfect level of sweetness (less sweet than the cloyingly sweet versions I've had in Japan).

Carne asada was a tad dry but the adobada was full of flavor.  Rice was insanely salty which made us down a huge cup of Horchata.

7JR42RkKub9bsBSeXfAjew,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,3,"After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided to give China King (or Blue Sky Seafood - translation of their Chinese name) a try.

On the plus side, I have to say the servers were very eager - always asking us if there was anything else they could get us (though can't guarantee that they'd be equally attentive on a busy weekend).  While a couple of the dishes were solid (spare ribs, taro puff), the rest (including standards like ""har gow"") fell short.  Overall the experience was disappointing.

A big dim sum pet peeve of mine is lack of freshness.  Less than 10 seconds after we sat down, a steaming cart was pushed over from it's resting place to our table.  My question is how long has the cart been sitting around?  We'd find out soon enough.

From the steam cart we ordered (all $1.95):
- spare ribs in black bean sauce:  solid
- ""har gow"" (shrimp dumpling): dumpling skin was too thick, shrimp lacked crunch of freshness
- chive & shrimp dumpling: skin stuck to the paper in the steamer indicating that it had been sitting around for a while
- tripe with ginger and green onion: seasoning was overpowering

From the bake & deep-fry cart we ordered (all $1.95):
- ""ham sui gok"" (deep-fried glutinous rice balls filled with pork; interestingly, direct translation is salty water pastry) - this was completely soaked with oil
- ""wu gok"" (deep-fried taro filled with pork) - nice flaky ""bird's-nest""exterior and tasty pork filling

It was doubtful whether these were hot as they were just sitting on top of a cart with no heating element.  When we asked, the server offered to fetch us hot versions from the kitchen.  She came back very quickly so my guess is that these were sitting under heat lamps.

When we overheard the server telling the neighboring table that their cheung fun (rice noodle with filling) would take a couple of minutes because the chef was stretching it (like pasta), we decided to order one too:
- rice noodle filled with minced beef (same stuff as the beef ball) with a specially cooked soy sauce $2.95 - cheung fun was silky smooth but a bit on the oily side

In addition, we also ordered poached kai lan (aka Chinese broccoli) $4.50 - generous plate of veg that's been par-boiled, tossed in oil and then drizzled with oyster sauce.  This was again too oily and the thick stems were not peeled as they should've been.

For dessert, we had the steamed egg custard buns.  This was not on any of the carts but they will steam it to order when asked.  Our server warned us that it'd take 15 min.  Sadly, it wasn't worth the wait.  The skin of the buns were cracked - the dough was obviously not kneaded well enough for the gluten to hold it together.  The filling was more coconuty rather than eggy.

If you're not too picky on your dim sum and China King is convenient for you, then we'd say give it a go.

As for us, we'll continue to explore other dim sum options in Phoenix...and for a sure thing, we'd recommend China Chan on the Westside."
p4YvOzp42g3JzlXJny8F0g,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"When we asked some local Mexican friends where to go for authentic Mexican food and, in particular, mole, they unanimously recommended Pepe's.  Howard Seftel's AZ Republic review also recommended the chicken enchiladas with mole.

We went for lunch on a Sunday and fortunately did not witness any ""deals"" going down.  The restaurant's in a stand-alone building with ample parking.  It's spacious inside with high-backed wooden booths and a long bar.

We ordered:
- Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole:  3 flour tortillas wrapped around shredded chicken breast, covered with black mole and cheese, served with refried beans and rice
- Tacos Rancheros:  mildly spicy slow-braised pork in choice of soft or crispy taco

The verdict:
- The mole sauce was a delicious combination of spices and chocolate - we wished there could've been more.  I actually prefer dark meat so next time I'll order the Mole Poblano, where they give you choice of chicken leg or breast.
- Described as a house specialty, the pork was tender and infused with spices.  According to a review posted on the wall, chopped chorizo is also mixed in.

Dishes on average run between $8 to $10.

We're eager to go back to try the green corn tamales, taco monterrey (machado (sun-dried beef) w/ scrambled eggs) and of course, more mole!"
FtLibezRe7HsT13BLpR-Dg,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,3,"Checked Susie's out today with Alexander C.  Perhaps I was too absorbed with the conversation that I didn't notice the food or maybe the food itself just wasn't that special.

Between the four of us we ordered a bit of everything.  The soft tacos with lengua, cabeza and pastor were solid - would've been better with more onions and cilantro.  The green corn tamale was bone dry - it was obvious even before I put it in my mouth - the corn husk looked like it had never seen a drop of water.  My guess is that instead of steaming it to heat it up, they had just baked it or even worse, nuked it.

The best dishes seemed to be the soups - Alex's posole had the right color to it and my albondigas contained some tasty pillowy-soft meatballs.

I don't think Susie's is any cheaper than most of the other Mexican joints I've been at.  In fact, El Nopalito's tacos are only 99cents.  Susie's tacos were $1.45 and up.  Mexican food is in general cheap (depending on how much decor you're willing to give up), so the deciding factor is in the taste which Susie's, unfortunately, did not especially shine at."
W36vefYka0IZAPWygxJtqg,xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,4,"So we have been driving by this pizza joint that seems to be perpetually closed, yet it looks pretty interesting on the outside...especially on this particularly quiet stretch of Cave Creek Rd.  Turns out that Johnnie's is only open Thursday through Sunday.  Johnny himself mans the pizza counter, giving long hellos to everyone.  Apparently, he has been turning out pizza in this location since the 90s.  So it's a total neighbor joint with lots of kids and families dropping in.

I would recommend the deluxe on thin crust...you might be tempted to go for the Joanie (slightly thicker crust) or the medium crust...but don't give in to this impulse...the crust here is perfectly crisp and quite dense, so thin is more than sufficient to satisfy the hungry beast.  Johnnie's has fresh toppings and good sauce.  But they do take 20 minutes to make the pizza to order, so phoning in your order before hand is a good idea.

Oh yeah, and Johnny will let you customize your pizza anyway you want...down to quarters.

3 stars for the pizza plus extra star for super customization and Johnnie with his friendly greetings for all."

I was so glad there was room for three of us since it's too hot to sit outside now. Our food tasted amazing and our server(they don't usually start serving tables until 4pm) was SUPER friendly. We will definitely be back again..maybe on a Saturday night, just because her service was so amazing!"

We had a party of 9 and everyone was very very pleased. They don't take reservation on Fridays but I called ahead and they had our table ready when we got there. Our server was very friendly and did a great job with our orders. Our drinks were refilled as soon as they were empty. The food came out with perfect timing and tasted wonderful. There menu is not the biggest but there is someone for everyone. The guacamole is to die for. I believe most of their food is locally grown and organic. The prices are unbelievable compared to most restaurants in the area. I would definitley recommend this place for dinner,lunch, happy hour or brunch!"
XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,5,"Great healthy but tasty food!! The vegetable cruditee is a must, lots of perfectly blanched vegetables with two delicious dipping sauces. I have it every time I go! I love their pizza, the margarita pizza is simple but great crust and cheese. The other pizzas are always full of delicious toppings. I've been here with girlfriends, my boyfriend and by myself and every time I leave very satisfied. The covered patio is very relaxing and service is always great. I highly recommend this place! The pomegranate limeade with chia seeds is to die for!"

The food isn't the best, but the carnitas dinner and con carne dinner is delicious!! The service in the bar area is amazing!! Definitely worth trying for happy hour or anytime actually...They treat you like family and we always end up making new friends. There are a lot of regulars that go so it creates a nice friendly environment. I highly recommend this place!"
MgHWbwuxxb_txhI3lK_bKg,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,4,"Surprisingly delicious!! I went on a Saturday afternoon and I'm surprised it wasn't busier as the weather was perfect to sit outside. I never saw the inside, but I loved their patio. We were greeted immediately and told we could sit anywhere. The bus boy brought out water very quickly and our waitress took our drink order within a few minutes. The beer was delicious and the food was great. I had the BLT, and it's definitely one of my favorites! We also split the appetizer with meats/cheeses and olives and it was fantastic. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meals and beers. We will definitely be back!!"
iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,5,"This place is awesome!! I went for my first time after not going for at least 5 years. Boy, have we been missing out!! We went on a Saturday afternoon to watch the playoff game and we were impressed! We ended up having several waitresses/waiters because of shift changes but loved everyone of them!! I couldn't believe the amount of tv's..and I was worried we wouldn't get a good seat! They have a pool table on the patio, shuffleboard and really clean restrooms. There is not much more I could ask for. Their happy hour during football is awesome. We didn't try any of the food, but drinks were good and service amazing. I cannot wait to go back!! And can't wait until next football season!"
NCc227GObIORVxUXs-KWvw,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,3,"Pretty nice dive bar actually! I liked that they had so many dart boards and enough TV's to satisfy your football craving. The food was good, simple and well priced. I would highly recommend they have an additional waitress/bartender for the football crowd.  While it was not busy when we arrived, it slowly picked up and we had to walk up to the bar to ask for another drink and our check, and I believe the owner was sitting down the entire time? We will be back again though!

On a side note-I would not recommend this place for a ladies night , definitely bring a man or 2 with you!"
hVcnr0TMi500pJvghwnSOQ,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,3,"While I would give this place 5 stars for food/happy hour(try a martini), the service was not the greatest. I've been a couple times for happy hour and our bartender the first time(guy) was very friendly and knowledgeable. The second time however, the bartender(girl) acted like we were an inconvenience. She took a while to take our order despite being one of the only groups in the bar area then didn't ask if we wanted to order food or another drink. She took down the happy hour menus 15 before happy hour was over...as people were walking in and sitting at the bar. The hostess should wear a little more clothing and act somewhat happy to be there...I mean, she is greating people. I look forward to trying this place again, hopefully will have a better experience..

*side note- they really need to clean the Windows!"

I've loved everything I've tried, but the house chicken and xo string beans are my favorite! I've been several times and have also placed to go orders and have never been disappointed. If you like Chinese food, this place is a must. You are always greeted immediately and drinks are refilled as soon as your empty. They also give you free hot green tea. Can't say enough about how much I love this place!"

The drinks are extremely overpriced and if I wanted to go to Scottsdale i would. Definitely not the usual central Phoenix crowd. I liked that they had games but had no chance to play on a Saturday night. I can maybe see myself going back during a weekday, but probably not. There were also a lot of drunk guys constantly bumping in to people and dropping glasses."

7eQoxWr9RzyCB9IFvqHUPA,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,4,"Great atmosphere but not great service. We went on a Friday night, the music was perfect and the lighting was romantic. We ordered a little bit of everything, the caprese salad was good, I liked that you could poor your own amount of balsamic on it...the wings were just ok, pretty messy and our server did not leave us with any extra napkins and I had to eat HOT wings without a drink...I had an empty beer glass and was never offered water. I noticed waters on all of the other tables though. The owner looked at our table several times so I thought she noticed but nothing was done. The pizza was good, but need a little more sauce(i'm a sauce fan). We also tried the sausage lasagna and thought it was delicious.

We will probably go back again for a nice relaxing dinner but only order a pizza or pasta dish. I would recommend making reservations on a Friday night as after we were seated, the place got very busy.

Overall it's a nice place and worth a try if you've never been or if you are on a vegan/vegetarian diet."
VbuqVOVUT4HYXKI6B_S59A,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,4,"I wanted to update my review. I am more satisfied with the service and food has been great. Just a little comment, the chef should be a little more willing to accommodate special orders that are easy to do. Weather is perfect for their patio! I also recommend the burger special on the weekend."
qVQGfHphxolps16v6g5X-g,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,2,"Unfortunately, not what I expected. I went with 2 other friends a little more than an hour before they close(9pm). We walked in and the first lady looked at my like I was from another planet and I awkwardly said, umm we'd like to eat dinner? She then told the chef that it's going to be a long night..right in front of me! If your open for another hour, there should be no problem serving a customer. The décor is extremely outdated and the vibe is not comfortable at all. The portions are huge but food is bland. The carbanara had way to much sauce, no vegetables and very little bacon. The lasagna was ok, mine is better. The vodka sauce however was very delicious. The food was extremely overpriced I couldn't believe it!

I really wanted to like this place since it's a family owned restaurant but I will not be back."
kblFxfo_xnMUZF0U0aGXQw,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,3,"I've eaten here several times, the food is good but service is slacking. 4 star food/atmosphere but 2 star service. They used to have 2 great bartenders but they've since moved on. The current staff is extremely unprofessional, including the kitchen staff. They are always having there own conversations while we sit and wait for someone to fill our drinks or take our order. I've watched our food sit in the window for several minutes with no one else willing to deliver our food while the bartender is busy(no teamwork at all). They get overwhelmed very easily and can't handle a crowd. I've overheard the owner talking about how he hates yelp which is just not something you want to hear. We will be back as it's in the neighborhood and the unlimited sushi is a great deal on Saturdays."
_MHUEErH3KW_KvVSOjyYhg,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,1,"I hadn't tried Pat's in a while so my boyfriend and I decided to order it this last Saturday night. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was missing!! It just tasted like dough. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it and he is not a picky eater. We will never try Pat's again, especially for the price. I recommend Stumpy's or NYPD. What a waste of money!"
TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,5,Spinato's is wonderful!!! Their signature spinach pizza is to die for!! Every time we have a chance to order pizza for our work we always chose Spinato's. They are super friendly and we have never been disappointed.

BvTU8s3v-qfTtsSKV6Y16A,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,3,"Brunch is awesome!!!

I've been to Corbin's for brunch several times but never for just dinner. So, my boyfriend and I decided to try it out. We had a $10 off one entree from the valpak. We went on a Wednesday night, there was no one eating in the dining area and just a few people at the bar and sitting outside. We had ordered our food and a glass of wine and beer. Well........we saw the two tables outside that ordered after us receive their appetizers(fine)...and then their meals. Where was ours? Our waiter finally came by and said it was almost ready. We ordered the pan fried chicken and salmon.....which you wouldn't think would take very long. Well, 20 minutes after we were told it was almost done, the food finally comes out. We waited for at least 45 minutes for our food and the waiter didn't even offer an excuse as to why it took so long. The chicken was good, but asparagus had no seasonings and the hard ends were not cut off. My boyfriend said the salmon and side of veggies had no flavor whatsoever(he makes better). Thank goodness they served it with a lemon!  We were very disappointed with the wait and the food :( We will only be back again for brunch. I still can't figure out why it took so long and why we weren't given a reason. Also, each dish was $17-NOT WORTH THE PRICE! Sorry Corbin's, but had to share my experience!"
l8k4gOEkfoLKq0mPVWHWGg,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,2,"The food deserves 4 stars, but experience deserves 1 star. We went because I had living social deal and won't go back. We went on a Friday night at 7 and was glad that there was an open table. We had the pita & hummus and split the rocky point burger, both were delicious. I gave them 2 stars because of the atmosphere. I understand it's a sports bar and can be loud, but one of the servers was in on her day off I'm assuming and brought your small child in..fine...but we could have done without the yelling and high pitched screaming/baby talk. They acted like no one else was there and several tables seemed annoyed with it. It definitely ruined our experience and am surprised management allowed it to go on as long as it did. At one point they were so loud, all of the tables looked over. I would think you would behave a little more maturely at your place of employment but guess I'm wrong. We had to listen to it the ENTIRE meal. Even thinking about it now is making me angry, real mature!"
utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,3,"I was super excited to try this place but unfortunately I have more negative things to say than positive.
Pros: The food. We had the breakfast pot pie which was delicious! It only comes with 1 egg on top so I ordered a second egg for $2. The pancake trio(upside down pineapple, blueberry and strawberry)They were all very tasty but also very sweet. We also ordered the Benny Benedict which was delicious. They have a nice size menu with lots of options..I think they had 7 types of eggs benedict? We ordered family style to share between 3 of us. The hash browns were fantastic!!

Cons:
-There's no place to sit/wait for your table. We were awkwardly standing in the way of people coming in and out. They have a bar area but it was busy and didn't have many seats.
-They ask for your phone # to text you when your table is ready...I really didn't care to have to check my phone every few minutes to see if our table was ready.
-Bathroom...very small, 2 stalls and the hand dryer is right in front of the stall so you can see someone drying their hands while you're using the restroom.
-Worst part...the service!! Michael was our server and he couldn't have cared less. He was busy but a smile wouldn't have killed him. He was very cold and seemed like he was in a hurry to leave or had something else on his mind. We had to flag him down for refills/water. Someone else brought our food out, the pancakes came first....then we waited and waited for the rest of our food. He never checked on us or asked how our food was. We waited for quite a while for him to pick up our check while watching him do his side work.

Overall the food was delicious but service was all over the place. We went on Saturday around 1:30."
3U__XOTBFptjhBeHrPGqrg,eTp3A7h7MHwHjeFvd8vnlg,3,"Overpriced for a restaurant that doesn't have servers. The hummus was ok, but be prepared to buy more pita bread as it doesn't come with enough for all of hummus. I prefer the hummus across the street at the Vig. We tries the georgies pizza which was pretty tasty and had a nice crust(chicken,garlic, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes). One of the girls that works there was outside smoking and I did not see her wash her hands when returning to work. She was also somewhat sitting on the ground behind the counter on her phone. The staff seemed like they were bored and just leaning on the counter talking. I prefer a more professional staff when paying these prices. The inside was clean and modern with nice views of 16th st. I will not return...I'd prefer to go Greektown if I'm in the mood for Greek food."

Kimchi pancakes, spicy pork bbq lunch special.

The seasoning on the pork bbq wasn't what it used to be.
It seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland.
The sauce is probably watered down.
It lost the yummy sauce/ flavor/ seasoning it used to have.

The kimchi pancakes weren't that great either.

I used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times,
I think I might as well just cook at home (and deal with the dishes later)"

If you're gonna go,
go during lunch, and CALL IN your order.
Most things take 20-25 min to make.

I usually call in to go from the 5 dollar lunch menu during the weekday.

My fav: pepperoni pizza (gives me AWFUL gas in the afternoon tho lol.. a tradeoff)
or the meatball half hogi served with chips.
They have been consistently good.

Veggie pizza was tasty as well, but they only put itty bitty bits of toppings on the lunch portion pizza,... its mostly crust lol

First time: they don't pick up the phone.
I hung up, called again in about 10 min.
I was put on a length hold after they did finally pick up.

Food takes about 20-25 min to make once the order is placed.

They keep the food warm even if you're running late, so I thought that was kinda cool.

Usually the staff is friendly. Depends who you get but so far most of them have been very nice.

$7 for the crepe, $2 for ice cream, and $2 more for whipped cream. Total 11 USD before tax and tip.

The pizza ""Latina"" was okay,... I had better. All the toppings fell right off, including the cheese.
The crust was puffy and airy, and the center was extremely thin.

The server was tall handsome lanky and friendly.

The venue was loud alive, lots of ppl, had a lot of flies too, even indoors.

I liked how the windows opened to let outside air in.

It looks like a house was converted into a restaurant. The red bricks are charming.
The lawn/garden /patio is welcoming.
I liked the art on the walls.

There's only one walk-in bathroom for both genders.

Its a nice little oasis from the hustle and bustle of downtown.

Perhaps I'll return for the crepes in the future if I happen to be in that side of town."

The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland.
Sauce didn't mix well with the pasta either.
The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own.
If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p

The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce.

I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly.

Appetizer: calamari was yummy.

I just wish they could kick it up a notch on the pasta with richer sauces, seasoning, texture, more tomato/meat/cheese and really blending it with their pasta.

Orange chicken at this place was dry, lacking sauce, and way too crunchy with a slight hint of burn.

I usually get pork.

choose your veggies such as mushroom, zuchini squash, bean sprouts, tofu, etc.

Throw some rice noodles into your bowl.

Add sauce. Add at least 5 to 6 scoops or you won't even taste it.
cooking oil, sesame oil, lots of spicy thai, chili oil -- thats the way I like my food.

Hand it over to the Grill guy and wait.

Get your finished food, grab a drink, utensils, soup, and go seat yourself and eat.

There are no servers so that saves quite a bit on tips"
EuPaczO6rMpDMrn-GtE_eA,vGkha82V8Y9fog6iddlTQA,1,"The owners are Korean, the lady was really nice.
She made eye contact and smiled and greeted us.

The guy... I don't think he meant to be racist,
but when a couple Latinos/ ppl of Hispanic decent came in the store and orders,
he goes ""Amigo, someting wrong?""
I could not believe my ears lol.

The food... I can cook better (and I'm pretty pathetic)

I ordered sukiyaki and my bf ordered bulgogi.

Sukiyaki was just veggies (carrots and lettuce) on top of rice. almost no meat.
Bulgogi was not well seasoned.

The food was bland and nasty.

Was NOT worth the 15 bucks. Would not go back again."
JzOp695tclcNCNMuBl7oxA,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,So impressed! My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and although we had to wait about 20 mins for a table it was well worth it. The beer was really good and the food was great. Our service was really good too. Can't wait to come back!
dQrDogW_V4fB83vTTAP5eA,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,Had a great experience here! Loved the service and food.. & My boyfriend liked the dark beers. I recommend the bruschetta and the pretzel!
dIA4aUlrRHthZDH5oqwuvg,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"My boyfriend and I came here for a date night and decided to sit at the bar. He ordered a Hefeweizen and I ordered a sangria and then a cranberry and vodka. The drinks were great, and the beer was nice and cold. We ordered calamari from the happy hour menu and it was pretty good. Nice presentation and it came out quick. We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to share and it was delish. The bartender was really nice and attentive even though she was busy. Will be back again. :)"
-ubMwuskT2uS0GPSZpxaxA,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"So I have a couple things to say. #1 My boyfriend called a couple days ahead of valentines day to make sure the bar was open for happy hour and the hours of operation were normal and he was told that on valentines day that it would be normal hours. When we got there at 4:30 the bar was full and had an hour and a half wait because they actually opened at 4 that day. We waited, got a spot at the bar and were served..#2 The bartenders were so amazing and accommodating. They made everyone's drinks fast, and delicious. And they were on top of everything. Had an amazing dining experience(other than the hour wait)."
P3ufH0wm0jvulnrinDpaAA,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"So I have been to this location 4 times now and have come to the conclusion that this is the only BWW that I will ever like. All the other locations have terrible service and the servers make you feel like an inconvenience but NOT this location. This location is always busy, which is not a big deal to me. The service I have experienced has always been great and the food (wings) is awesome! I will keep coming back with friends, great place to eat and have drinks."
qdHFUvFhZjvNie3cZiJb9w,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"Absolutely hands down the best steakhouse on the West side of town. I've been a few times and the food is amazing, and the service has been fabulous each time. Get the butter cake as a desert if you have room, it's like nothing I've had before. Really great place."
qnn9E-e9orYf_wK37yLTYw,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,4,I had the tacos and mixed and matched the 3. The best was (not surprisingly) the award winning BBQ taco. The rice is delicious! I also had the blood orange margarita and I will definitely get it again. So good. Will be back.
AFgPDQm_pczo5uV3yQBgwg,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,Went in last week which was there first week open. Although they only had a few menu items available at the time we decided to the them out. The Nutella waffle (don't remember the name) was delicious. We even grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for the food and I loved the bartenders. We will be back soon to try out other menu items soon! :)
pHpU8lnnxMuPWRHOysuMIQ,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"I have been here quite a few times now, and each time the food and service is on point. I love all of the different bruschetta options, and my favorite thing to get is the Malbec burger. It's SOOO good. And of course the Salut fries are delicious. The last time I went I got a margarita and it was made perfectly and it came out quickly. Happy returning customer :)"

8Vpfy_WtcVvZS8Wfz7JQJA,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,I have eaten here many times. Although I have never been to Louisiana I would imagine that the food at Flavors is just as good. It's always fresh and delicious and reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly as well. I have tried many items on the menu and everything is delish. They have a lot of seating as well so having a large party isn't a problem.
Kq2fw7SAKOLOmiJyVCbeFA,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"Have been here twice since their opening and have had 5 star experiences both times. I had the Delmonico the first time and the Rib Eye the second time. The table shared the Red Velvet Butter Cake and I have to say, it was amazing! I will definitely be back - and I can't wait to try out their happy hour in the bar!"
s2gjJKptpkmwSXYRtfptZQ,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,2,Service sucks so bad here. Food is alright and drinks are pretty tasty. But this time it took our server forever to get us any thing to drink and take our food order. She checked on us once-we had to go up to the bar to get new drinks. Disappointed
j0_DUr3vBXY-JP-b0bf93A,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,3,"The iced chai with espresso is pretty good. Nice open layout with minimal/interesting decor, but there was strange nature-ish music playing over the speakers. Might grab a chai if I'm in the area again."
SdO1UHwE8Rjz3Pz2lBUa5w,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"Went here with a large group of people and it was great. Food is tasty and I love the decor. A little pricey but it's worth it for some good BBQ. It was super busy so we waited a while in the line, but that may be because this is a new restaurant. Overall we had a good experience and I will be back."
V4grJe-q0xBiU2PBrxk96Q,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,Surprising place to have a GOOD pizza but I have to say I'm super impressed with this place. They have a GF pizza as well!
OoYwJANV9zD-_OA4Atu-gg,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,3,Eh. The food is kind of bland and the staff wasn't very attentive. The only good thing there is boba tea which is probably the only reason I'll go back.
qXoVYptJRQg6Jt7NLvGv-A,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,5,"I love greek food and this place definitely satisfied my craving! Everything came out quick and had great flavor. I loved the Merlot too, one of the best I've had. The patio is beautiful and has a beautiful fire pit & nice heaters to keep you warm in the winter. I will definitely give this restaurant more business."
_gO1inMQhfXlK_S46SgGJA,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,2,"I really really want this place to succeed.. But I have not been impressed with their service. Each time I've been in (multiple times) the girls are so SLOW to get to us and then get our drinks. Also, the margarita tasted like it came from a pre-made mix that I could go buy at Fry's. There is also a plethora of girls standing at the front doing nothing while we wait and wait for service which seems to happen every time we go. I hope the staff continues to get better customer service training."
JKsYM4eFoRtftDHbEf2j9g,-szffXRDPunwOj4oJsLP8w,3,"I will start out by saying the crepe was pretty good, and the presentation was nice. However, the plastic forks and knives that were available suck, I could barely cut my crepe into bite sized pieces because my plate kept sliding around because the flimsy knife couldn't handle the crepe.

The chai latte was just okay, there was gritty stuff on the bottom of my drink so I'm thinking it's made from a mix.

Might come back for a crepe sometime but not good enough to be a regular treat."
nkHaix6KenApS8M-liZsCQ,Bze8ZkwBTNFGiTOv6ExaeA,3,"So, the BF and I ate here on Saturday in the afternoon as I had noticed it on a recent shopping trip to the Biltmore.

The decor and ambiance is first class and I found our service to be pretty good, but rich...oh my gosh!! I didn't need to eat anything the rest of the day (which is super unusual for me!) as I was so full from our lunch! It felt like everything was loaded with duck fat, truffle oil and butter, which normally I would not complain about, but this was too much!

We were starving when we arrived, so right away we ordered a yummy bottle of champagne (interesting wine list!), the duck confit salad and the truffle fries that we had spotted as we were seated at our table. The fries were delicious and the portion was huge! The salad was very tasty, but we were both surprised by the large duck leg and thigh on the plate with a yummy, ashy piece of Humboldt Fog cheese and small bunch of greens. It was good, but my goodness was it rich!

The BF was still hungry (how, I have no idea!) and had been eying the polenta and veggie sides, so we ordered those as well. Both were legitimately dripping in butter. Again, I am a girl who loves a rich meal, but this was a bit much!

I will say that as we were leaving, Crush (the attached bar) was packed and both the BF and I commented that we would be up for trying the bar soon as it looked like a fun place to hang out and enjoy their happy hour.

All in all, be prepared for over the top, decadent options that individually are bombs, but all together is a little too much!"
XPDzKfrq5uzz4o82eCZI7w,Bze8ZkwBTNFGiTOv6ExaeA,4,"This place is a solid 4 and 1/2 stars with a great fresh, local menu and fantastic wine list!

My last meal here was excellent with a very knowledgeable and honest server who provided a great dining experience.

Some of the highlights were the asparagus, the beet salad and the short ribs! Oh my gosh did I love all 3 and I have been craving hominy ever since!! Plus, they even had a favorite bottle of wine that my BF and I covet that can't even be bought at the vineyard anymore (I'm not telling as I know they have one other bottle left and I don't want anyone to drink it!!)

Decor is a little Scottsdale circa 1987, but you can tell that this is a great kept secret in Scottsdale! I will definitely be back!!"
LKeKUAHG-efbhckXsV8iKw,aU2-007EvjYVGzvswJ-4LA,2,The muffin I had was still and dry the menu board was hard to read because of the Sun. I ordered a breakfast sandwich for someone else it looked good and they said it tasted good it was prepared very quickly

Its a chill joint. very noisy food is big and fattening beer is ice cold. if you want fun and easy go here. its a chill bar but the crowd here is business men on lunch and tourists so people are cleaned up a bit. not a roll out of bed joint

I always get great service, they care about your driving ability after a few dirty blonde's (house beer)

First impression is great everyone must go at least one and attended on at least one major holiday!"

4nLqlBBt6jcvphkIQxz0gQ,DOTzP2qNughplMwJeoPdwg,1,"I go here quite a lot with the family. I must agree with a few other reviews, the service is lousy. Today was the final straw. I went there by myself because I finally had some along time. Upon entering, I asked for a table for one. He stated that he seats the single people in the bar. I told him that I would prefer to sit in the dining area. He did not like that and since I was giving attitude by him, I gave it right back. I told him that I may be here alone but I am far from single. This shut him right up.

Now, for the service. I do not know if it was because I was by myself or what, but I waited for 15 minutes before anyone even had asked if I had been helped. Which was a big fat NO. I ordered my drink and food. Once, my food arrived, I was not checked on for anything else until I flagged someone down for the check.

I can honestly say that I will not go back here again, which is really sad because I love there food here."
x7RRLRKyKdME9X3GuR5-5w,DOTzP2qNughplMwJeoPdwg,4,I come here a lot when I have a group of people to feed.  The prices are right and the food is good.  The service is good.  I like to sit in the patio area when the weather is good.
gw_FwWL0zv-HLxQvnDI3Vg,DOTzP2qNughplMwJeoPdwg,4,"I do not eat here a lot, but when I am hungry and do not feel like spending a lot of money, this is the place to go.  There fiesta potatoes are the best!!!  When I do eat here, I have to work twice as hard at the gym."

4ur9rn9VNVaGqFf3qrTcQQ,DOTzP2qNughplMwJeoPdwg,3,"I have never had bad service here, but the donut selection is the same as a local supermarket.  With that said, they do make some good specialty donuts.  I do not go here a lot, but I will continue to go when they have new flavors."

My kids are already asking when can we go back."
RhcWq78faX-jmmKwVE35ow,DOTzP2qNughplMwJeoPdwg,3,This place was pretty good for what we ordered. I ordered a cheeseburger and my husband ordered the beef brisket sandwich with beans. My cheeseburger was okay. My husband said his was pretty good. The beans were a little sweet which was unusual for beans. I would try this place again if I was in the area.

When I made the reservation, they could have said they do not serve a full menu till 5:00. We were only aloud to order off the appetizer and pasta menu.  I will give this place another sometime but not anytime soon."

The Delux Burger brings you a little closer to heaven. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Topped with a guyere and blue cheese mixture, coupled with sauteed onions and arugula. All on a brioche bun. The ingredients are super fresh and the meat is all grain-fed. Mommy daddy this thing is a symphony in my mouth!

Then add this lovely burger into an equation of a massive beer list. Not your usual Crud Light but lovely Microbrews. AND good prices? AND they are open until 2am 7 days a week?!? Not to mention that the service was outstanding?

I'm floating on a cloud.
Please don't get me down.
The taste of Delux Burger and Sunbru is lingering in my mouth.
What's that?
I'm slipping!
The Burger is weighing me down.
Falling.
NO!

Damn.

I contemplated ordering another Burger to get that moment back...I guess I will have to come back tomorrow..."
roz-ed8kvBF6fwKBPeJ49Q,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,5,"I have been to this tutti santi numerous times over the past 5 years. Last night we decided it was time to indulge once more.

We ordered the gnocchi as well as the daily special, lobster ravioli. I normally scarf a plate of gnocchi as they are handmade and delicious. Needless to say, I was scared to venture out my box.

The gnocchi were divine as usual...handmade daily, with the perfect mix of white sauce and bolognese. The lobster ravioli were delicious. Also, freshly made topped with an awesome vodka sauce. Furthermore, the lobster was so fresh, as if it was still swimming in the ocean.

To put the finishing touch on our wonderful dinner experience, our server brought over the signature shots of flaming sambuca, including the ""three flies"" (as they are called), symbolizing the past, present and future...If I had to predict the near future, I would say that we will be back soon.

Finally, our server was awesome and friendly. After all, you can't have a perfect dinner with shitty service."
oMtdUzMdo5W5qrldiOGROg,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,3,"Meh...let me start off by saying that I am super spoiled when it comes to good Sushi.

I went there during happy hour a couple of days ago. What was nice is, that the drink specials were good. $2 for a large Asahi is A-OK and awesome in my book. What made me frown a bit is that there was absolutely no happy hour for food. A bit of a let down to be honest.

We ordered three rolls..The Chimichanga roll, Asparagus roll and Diamondback. First of all...15 bucks for a specialty roll? And there is nothing special about it...unless you consider drowning the roll in spicy mayo and eel sauce? Maybe that was to mask the uber-fish taste of the spicy tuna? I don't know. I think they should have called this sushi soup...

Finally, the service. It was ok. Nothing more. Not even an ounce more. Very impersonal and not very efficient.

Overall not impressed. The only thing that pushed it to three stars were the drink specials. Maybe they should rename the joint to ""booze brokers""...just a thought..."
PzsrU41s4-QCUdb7lua2GQ,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,2,"Yes, I know I shall be hated for this review, but that is a-ok with me.

So, we ventured to the place that is the talk of the town...well for the moment at least. It was time for happy hour and time for me to treat myself to a tasty strong beverage.

The layout of the place is awesome, especially with the stage in the middle and a bar right in front. It is immediately apparent, that we are surrounded by cougars and older men. Ok cool, at least the bartender in her hot little corset looked like she was our age...too bad that her attitude sucked to say the least and she had no clue what was going on. Aaaaanyways, back to this tasty beverage..

We order the strawberry kiwi martini, calamari, a Caesar salad, and quesadilla.

Ok ok, I know, what the hell was I thinking, ordering a strawberry kiwi martini if I wanted something strong. My fault, but it sounded delicious. Well, epic fail. Aside from the fact that there was ZERO alcohol in the drink, I was more overwhelmed by the exfoliating action my tongue was getting from all of the kiwi seeds. Yucky.

On to the food. Well...after waiting for a loooong time it finally arrived. The Caesar salad was tiny - and we ordered the full size. They should have brought me some chop sticks or even better tooth picks to eat it with, maybe then it would have filled a small crevice in my stomach. Then the calamari. Yes, I know we are in the desert, but come on...don't feed me some chewy crap drenched in buffalo sauce - even though the sauce was probably the best thing. The quesadilla was solid, but what can you fuck up there?

Overall, bleh. Nice try, but a definite fail. Not impressed with the service, the drinks, the food, or the servers to be honest."
_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,4,"Yum yum yum...

Let's start off with the service...our server was awesome. We had to wait quite some time before being seated and were starving. So she brought us some bread and butter to hold us over.

We started off with some wings. They are absolutely delicious here. My suggestion is to request a mix of the honey sauce and the medium sauce. It is finger-licking good. Literally.

On to the pizza. It was really good. Nice thin crust, baked to perfect crispy perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the amount of sauce was great. I hate getting a thin crust pizza with too much sauce. Soggy thin crust is an oxymoron to me.

If you manage to have room, you HAVE to indulge in the baked cookie. You have the choice of peanut butter, macadamia nut or chocolate chip. OR you can do half and half. So worth the extra hour on the treadmill...

The only downside...the wait time can be long, especially on weekends. The upside to the downside, the servers do come by frequently to liquor you up and make the wait a little more bearable..."
_DPJ_PHJnXsuhYhsgBA0Xw,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,4,"When my birthday dinner rolled around, I could think if only one place to go: durants.

We arrive and the table is perfectly set. Our server seems nice and attempts to take our order. Problem is, we are way too sidetracked. She's patient though, for which I commend her.

We order a bottle of champagne and continue to munch on chilled veggies.

For starters we order a halfdozen oysters. Now, since living in Portland, I am terribly spoiled when it comes to oysters. They were good. Especially considering that we are in the desert.

For entrees we have the filet, ribeye, and prime rib.When the food came, my plate was missing in action.  Eh, whatever. They corrected it within about five minutes. Everything tasted delicious. The primerib is my favorite though - paired with garlic mashed potatoes and au jus to die for! Perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Yum!

To sum it up: delicious food with a gorgeous ambiance. Don't forget your wallet though. Not cheap."
_WtxQbDK7B-ExGdeG-2j6Q,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,5,"A place with tons of character amidst the jungle of strip malls.

If you have not ventured to the Rokerij, it is time to do so quickly. I highly recommend going there for happy hour in the wine cellar like bar. Caution: be careful when you are trotting down the stairs, they are steep. Totally worth the risk though.

Once downstairs you are immediately greeted by the lovely fireplace as well as the lovely music and delightful smell that fills the air. During happy hour, all small plates are $5, which gives you the perfect opportunity to eat your way through various dishes.

The drinks are also lovely, and the wine list is superb. I highly recommend the brie toasts and  chile relleno. All dishes are full of flavor with a nice little kick to awaken the senses. Aside from happy hour, the brunch menu coupled with mimosas or bloody marys is the perfect hangover cure.

As I am walking into the Grapevine, I am invited by a gorgeous and cozy patio. Only the smokers are mingling there, due to the cold. Nice...I shall join them soon.

I enter and am all of a sudden in a small room, with two massive table things. Nothing but darkness and the sound of Elvis in the background. I was instantly confused. WTF is going on here?!?!

As I creep around the bar, I discover the backroom - packed with people of all sorts, an energetic DJ lady and various tunes blasting out of the karaoke machine that my grandmother most likely swayed her hips too. Shall I be scared or embrace it? I embrace it and feel oddly at home.

Since I don't have much of a singing voice, I opt for the other option: Liquor. I order the bloody mary, others order the margarita. Both were..meh. And pricy to be honest. The menu was huuuuge...talk about selection! The only thing missing from the menu, since it was all over the place, was Sushi. We order the chuck burger. Solid; as it should be for $7.50.

The BIGGEST negative, that left me with a horrible aura, was the bartender. No personality, rude, and just nothing I want to encounter again. This drug the star count down.

Deliciousness.

Even if you never have the food here, the pineapple Stoli martini is indescribable. Hence, my description: slurp slurp. That's all one could hear. Ahhhh...

On a serious note, the Stoli Vodka is infused for weeks with pineapple, then iced, and...voila....the Pineapple Stoli Martini is ready. Sometimes, simplicity makes for the best cocktails. Sure you can jump through hoops and do a backflip (which would be entertaining), but it doesn't mean it is worth it for me to test my taste buds.

The food here is awesome as well. We had the truffle fries, clam chowder, chopped salad and the crab and lobster cakes. All were delicious!

A little less delicious? The prices. BUT...that is to be expected with some places, the Capital Grille being one of them.

The service was outstanding. It better be!

My meal of choice at the Capital Grille: two Pineapple Stoli Martinis and their bread. Sold and done. Next, please roll me outside, chauffeur me home and tuck me in! Thanks."

This place has all of the tasty, greasy goodness one needs to complete a day, or week, or month for that matter. The Fry bread is made fresh and you can most certainly taste it. Again, it is definitely greasy, so if you are on a health trip, you may want to avoid this place. For the rest of us, who indulge, this is worth every pound.

The meat was cooked perfectly. The sour cream was abundantly present. The cheese was in all the right places (everywhere). And the fry bread was greasy, crunchy, and light all at the same time. Not sure how they pull it off, but they do.

I would suggest to go there for lunch for the following reasons:

-a wonderful break from work
-leaves you in a food coma, meaning that the rest of work with fly by
-it gives you the rest of the day to work the grease off
-just makes the day better!"

Oh where to begin the ode to In and Out? How about the fact that the meat is fresh and the french fries are freshly cut? Oh, I missed you In and Out! And all the veggies are fresh too? AND the milkshakes are just flat out delish?

Be prepared for many people to share your space, as most likely they share the desire for these delicious burgers. For the same reason, there is usually a line. What is nice about all of this, is the fact that even though it is super busy, the service is still great! People are friendly, and the food is still fresh when you get it.

If you're looking for Chicken or Tofu, this is not the place.

And if you don't feel like going inside, consider the drive through. As you are patiently waiting, there is a massive window allowing you a front row view into the kitchen. Makes me feel a bit like a stalker, but surprisingly entertaining. You will feel as though you are waiting for your last meal on earth...but then again, it may as well be."
TffDDLGfej2dqD9LPEuArQ,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,4,"Thursday came and you know what that means! Boneless wings!!!!

We were serving and ready to devour a pound of wings each. The server comes to take our order. Some young dude who thinks he's way too cool, except for the fact that he's not. Whatever. I ignore it. Just give me mah beer and shot.

Drinks arrive. I'm happy.

Ten minutes pass. Where the fuck is Mr. Cool?

I want my wings!!!

Finally he decides to grace us with his presence and jokes. Takes our order. Go away now.

On to the wings. Delicious as usual. The vast array of sauces mixed with perfectly cooked wings. My only gripe? Why do I have to pay for ranch??? Whatevs. It's worth it!

Sidenote: This was the only sketchy experience I've had with a server here...hence the 4 stars."
ZMgBp4XmiEHYAuXKbe1hUw,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,3,"So....shall we start off with some positives?

Ok. The beer selection here is good and the happy hour drink specials are not bad. AND there is a plethera of flat screen TVs that surround you. It's definitely hard to decide whether to stare at the TV or the big tata's attached to the servers. I managed to find a happy medium.

The menu is has great variety, but the food itself was only ok. I ordered the Sloppy Jane, the other half ordered a Salad. The sandwich was huge and messy, just how I like it. The first three bites were devine, and then it started tasting soggier and soggier. The salad was bleh.

As to be expected, the place is definitely a sausage fest...BUT a good place to go to, to catch a game or have a quick drink. I don't think I would linger long enough to watch the masses get wasted though..."
oLod-GlOLEH4KAvyddKuQQ,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,1,"Umm...W-T-F?!??!!!

Came here to grab some food and a drink. First of all, the place was dead and the decor/vision of the place seems all over the place. But whatever. We seat ourselves.

After about 15 minutes the server comes over and asked what we wanted to drink. And then tosses some menus on the table, while saying: ""Sorry guys, we just opened. We don't have a fucking clue what's going on"". Fine. Beers arrive. The menu did not look impressive. At all. I ordered fries and gravy. Not much you can mess up there right? WRONG. How about salt-less stale fries and gravy that tastes as if it crawled out of a can.

But this gets better...
Server: Omg, did you guys see that guy?
Me: What guy?
Server: The one that was just arrested outside?
Me: Excuse me?!?
Server: Oh yeah! It was crazy...he walked in here with his penis hanging out.
Me: WHAT?????????
Server: Yeah, it was just hanging out.
Me: Ummm...check please.

Bad food? Overpriced beer? And crazies? No thanks."
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,DtnH690w5H1Yb681egz5wA,5,"Dear Roka Akor,

Is it ok if i just call you Roka? I feel that we are on a 'first-name' basis now. It was just recently, that I met you...but you came into my world like a whirlwind...i hope you can look past the fat rolls that are inevitably going to form.

Every meeting has been amazing, but the last time was unlike anything I've ever experienced.

It was Valentine's Day and you had a romantic evening planned for me. Even though I've had experiences with tasting menus (wink wink), yours was by far the best.

Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus
Kumomoto Oyster with Yuzu
Sashimi Selection
Lobster Miso Soup with Wakame
Yuzu Marinated Black Cod w/ Robata Grilled Asparagus with Sweet Soy
Creekstone Prime Filet and Chili Ginger Sauce w/ Robata Grilled Mushrooms with Soy Garlic Butter
Japanese Wild Mushroom Risotto
Double Chocolate Ganache Cake

Everything was delicious. You even made me like mushrooms!

I was full, content and happy.

Then it happened - you wanted me to pay?! 79 bucks? AND I had to tip you? I thought I was special...that we had something!!!

It's ok though. You were worth every penny. And even though you make me feel a little dirty and very guilty, I can't wait to meet with you again.

Passionately,

Jana"
